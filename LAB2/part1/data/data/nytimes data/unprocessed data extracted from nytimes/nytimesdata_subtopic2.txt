CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — The families of several University of North Carolina women’s basketball players complained last week of racially insensitive remarks by Sylvia Hatchell, the program’s Hall of Fame coach, who was subsequently put on leave, according to two people with direct knowledge of the allegations.
Hatchell’s lawyer, Wade M. Smith, said in an interview Thursday that his client was aware of the accusations that were described in detail by one of the people with direct knowledge. He said his client’s words had been misquoted or misconstrued.
The families detailed their concerns in a meeting that some U.N.C. officials attended in Chapel Hill while the athletic director, Bubba Cunningham, joined by video conference from another location, according to the person who described the meeting and spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation.
The meeting included accusations that Hatchell had warned that a loss to Louisville could lead to “nooses,” according to the person, and that the coach had once urged players to do a “tomahawk chop” war cry, a request the women resisted.
Within days of the meeting, the university, which has been in the midst of
a reckoning over racism and Confederate history
, announced that Hatchell and her three assistants would be put on paid administrative leave while an outside law firm conducted a review to “assess the culture of the women’s basketball program and the experience of our student-athletes.”
The announcement stunned North Carolina and appeared abrupt, but in the discussion with university officials on March 28, players’ relatives said Hatchell’s conduct had caused discomfort during at least two basketball seasons, according to the person.
The families also told university officials that Hatchell had complained that her team played like “old mules” during a game against Georgia Tech — a remark that some took as a reference to female slaves and that caused at least one player to cry, according to the person.
In another instance, according to the person, the families said that Hatchell had warned that if U.N.C. turned in a middling performance against Louisville, “nooses” would await.
“If you guys play this way against Louisville, they’re going to take y’all outside with some nooses,” Hatchell said, according to the person, who was told of the remark by people who were present.
The reference to “nooses,” the person said, led to two apologies from Hatchell, the second because players thought the first one had lacked sincerity. The players remained frustrated with their coach but elected to wait until the off-season to address their concerns.
Smith said the coach had used different words when warning about the coming Louisville game. “She said words like: ‘They’re going to hang us out to dry. They’re going to take a rope and hang us out to dry,’” the lawyer said.
Smith said his client “doesn’t have a racist bone in her body.”
Allegations of racism against Hatchell were first reported by The Washington Post.
Five days after U.N.C.’s season ended, with a 20-point loss to California in the opening round of the N.C.A.A. tournament, the families voiced their grievances in the meeting.
A North Carolina athletic department spokesman declined to comment. When the university announced the review on Monday, it said it was “committed to the well-being of our student-athletes and to ensuring that they have the best experience possible in and outside of competition.”
U.N.C. players either declined to comment or did not respond to messages. It was not clear which of the team’s players were represented when the relatives spoke with Cunningham and the other U.N.C. employees. No members of the coaching staff attended the meeting, which was organized after some players’ relatives held a conference call on March 25, the person said.
Smith said Thursday that the coach’s suggestion of the tomahawk chop, often seen at Florida State athletic events, was a motivational tool, and he said that Hatchell had often tried to commandeer the traditions of other schools to inspire her team.
The lawyer said that Hatchell had intended no offense in that episode and that she did not recall making any statements about “old mules.”
The person who described the allegations against Hatchell did not know of any specific accusations against the assistant coaches.
The North Carolina women’s basketball team has had great success under Hatchell, particularly in the 1990s and the 2000s. The Tar Heels won their sole national championship in 1994.
Hatchell, who recently completed her 33rd season at North Carolina, is one of a handful of college basketball coaches with more than 1,000 career wins, and she is a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. In her first college coaching job, Hatchell oversaw the junior varsity team at Tennessee in the team’s first season under Pat Summitt, a trailblazing head coach.
But in this decade, North Carolina has only twice reached the second weekend of the N.C.A.A. tournament, both times thanks to four players from its highly regarded recruiting class in 2013. After two seasons, all four players had transferred out of the program. This year, the team finished at 18-15.
Smith said on Thursday that, despite the allegations, he hoped Hatchell would be able to return to coaching at North Carolina.
“I want her to,” he said. “I believe this is a case in which things are not what they seem.”
On Thursday morning, Hatchell’s executive assistant sent an email to season-ticket holders. The season-end banquet had been postponed.
“Those who have paid for tickets will be refunded,” the email said. “When the banquet is rescheduled, we will contact you with more information.”

Good morning,
We’re covering the shake-up at
the Department of Homeland Security
,
the Israeli elections
on Tuesday and
the N.C.A.A. women’s basketball championship
.
Kirstjen Nielsen
stepped down on Sunday
after a rocky tenure in which she supported President Trump’s hard-line immigration policies even as he blamed her for the increased number of migrants illegally entering the U.S. (
Read her resignation letter
.)
After assuming the post in late 2017, Ms. Nielsen led the department during the administration’s “zero tolerance” policy along the Mexican border, which initially resulted in the separation of thousands of migrant children from their families.
What’s next:
Mr. Trump named Kevin McAleenan
, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, as acting secretary. In announcing a recent spike in the number of illegal border crossings, Mr. McAleenan said last month, “This is clearly both a border security and a humanitarian crisis.”
Catch up:
On Friday, Mr. Trump
withdrew his nominee to run Immigration and Customs Enforcement
, Ronald Vitiello, saying he wanted the agency to go in a “tougher” direction.
Fighting for survival before parliamentary elections, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu unexpectedly promised over the weekend to
begin extending sovereignty over the West Bank
if he is re-elected.
The West Bank is home to 2.6 million Palestinians, who view the area as the possible site of a future Palestinian state.
Mr. Netanyahu’s major rival, the former army chief Benny Gantz, and analysts dismissed the plan as a last-ditch effort to rally Mr. Netanyahu’s right-wing base.
Explainer:
Mr. Netanyahu is one of Israel’s longest-serving leaders, but he is facing his strongest challenge in years from Mr. Gantz and the leaders of a centrist alliance. Here’s
a guide to Tuesday’s voting
.
Antibiotics, which have been credited with saving tens of millions of lives, have never been more accessible to the poor, thanks largely to the mass production of generics in China and India. Across much of the developing world, a few dollars will buy drugs like amoxicillin, which treats a broad range of infections.
But the increasingly available drugs are
losing their ability to kill the germs they were designed to cure
. Poverty is a huge and largely unappreciated driver of antibiotic resistance, which is often viewed as a problem in rich countries.
“We are quickly running out of treatment options,” a researcher in Kenya said. “If we don’t get a handle on the problem, I fear for the future.”
Another angle:
A fungus called Candida auris preys on people with weakened immune systems, and
it is quietly spreading across the globe
. It adds a frightening new dimension to the threat posed by the overuse of antibiotics.
Jake Orta lives three blocks from Mark Zuckerberg’s $10 million home in San Francisco. A military veteran who now lives in government-subsidized housing, Mr. Orta is part of an underground economy, scavenging through others’ trash.
Mr. Orta sells what he retrieves around town and says his goal is to earn around $30 to $40 a day.
Our reporter, who followed Mr. Orta through the alleys of San Francisco, offers
a snapshot of the extremes of American capitalism
.
Quotable:
“You’ve got more and more tech people here and this city is moving faster and faster,” said a spokesman for a contractor that collects San Francisco’s garbage. “These people have short attention spans. Some discard items that ought to be repurposed.”
On a monthlong trip in Honduras, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and a photographer explored the rampant corruption and gang violence that is leading thousands of women to seek asylum in the U.S. Our Opinion section
published their collaboration
.
The country is one of the world’s deadliest for women, and the city above, Choloma, is one of the most dangerous. Domestic violence is common, and many women are killed by drug cartels and gangs, often in ways intended to spread terror.
Battle in Libya:
The U.S. military
evacuated its small contingent of troops
from the Libyan capital, Tripoli, as rival militias fought to stop an aspiring strongman from taking control of the city.
Internet regulation:
Britain
has proposed sweeping government powers
to fight the online spread of violent and extremist content, false information, and harmful material aimed at children. The plan announced today would be one of the most aggressive to rein in corrosive online content.
Democrats and the death penalty:
After California’s governor issued a moratorium on executions,
Democratic presidential candidates have embraced abolition
. It represents a generational shift for the party but follows a decades-long trend in declining public support for capital punishment.
Snapshot:
Above, Baylor
won its third N.C.A.A. women’s basketball championship
on Sunday, defeating Notre Dame, 82-81. Texas Tech and Virginia
play for the men’s title
tonight.
Theater review:
A revival of the 1943 musical “Oklahoma!” opened at the Circle in the Square Theater in Manhattan on Sunday.
Our critic calls it “the coolest new show on Broadway.”
What we’re reading:
This first-person piece in The Cut
. John Schwartz, a climate reporter, recommends it. “Lizzie O’Leary, one of my journalism heroes, recently resurfaced this 2017 essay about the sexual harassment she’s experienced,” he says. “I’m thinking maybe I should read it at least once a year, and maybe you should, too.”

Latin American ministers are descending today on Quito, Ecuador’s capital, to discuss Venezuela’s migration crisis.
The choice of location raises a question: When problems erupt in the region, is there a dominant city where they’re hammered out?
Not exactly.
The city with the largest population is Mexico City. The regional finance capital is Panama City. Brasília is the capital of Brazil, which has the continent’s biggest economy. Latin America’s exiles — from Cubans to the Venezuelans themselves — head north to Miami, where Spanish is often more common than English.
A peace agreement with Colombia’s rebels was hammered out in Havana, which has longstanding ties to both the rebels and the Colombian government.
While other parts of the world have centers of gravity — think of Beijing, Brussels and Washington — Latin America is still searching for its own.
Oh, what a beautiful mornin’
. Hope everything goes your way.
See you next time.

Good morning,
We’re covering a purge at
the Department of Homeland Security
, today’s
parliamentary elections in Israel
, and
the N.C.A.A. men’s basketball championship
.
Mr. Trump moved on Monday to
clear out the top ranks of the Department of Homeland Security
, a day after the resignation of its secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen.
The White House announced the departure of the director of the Secret Service, Randolph Alles, and more high-ranking officials are expected to leave soon.
The moves reflected the president’s frustration about immigration and security, and appeared to be a housecleaning of officials associated with John Kelly, the former White House chief of staff who was also Mr. Trump’s first Homeland Security secretary.
What’s next:
Mr. Trump’s push for tougher immigration policies
includes the possible return of a measure that separated migrant families, current and former officials said.
The Daily:
In
today’s episode
, a reporter who covers immigration for The Times discusses Ms. Nielsen’s tenure.
Another angle:
In clamping down on migrants, Mr. Trump has said “Our country is full.”
Demographers and economists disagree
.
The country heads into parliamentary elections today with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a veteran politician of the Israeli right, facing stiff competition from a centrist rival, Benny Gantz, a former army general.
Here’s a look at the voting process and what’s at stake
.
Mr. Netanyahu has overseen healthy economic growth, but charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust have loomed over his campaign. We’ll have live coverage as the polls close at 3 p.m. Eastern.
News analysis:
Mr. Netanyahu has promised to begin annexing parts of the West Bank, which would flout four decades of U.S. policy. He was emboldened by President Trump’s support,
our White House correspondent writes
.
Yesterday:
In another move that could help Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Trump designated a powerful arm of Iran’s military — the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps — as
a foreign terrorist organization
. It was the first time the U.S. has made such a declaration about part of another country’s government. Mr. Netanyahu and Trump administration officials have said Iran is the greatest threat facing Israel.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators in Sudan are demanding the departure of the country’s authoritarian ruler. Algeria’s longtime leader was forced out. And in Libya, an aging general is promising to end the chaos that followed the ouster of the dictator Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in 2011.
The uprisings across the Arab world eight years ago
are still reverberating across North Africa
, but the renewed unrest shows that the problems that led to the earlier uprisings remain. Those include growing populations of disaffected young people, closed and corrupt economies, and authoritarian governments unresponsive to the public.
What’s next:
President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt is to meet President Trump at the White House today. Mr. el-Sisi, 64, is seeking at least a tacit blessing before a referendum to change the Egyptian constitution so that he can stay in power until 2034 — in effect, as president for life.
Kelly Catlin, 23, won a silver medal in cycling at the 2016 Olympics and had a shot at gold at the 2020 Games. She was also a graduate student in computational mathematics at Stanford, setting up opportunities off the track.
That seemingly solid path made her downward spiral all the more mystifying to loved ones.
She was found dead in her apartment last month
.
Quotable:
Her father, Dr. Mark Catlin, blames several factors for her suicide, including a concussion in January. “I wake up every two to three hours at night to go through all of these permutations on what could have saved her,” he said. “I can’t help but wonder what she would’ve done with her life.”
The Boeing 737 Max jet that crashed twice in five months relied on decades-old systems and
left pilots without some common safety features
.
“It was state of the art at the time, but that was 50 years ago,” said a former engineer who helped design the Max’s cockpit. “It’s not a good airplane for the current environment.”
Attorney general in Congress:
William Barr is scheduled to testify today
and Wednesday to discuss the Justice Department budget. Some lawmakers are expected to question him over his handling of the special counsel’s report.
Saudis barred:
Sixteen Saudis, including a top aide to Prince Mohammed bin Salman,
will be denied entry to the U.S.
, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced Monday. The Trump administration has been criticized for playing down C.I.A. findings that show Prince Mohammed played a role in the killing of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi.
Mar-a-Lago arrest:
The Chinese woman who was arrested at President Trump’s Florida resort
had a device to detect hidden cameras
and $8,000 in a hotel room, a federal prosecutor has said.
College admissions scandal:
Fourteen people, including the actress Felicity Huffman,
will plead guilty
, prosecutors have said.
Fifty people were charged in the case, which involved faked test scores, phony athletic credentials and big payments.
The 2020 election:
And then there were 18. Representative Eric Swalwell of California
has joined the crowded field
of Democratic presidential candidates.
Keep track here
.
Storm threat in Midwest:
An unusually powerful storm this week
comes after one last month that resulted in widespread flooding in the region.
Convictions in Hong Kong protests:
Nine pro-democracy activists face prison terms of up to seven years
after being convicted today
for their roles in widespread protests in the city in 2014.
Snapshot:
Above, Virginia
won its first N.C.A.A. men’s basketball championship
on Monday, defeating Texas Tech, 85-77, in overtime. The game was the first in 40 years between men’s teams that had previously never played for the title.
Late-night comedy:
Jimmy Kimmel was among the hosts who
bid farewell to the departing Homeland Security secretary
: “Goodbye Kirstjen. Whoever replaces you permanently is going to have some very big cages to fill.”
What we’re reading:
This article in Popula
. Anna Holland, an editor based in London, recommends it, saying: “This is one of the best pieces on climate change I’ve read in a very long time. It asks tough questions of everyone — not just those on the hunt for a luxury apartment in Miami Beach.”
Cook:
Spicy sausage and butternut squash
are a perfect match. (Our

.
Lately,
leggings
have become a cultural lightning rod. But a
retrospective of the British designer Mary Quant
reminds us of an earlier fashion flash point: the miniskirt.
Ms. Quant, a trailblazer of Swinging Sixties fashion, famously said she “didn’t have time to wait for women’s lib.” Her higher-than-high hemlines insisted on young women’s right to bare their legs.
She named the skirt after her favorite car,
the original Mini Cooper
.
Pieces of clothing resembling miniskirts have been identified by archaeologists
as far back as the 1300s B.C.
, but it wasn’t until the mid-20th century that the mini took off. Staying true to the
Hemline Index
(whereby skirt hemlines rise with stock prices), the miniskirt perfectly captured 1960s London. The trend has followed a boom-and-bust cycle ever since.
Bans on short skirts are enforced in several African countries, however, and wearing a mini can prompt outrage — and even arrest — in parts of the Middle East.
That’s it for this briefing.
See you next time.

For Arike Ogunbowale, the trip to the top of the Empire State Building on Wednesday was unusually fast.
It had been arranged for her to bypass the lines and take express elevators to the observatory on the morning she was to become a professional basketball player. In the hours leading to the 2019 W.N.B.A. draft, these kinds of experiences did not faze Ogunbowale. Not after she had become one of the
most recognizable faces in college basketball
after hitting a pair of buzzer-beaters for Notre Dame in last year’s Final Four — one to slay Connecticut, the other to best Mississippi State and win the national championship.
“Nah, I’m used to life throwing new things at me now,” Ogunbowale said with a smile as she looked out over the New York skyline.
Even for the relentless Ogunbowale, the past week has brought a particular kind of whiplash.
On Wednesday night, the Dallas Wings selected her fifth in the draft, after the Las Vegas Aces took her college teammate Jackie Young with the top pick.
“You know, Dallas is a great place, and they have a great coach there, so I’m really excited,” Ogunbowale said, referring to Brian Agler, who has won the league title with teams in Seattle and Los Angeles. “I’m ready to get started.”
The draft followed her vintage set of performances in this season’s Final Four: 23 points in another win over Connecticut, and a game-high 31 points in the
national title game against Baylor
. Ogunbowale’s final shots came after a drive to the basket that yielded two free throws in the waning seconds, her team trailing by 2 points.
Then, the unthinkable: a miss. And a championship lost. Ogunbowale’s painful moment played out on the national stage, too, amplified in part by her previous success. Her mother, Yolanda, raced down from the stands after the game to reassure her, to say how proud she was.
“Over time, she’s going to realize that she won’t be defined by that moment,” Yolanda said Wednesday, hours before her daughter would hear her name called at the W.N.B.A. draft at Nike’s New York headquarters. “I was just hurting for her, and for her teammates, because they wanted it so bad.”
And there would be no time to process. A late Sunday night game turned into a Monday morning flight to South Bend, Ind., where Ogunbowale has one more class to complete at Notre Dame before she graduates.
Then it was onto New York, to see the realization of a professional dream that dates back to high school in Wisconsin, though first Ogunbowale had to choose basketball over soccer. (Oddly enough, Baylor recruited her for soccer.) She and her mother both say she could have gone pro in that, too. Confidence, backed up by results, runs in the family.
The path Ogunbowale chose has worked out pretty well. Over these last few days, her strength and her network of fans have fed off each other. Yolanda said Arike’s bubbly personality had drawn people into her orbit since she was a little girl.
Fans recognized her at the airport as she headed back to school, and some approached to cheer her up. People took notice, too, up on the Empire State Building observation deck. For Ogunbowale, it is becoming clearer that everyone still sees in her that dynamic personality, that same person who hit buzzer-beaters, who scored 55 in a high school game, who can count LeBron James and Kobe Bryant among her fans.
“Kobe, LeBron, all of them, they’ve missed some important shots in their lifetime,” Ogunbowale said. “It’s a part of the game, you know? I’m not going to be able to make every shot. So I’m glad about my career, and I think I had a great four years. Everybody’s been telling me that. I mean, that’s just one shot. But what you’ve done these four years for the program, for just women’s basketball in general, is big.”
How big? After the loss, Bryant reached out directly to encourage her. There seems to be something about Ogunbowale that make people root for her (unless they are part of the Connecticut faithful, that is).
And as her mother explained, Ogunbowale engenders a two-way connection, something of particular import for W.N.B.A. teams hoping to win both on the court and at the box office.
Liamani Segura, the 10-year-old girl who sang the national anthem at the title game, wanted a picture with Ogunbowale. Segura’s father worried Ogunbowale wouldn’t want to take one after such a difficult loss. But, as Segura’s father later told Yolanda, Arike approached Segura on her own for that photograph.
“So that’s the type of person she is,” Yolanda said of her daughter. “The person who, in the midst of that pain, she took her time to do that.”
And so while few expected Ogunbowale to be the first overall pick on Wednesday night, everyone wanted to hear from her, as she headed to Bleacher Report to talk about her favorite sneakers and to CBS for an on-camera interview, before getting down to the serious business of choosing a draft night outfit.
Erin Kane, Ogunbowale’s agent, had selected several options, and they headed to Express to see a stylist.
“You look great in a jumpsuit,” the stylist said as Ogunbowale settled on a sea-foam green one.
“Oh, I know,” Ogunbowale replied, ready for her close-up.

MINNEAPOLIS — Joshua Langford, a Michigan State guard, remembered the first time he saw more than an inch of snow. It was two years ago, during his freshman year in East Lansing. An Alabama native, he awoke one morning to find a campus absolutely covered in the stuff.
“Bro, they’re probably going to cancel class,” he told his roommate, the former Spartans star Miles Bridges.
Recalling his education in the winters of the Upper Midwest, he deadpanned this week: “They didn’t cancel class.”
These days, Langford remains one of the odd men out, a rare Michigan State player who did not grow up no more than a half-day’s drive from campus. In fact, 10 of the 16 players on the roster of this year’s Spartans, a No. 2 seed that faces third-seeded Texas Tech in a national semifinal on Saturday night, played high school basketball in the state of Michigan. Among its 12 players receiving scholarships, seven did.
With Langford out since January with a knee injury, the Spartans’ most recent two games — impressive wins over Louisiana State and Duke — have featured Michiganders playing more than 57 percent of the minutes.
“If we could have 13 guys from Michigan, that’s what Coach Izzo would like,” said Dwayne Stephens, Michigan State’s associate head coach.
Stephens is from Michigan, as are the other two assistants, the recruiting coordinator and Iron Mountain’s own Tom Izzo.
“In Michigan you don’t have all the publicity, all that type of thing,” said the star point guard Cassius Winston, a junior from Detroit. “You want to come to a place like Michigan State, where you’ve got to grind, you’ve got to work for everything.”
Yet in the age of national and international recruiting, the prominent men’s basketball team of a public university being dominated by players from its good-size state is more unusual than one might think.
Unlike football recruiting, which has remained somewhat regional, the best basketball teams these days draw players from everywhere. Thanks to summer leagues, the best players congregate in April and July showcases in a few cities near large airports in front of coaches from across the country. Even the 10 or 12 most prominent programs in the country — a classification that definitely includes Michigan State — sign only a combined few dozen players every year, so they can afford to chase after the best.
The in-state talent comprising 62.5 percent of the Michigan State roster, then, stands out.
At public-school programs similar in pedigree to Michigan State, this ratio tends to be much lower: 3 of 15 at Kansas; 1 of 12 at Kentucky (or two if you count the walk-on Brad Calipari, the coach’s son, who went to high school in New Jersey); 6 of 17 at North Carolina.
Nor is this some Big Ten occurrence. At Ohio State, the equivalent figure is 6 of 14. At Wisconsin, it’s 4 of 18. At Indiana, it’s 7 of 17.
In fact, of a semi-random assortment of 20 prominent state-school basketball teams, only Washington’s and Georgia’s had instate-to-out-of-state ratios similar to Michigan State’s. Only 6 of the 15 players on the Red Raiders roster Michigan State will face on Saturday are from Texas.
The trend is not new: For years, Michigan State’s biggest stars have almost all been Mitten Staters. Winston was Michigan’s Mr. Basketball at the University of Detroit Jesuit High School. Bridges, who was the 12th overall pick in the N.B.A. draft last year, is from Flint, though he played high school basketball in several states. Denzel Valentine is from Lansing, Draymond Green and Jason Richardson from Saginaw.
Dane Fife, another Michigan State associate head coach (and a former Michigan Mr. Basketball), is the son of a longtime high school coach in Clarkston. He said the kinship among players in the locker room (which also includes two Ohioans and one player from Indiana) has real competitive advantages. “There is a sense of loyalty not just to your school,” he said.
The biggest drawback to focusing on Michigan basketball in recruiting is the condition of Michigan basketball. It has seen better days.
For one thing, there are simply fewer people in Michigan than there used to be. The eighth-largest state by population in the 1990 census, it most likely will drop to 10th after next year’s, partly related to the travails of the auto industry. In the last five years, the best recruit from the state of Michigan was never ranked higher than No. 26 in 247Sports’s composite rankings.
Several Michigan State players and coaches said that another problem is Michigan High School Athletic Association rules limiting teams from traveling to national tournaments, causing an adverse impact on Michigan high school basketball and, indirectly, on Michigan State recruiting.
For instance, Detroit’s Josh Jackson, the top class of 2015 recruit nationally, played prep-school basketball elsewhere before his single season at Kansas.
“The M.H.S.A.A., the people that run the high school basketball, they have some old rules that definitely need to be updated,” said the freshman Foster Loyer, last year’s Michigan Mr. Basketball. “It is causing some higher-level talent to leave the state.”
Mark Uyl, the state association’s executive director, said in an interview that several states had similar travel rules, which in Michigan’s case allow teams to travel only to neighboring states (plus Illinois) or trips of no more than 300 miles in one direction.
“The 748 high schools that make up our membership believe that we found a pretty good balance of letting schools be able to travel to find some of the best competition in the Midwest, while keeping some academic balance,” Uyl said.
The Michigan State staff’s attitude toward the rules was pretty clear. “Hopefully,” Stephens said, “some things will change.”
Another potential obstacle to Michigan State’s ability to recruit in its own state has actually become an advantage. This is the presence of another public university, one located more proximately to the state population’s center of gravity and one that considers itself far more glamorous than its land-grant sibling.
It is possible you have heard of the University of Michigan, particularly if you have ever met anyone who went there.
But though Michigan has been to two national championship games since Michigan State last appeared in one, it is the Spartans — over the nearly quarter-century that Izzo has been Michigan State’s head coach — who have won a national title and made eight Final Fours, never going more than five seasons without playing in the N.C.A.A. tournament’s final weekend.
It may be the Wolverine State, but only seven of Michigan’s 16 players this season — and only four of its 12 scholarship players — were from Michigan.
To today’s teenagers, born several years after the Fab Five left Ann Arbor, Michigan’s dominant program is not the one in maize and blue.
“You grow up in Michigan,” said Braden Burke, a walk-on from Stevensville, “you want to play for Michigan State.”

Tennessee Tech announced Saturday that it has hired John Pelphrey as its basketball coach.
Pelphrey served on Alabama's coaching staff for the past three seasons. He was a former head coach at South Alabama (2002-07) and Arkansas (2007-11).
""It's an honor and privilege to be at Tennessee Tech,"" Pelphrey said in a school news release. ""My family and I, and our staff, were looking for a place where we could go and learn, lead and take on challenges in college basketball. We're very appreciative of (athletic director) Mark Wilson and his pursuit of us. We have complete confidence and trust in him.
""We love the alignment between him and President (Phil) Oldham and their vision for basketball at Tennessee Tech moving into the future, and we are very, very excited to be a part of that. We understand that there's a lot of work to do, but we're going to embrace that.""
Pelphrey, 50, replaces Steve Payne, who compiled a 118-134 in eight seasons. The Golden Eagles were just 8-23 this past season.
Pelphrey went 80-67 at South Alabama and made the NCAA Tournament in 2006 as his club finished 24-7. He went 20-12 the following season before departing for Arkansas.
The Razorbacks went 23-12 and made the NCAA Tournament in his first season (2007-08). But the team had losing campaigns the following two seasons and he went 69-59 in four seasons before being fired in March 2011.
Pelphrey played college basketball at Kentucky and averaged 11.0 points in 114 games (89 starts) over four seasons (1988-92).

North Carolina women's basketball coach Sylvia Hatchell is under investigation for allegedly making racist remarks and pressuring players to compete despite serious injuries, according to a report Thursday from the Washington Post.
The Hall of Fame coach allegedly told players they would be ""hanged from trees with nooses"" if they failed to improve, according to the newspaper, which cites interviews with seven people who have knowledge of the investigation. Six of those interviewed were parents of players on the team.
Hatchell's attorney, Wade Smith, denied the allegations during an interview with the Post.
""She said, 'They're going to take a rope and string us up, and hang us out to dry,'"" Smith said. ""There is not a racist bone in her body. ... A very high percentage of the people who have played for her and who love her are African-American women. She is a terrific coach and a truly world-class human being.""
North Carolina placed the longtime coach and the rest of her staff on paid leave on Monday as it investigated issues raised by players.
Hatchell released a statement on Monday, reading, in part: ""I love each and every one of the players I've coached and would do anything to encourage and support them. They are like family to me. I love them all. Of course, I will cooperate fully in this review. I look forward to a prompt conclusion of this matter and the continuation of our very successful women's basketball program.""
Hatchell has been the head coach at UNC since 1986 and has led the Tar Heels to three NCAA Final Four appearances -- 1994, 2006 and 2007 -- and the NCAA championship in 1994.
The program has made 23 appearances in the NCAA Tournament during her tenure. On March 23, the Tar Heels were eliminated by California in the first round of this year's tournament, 92-72.
Hatchell, 67, has a 751-325 record in 33 seasons at North Carolina. She missed one season -- 2013-14 -- as she battled leukemia. She spent the first 11 seasons of her career at Francis Marion College in South Carolina, finishing 272-80.
A 2013 enshrinee into the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame, she is the winningest women's basketball coach in Atlantic Coast Conference history.
Hatchell also is one of three active coaches in NCAA women's basketball with 1,000 wins -- Stanford's Trish VanDerveer and Connecticut's Geno Auriemma are the others -- and the only women's college basketball coach to win national championships at three levels: AIAW, NAIA and NCAA.

Arkansas has hired Eric Musselman to become its next basketball coach.
The 54-year-old Musselman, Nevada's coach since 2015, led the Wolf Pack to the NCAA Tournament in three of his four seasons at the Mountain West school. He previously was the head coach of the Golden State Warriors (2002-04) and Sacramento Kings (2006-07). His combined NBA record is 108-138.
""Eric Musselman is a coach that has had experience at every level of basketball from the NCAA to the NBA,"" Arkansas athletic director Hunter Yurachek said in a statement Sunday.
""He was practically born into the game and his passion for basketball is unmistakable. He has been successful throughout his career, including the remarkable job he did in returning the University of Nevada into a perennial NCAA Tournament team. Coach Musselman is high-energy and possesses an extremely high basketball IQ. He has a great attention to detail and has structured his programs to develop players individually while building a successful team.""
Musselman's record at Nevada was 110-34 overall and 54-18 in the Mountain West.
In his first season, 2015-16, he led a team that won nine games the previous season to the CBI Tournament title, followed by the three NCAA Tournament runs.
He took the Wolf Pack to the Sweet 16 in 2018, where they lost to tournament darling Loyola-Chicago, 69-68.
This season, the Wolf Pack were ranked as high as No. 5 in the AP Top 25 and finished 29-5 (15-3 MW). Their season ended March 21 in the first round of the NCAA Tournament when the seventh-seeded Wolf Pack lost to No. 10 seed Florida, 70-61.
Arkansas last month fired Mike Anderson, who was 169-102 in eight seasons with three NCAA Tournament appearances. The Razorbacks went 18-16 this season.

MINNEAPOLIS — Texas Tech coach Chris Beard was named college basketball Coach of the Year on Thursday.
Texas Tech has a school-record 30 wins entering Saturday's national semi-final against Michigan State.
""I just want to thank the game of basketball for everything it does for people. It changes lives, and it's just a special thing. Especially college basketball. When executed correctly, it can just change lives,"" Beard said Thursday. ""None of us are here today without basketball.""
Beard was an assistant coach and associate head coach at Texas Tech from 2001-11 and worked his way through small-college ranks -- first at McMurry University in Abilene, Texas -- as a head coach.
""Most importantly, this is an award that we won this year,"" Beard said. ""I was having the same conversation with Jarrett Culver just a couple of weeks ago in my office when he won Big 12 Player of the Year, and Culver and I shared the view that any award you get in athletics in a team sport is team based.
""So I really share this award with everybody, not only on this year's team, but every Texas Tech team we've had as we built this.
""I just really want to thank the players. It's so cool when we're here and we get the award and you guys are here. I don't know what I possibly could have what John Wooden and Bob Knight and Coach Izzo didn't have, but I don't think they had their team 30 minutes removed from practice sitting on the front row when we got the award. This is special. I want to thank each player that played on this year's team. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you guys.""
The AP award founded in 1967 went three times to Beard's mentor, Knight, but Beard is the first coach at a Texas university to win the trophy.

CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. — A Virginia city once marred by Tiki torches, Nazi chants and deadly violence is savoring a united moment of bliss as it welcomes home the national champion University of Virginia men's basketball team.
Charlottesville was in full party mood Tuesday, a day after the Cavaliers defeated Texas Tech in the title game in Minneapolis. Supporters flocked to the school's basketball arena to welcome the team home.
The ebullient mood was a marked departure from nearly two years ago, when a white nationalist rally descended into violence and chaos and left one woman dead.
The city also has been rocked in recent years by the high-profile slayings of female students and a bogus magazine story about a gang rape at the university.

MINNEAPOLIS — Duke freshman Zion Williamson won the Oscar Robertson Trophy, presented to the 2018-19 U.S. Basketball Writers Association player of the year.
Williamson is the eighth Blue Devil to win the trophy and the third freshman (Kentucky's Anthony Davis, Texas' Kevin Durant) to claim the honor.
Robertson presented Williamson the bronze trophy, which portrays Robertson's likeness, Friday at U.S. Bank Stadium in a press conference with Joe Mitch of the USBWA. Williamson was also presented with the AP national player of the year in another ceremony after receiving 59 of a possible 64 first-place votes.
""There are so many other great players across the country that could have won this award,"" Williamson said. ""This award, I see it as a team award. Without them I wouldn't be here. I would really like to thank my mom for pushing me after every practice, every game.""
Robertson said Williamson's footwork caught his attention watching him play this season.
Williamson, who was also a unanimous selection to the 2019 college basketball All-America team on Tuesday, averaged 22.6 points, 8.9 rebounds, 2.1 assists and 1.8 blocks per game.
""Talking to Zion in the back, I congratulated him for having such a great year,"" Robertson said. ""But your best basketball is all in front of you. It's just exciting for me to sit beside you. You are so humble about the award and this is great. ... I hope you go to the right team. You're going to be a tremendous star in the NBA.""
Williamson is projected as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2019 NBA Draft. He laughed off suggestions that he wouldn't play for certain NBA teams after an April 1 report from ESPN hinted he wouldn't play for the Knicks.
Williamson said he plans to enjoy college and will discuss his next step with his family.
Williamson is the seventh Duke player to win AP player of the year honors. He is the third freshman to claim the AP award, with Davis and Durant again being the other two.

MINNEAPOLIS — Much like his vagabond coach, Texas Tech's Matt Mooney has undergone a college basketball journey unlike almost any other, from mid-major to out-of-the-way outpost to the rough-and-tumble Big 12.
Now, under the searing spotlight of the Final Four, Mooney has been simply money.
The self-described ""short, skinny"" kid nobody but the Air Force Academy wanted, who starred for two years at South Dakota before transferring to the wind-swept West Texas plains, etched his name in Red Raiders lore Saturday night with a virtuoso performance in the national semifinals.
Mooney poured in 22 points, including a spurt of three 3-pointers in a 2 1/2-minute second-half barrage, sending Texas Tech to a 61-51 victory over Michigan State and into a title tilt with Virginia.
""I'm happy for Matt, man. This is what we came here for,"" said Tariq Owens, himself a transplant from St. John's. ""He had the biggest game of his career on the biggest stage.""
Yet the road was long and winding, filled with crisis and controversy, doubt and despair.
Mooney grew up in the small Chicago suburb of Wauconda, Illinois, and fell in love with the game at an early age. By the time he reached high school, he'd make a 90-minute trek to Notre Dame College Prep to play under longtime NBA player Jim Les rather than attending the local high school.
Mooney figured it would best prepare him for college, yet few coaches seemed to notice — they were probably too busy watching nearby Simeon Career Academy and the jewel of the 2013 class, Jabari Parker, who would star at Duke before becoming the No. 2 overall pick in the draft.
The only Division I scholarship offer Mooney received came from Air Force, and he swallowed the idea of a five-year commitment to the military for the chance to play high-level hoops.
Things went fairly well on the court, too. Mooney averaged 6.9 points as a freshman, sharpened his game and proved to a whole lot of doubters he could cut it in Division I basketball.
Off the court was another matter.
Mooney had trouble adjusting to the rigidity of military life, and he loathed the harsh way the upperclassmen set the tone. He ultimately decided to transfer, and later caused a stir when he accused the academy of promoting a culture of ""bullying"" that left him feeling depressed.
The academy disputed his claim, and Mooney has since apologized for the accusation. But it didn't change the fact that he needed a fresh start, which Mooney found at lower-rung South Dakota.
For two seasons, he averaged 20 points a game and led the Coyotes to a pile of wins.
But they never reached the NCAA Tournament, always a step behind mid-major star Mike Daum and rival South Dakota State. So when Mooney realized he would graduate last May, he once again began looking at transfer options. He settled on an unlikely fit in Texas Tech, the kid who'd chafed at authority making the decision to play for a program whose pillars are structure and defense.
Then again, maybe he chose Chris Beard as much as he chose Texas Tech.
The Red Raiders coach has been on an odyssey of his own, cutting his teeth at junior colleges in Kansas and Florida, low-level schools McMurray and Angelo State, even the semi-pro ABA, before and he got his big break at Arkansas-Little Rock and parlayed one year of success into the Texas Tech gig.
Turns out Mooney and Beard were a match made from basketball morass.
""This guy just loved the game,"" said Beard, who fondly recalled visiting Mooney's bachelor pad apartment with its sagging couch and his inquisitive roommates while trying to lure him away from chilly Vermillion, South Dakota. ""This guy just loved basketball like I do.""
Now, the kid nobody wanted and the coach nobody gave anything to have embraced the chance of a lifetime. After winning a share of the regular-season Big 12 title, they have marched their way through the NCAA Tournament, dispatching Michigan State in the semifinals with cold, cruel efficiency.
It was Mooney that had to lead the way.
With star forward Jarrett Culver struggling and Owens hobbling toward the locker room, Mooney began to rain down 3-pointers. On defense, he locked up Spartans point guard Cassius Winston, forcing the Big Ten player of the year into his worst game of the season.
""When he gets in that zone,"" Culver said, ""it's hard to stop him.""
Yes, the Red Raiders triumphed because he was in the zone. Will he still be Monday night? Virginia boasts one of the nation's top defenses, and shutdown guards Ty Jerome and Kyle Guy will likely share the challenge of stopping him. And any chance Mooney had of getting overlooked is long gone.
Regardless of what happens, though, he promises to enjoy one last night under the lights.
The final stop on a memorable voyage through college basketball.
""I always thought I could play at this level,"" Mooney said before one last practice Sunday. ""So what I would say to everyone is, 'Chase your dreams. Pursue your dreams.' I never thought I'd be in this situation. I've had so many people along the way who have helped me out.""

MINNEAPOLIS — The Latest on the Final Four of the NCAA Tournament (all times local):
4:30 p.m.
The betting public is split on Virginia and Auburn in the first game of the Final Four.
Betting data released by William Hill US on Saturday night shows more wagers are being placed on Auburn on spread and money line bets, but more money for both wagers is backing Virginia.
That difference shows a split between sharp bettors gambling more money per bet and a higher number of casual bettors who wager less.
The difference is especially stark on the money line, which is minus-300 for Virginia, meaning a gambler would need to bet $300 to win $100. William Hill says 77% of wagers are backing Auburn, where a $100 bet can win $250 if the Tigers win the game outright. Still, 72% of the money is favoring Virginia to win straight up.
The money line bet between Texas Tech and Michigan State is seeing a similar divide, with sharp bettors heavily backing the Spartans (92 and more tickets on Texas Tech (58%).

4:25 p.m.
No surprises in the starting lineups for Virginia and Auburn in the first national semifinal.
The Tigers are going with their usual backcourt in Jared Harper and Bryce Brown, while their trio of forwards will be Horace Spencer, Malik Dunbar and Anfernee McLemore.
It's been McLemore and sixth man Danjel Purifoy who have picked up the minutes in place of forward Chuma Okeke, who tore the ACL in his left knee late in a regional semifinal win over North Carolina.
Virginia is going with freshman Kihei Clark and juniors Kyle Guy and Ty Jerome in the backcourt, and De'Andre Hunter and Mamadi Diakite provide some length and ability to guard down low.

Intriguing hire or incredible troll job?
The Washington Post, citing unnamed sources, reported Saturday that Virginia Tech was on the verge of hiring UMBC's Ryan Odom as its next coach. That would be the same UMBC that became the first 16-seed to beat a No. 1 when it knocked Virginia out of the tournament a year ago.
It could also be just a ruse, though. The Baltimore Sun received a text message from Odom saying of the rumor, ""Nothing to it."" The newspaper also reported that two anonymous sources said the 44-year-old Odom —a longtime Virginia Tech assistant under Seth Greenberg — isn't going anywhere.
Meanwhile in Minneapolis, the Hokies' hated rivals were warming up for their Final Four matchup with Auburn.

The NCAA will honor late AP Basketball Writer Jim O'Connell at the Final Four in Minneapolis by leaving a courtside seat open for him this weekend. O'Connell covered 39 consecutive Final Fours from 1979-2017 for AP and was one of the most knowledgeable and well-known people covering college basketball. He died in July at 64 after fighting a series of ailments in recent years.
O'Connell, known as Oc to everyone who knew him, was a member of the U.S. Basketball Writers Association Hall of Fame and he received the Curt Gowdy Award from the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Before Virginia plays Auburn in the first national semifinal Saturday, a video tribute to O'Connell will be shown in U.S. Bank Stadium.

Virginia, the only No. 1 seed left in the bracket, is in Minneapolis to make a new kind of history after its momentous first-round fail against No. 16 seed UMBC a year ago.
The Cavaliers and their impenetrable pack-line defense will try to stop the volume-shooting Auburn Tigers, who have poured in 3-pointers during this NCAA Tournament like they're playing pop-a-shot.

Dwyane Wade scored 30 points in a tribute-filled final home game on Tuesday, but despite a 122-99 victory over Philadelphia, the Miami Heat were eliminated from playoff contention.
Wade’s career will end Wednesday in Brooklyn. He checked out with 1:02 left, embracing teammates and his son, Zaire.
Wade scored the first basket of the game on a dunk, Philadelphia scored the next eight — and it was all Miami the rest of the way.
In the final minutes, Wade swished a 3-pointer and banked in two more en route to 14 points in the final quarter.
MAVERICKS 120, SUNS 109
Dirk Nowitzki scored a season-high 30 points in what was most likely the final home game of the 40-year-old’s 21st season.
The 14-time All-Star scored the team’s first 10 points and passed his previous season high of 21 on a 3-pointer early in the third quarter. The Mavericks end their season Wednesday in San Antonio.
Jamal Crawford scored 51 points for Phoenix (19-63), which had by far the worst record in the Western Conference.
Fans stood during warm-ups, recording Nowitzki in the layup line on their phones. The 7-foot German obliged with a dunk. Then he had another dunk in the game — his second of the season — in the second half.
Nowitzki fought back tears during a tribute video in between the first and second quarters.
KNICKS 96, BULLS 86
Dennis Smith Jr. scored 25 points, Mitchell Robinson added eight points and 17 rebounds and the Knicks escaped the possibility of finishing with the worst record in franchise history.
With one game remaining, against Detroit, the Knicks (17-64) can only tie the mark of the 2014-15 team. They already secured the N.B.A.’s worst record and a draft position no worse than fifth.
The Bulls, meanwhile, lost for the 32nd time at United Center this season, a franchise record.
PISTONS 100, GRIZZLIES 93
Andre Drummond had 20 points and 17 rebounds, as host Detroit came back from a 22-point deficit to cling to a playoff spot.
Detroit can clinch a bid Wednesday night at New York.
HORNETS 124, CAVALIERS 97
Kemba Walker scored 23 points and visiting Charlotte kept its playoff push alive. The Hornets (39-42) must now beat Orlando at home on Wednesday and hope the Pistons (39-42) lose in New York.
WARRIORS 112, PELICANS 103
DeMarcus Cousins had 21 points and 12 rebounds for visiting Golden State, which took Stephen Curry out of the game after nine minutes with a mild foot sprain.
The Warriors said Curry was held out as a precaution, having already had clinched the top playoff seed in the Western Conference. They also played without Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson.
The game also likely marked the end of the Anthony Davis era in New Orleans. The disgruntled All-Star, who missed his seventh straight game with what the team has officially listed as back spasms, wore a T-shirt that said, “That’s All Folks.”
CELTICS 116, WIZARDS 110

N.B.A. Roundup
By
The Associated Press
The Nets were all business on Sunday. They started fast. They closed hard. And they refused to let anything, even a frequent nemesis, block their playoff path.
Instead, the Nets beat Indiana at its own physical game and earned their first playoff berth in four years with a 108-96 victory on the road — though the muted locker room celebration made it hard to tell if players were more relieved or excited that the drought was over.
“It means a lot, obviously to exceed expectations for a lot of us in here, to see how far we’ve come,” Joe Harris said after scoring 18 of his 19 points in the decisive first half. “It means a ton. Hopefully, it’s a sign of things to come for this organization.”
After starting the season 8-18, the Nets (41-40) fought back to clinch their first nonlosing record in four years and can make it a winning season by beating Miami in Wednesday’s regular-season finale. They have the same record as Orlando; the Nets will finish sixth and the Magic seventh with a win or an Orlando loss. The Nets will be no worse than seventh.
“There was another level of focus, another level of being locked in,” Nets Coach Kenny Atkinson said. “They wanted it so bad, there was an extra energy there in these past few games.”
The Nets, who got 20 points from D’Angelo Russell and 18 from Caris LeVert, ended a nine-game losing streak against the Pacers and a seven-game losing streak in Indianapolis that dated to March 2015.
Domantas Sabonis had 17 points and 12 rebounds for Indiana, which has lost two straight at home and five of seven over all, locking the Pacers into the No. 5 seed in the East.
“They were playing for something and they went out and showed it,” the Pacers’ Myles Turner said of the Nets.
KNICKS 113, WIZARDS 110
Mario Hezonja scored a career-high 30 points and made the go-ahead 3-pointer with 44 seconds left, and the Knicks beat Washington at Madison Square Garden for the first time in nine games over six years.
Luke Kornet added 17 points and Kevin Knox had 16 for the Knicks (16-64), who would have tied the franchise record for losses had they not rallied from a 10-point deficit after three quarters.
“There’s no quitters in this locker room, in this organization, and we’re just showing we have a great chemistry going around and it resulted in a win,” Hezonja said. “So we’re not paying attention to standings or whatever it is. We just treat it as a development year and hopefully it results in something big next year.”
The Knicks have to win their last two games to avoid at least matching their 17-65 record under Derek Fisher in 2014-15.
HORNETS 104, PISTONS 91
Kemba Walker scored 20 of his 31 points in the first half to help Charlotte win at Detroit.
The Hornets won their third in a row to keep their East playoff hopes alive. Charlotte and Miami are tied for ninth, a game behind Detroit. All three teams have two games left.
RAPTORS 117, HEAT 109
Pascal Siakam had 23 points and 10 rebounds, Kawhi Leonard scored 22 points, and host Toronto won in overtime, further denting Miami’s fading playoff hopes.
MAGIC 116, CELTICS 108
Terrence Ross had 26 points, Nikola Vucevic added 25 points and 12 rebounds, and Orlando rallied at Boston to clinch its first playoff berth in seven years.
WARRIORS 131, CLIPPERS 104
Stephen Curry scored 27 points as Golden State clinched the Western Conference’s top seed, beating Los Angeles in the Warriors’ final regular-season game at Oracle Arena.
3-POINTER RECORD
James Harden scored 30 points in just three quarters as the Houston Rockets broke their N.B.A. record by making 27 3-pointers in a 149-113 home win against Phoenix. Eric Gordon led the way with eight 3-pointers, and Harden had five.

MILWAUKEE — Jared Dudley brought a veteran’s presence and poise to a tense situation, helping the Nets to a crucial victory in their bid for the playoffs.
Dudley’s offensive rebound set up Joe Harris’s go-ahead 3-pointer with 1 minute 24 seconds left in a 133-128 victory against the short-handed Milwaukee Bucks on Saturday.
The Nets, who had dropped four of five, moved into a sixth-place tie in the Eastern Conference with Orlando; each team is 40-40. Detroit is a half-game back with a 39-40 record. The Nets have tiebreakers over the Magic and the Pistons. The Nets are ahead of ninth-place Miami by one and a half games.
The Nets made 19 3-pointers and placed eight players in double figures. D’Angelo Russell had 25 points and 10 assists, the reserve Caris LeVert scored 24 points, and Dudley had 14 of his 16 points in the second half.
Milwaukee was playing without the superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo, who was sidelined by a left calf injury.
“It was tough, even without Giannis,” Dudley said, adding, “We just got key stops at the very end.”
Nets Coach Kenny Atkinson called Dudley “the X factor” and said that his instincts had contributed to the Nets’ first win in four meetings with Milwaukee this season.
Eric Bledsoe had 33 points and 11 assists for the Bucks, and Khris Middleton finished with 24 points.
Bledsoe’s two foul shots gave Milwaukee a 128-126 lead with 2:30 left, but the Nets closed the game with a 7-0 run. Russell made two free throws, Harris drilled his tiebreaking 3-pointer, and Russell drove for a basket with 59.1 seconds left.
“It was a room-and-rhythm look,” Harris said of his go-ahead shot.

MINNEAPOLIS — For Virginia and Texas Tech, doing something that had never been done before took hard work, dedication, determination — and vision.
The Cavaliers and Red Raiders meet in the NCAA Tournament championship game Monday night. Neither program has ever been this close to a title, making it a rare matchup of first-timers to the final game of the college basketball season. The last time both teams in the championship game had never been there before was 40 years ago, when Magic Johnson and Michigan State beat Larry Bird and Indiana State.
Between the Red Raiders (31-6) and Cavaliers (34-3), a first-time champ is guaranteed. The last one of those was crowned in 2006, when Florida won the first of back-to-back titles.
College basketball's hierarchy, blue bloods in an array of shades from Duke to Kentucky, North Carolina to Kansas, is difficult to crack. Getting here started with Virginia coach Tony Bennett and Texas Tech's Chris Beard believing it could be done.
""Then you've got to get people on board that really believe it and believe it in front of you, behind your back, believe it at 10 o'clock when they're out of town, on the road somewhere. Believe it in the morning, believe it when they're talking to their wife, their kid,"" Beard said Sunday at U.S. Bank Stadium. ""They've got to really believe it.""
In less than a decade, Beard has gone from coaching in the semi-pro ABA to Division III, then II, and then a couple of seasons at Arkansas Little Rock before landing in Lubbock. The Red Raiders basketball history is solid but unspectacular. Texas Tech was where Bobby Knight landed after the volatile Hall of Fame coach wore out his welcome in Indiana. He took Texas Tech to the NCAA Tournament four times in the 2000s. Pretty good, but Beard expected much more.
""Our goal has never been to make a tournament. It's been to win the tournament,"" Beard said. ""It's easy to talk about, and really, really hard to do. But that's where we started this whole thing, was just trying to have the expectations and the vision where we could be relative.""
Texas Tech reached the Elite Eight for the first time last season. This season, with a mostly rebuilt team around star Jarrett Culver, the Red Raiders shared the Big 12 regular-season title for the first time and are now on the cusp of an unlikely championship.
Bennett's belief he could challenge the Atlantic Coast Conference's Tobacco Road powers came from his father, Dick Bennett. The Badgers hadn't been to a Final Four in more than 50 years, when Dick Bennett coached them there in 2000 using a methodical style.
""Can you go and take a team and build your program in a way that you think is best and compete against the best?"" said Bennett, in his 10th season at Virginia. ""There's a way that I know works -- or that I believe works. So when you get in those spots, you hope, you have a vision and you hope, but you never truly know. When you come in and say, 'This is going to happen. We're going to be a Final Four team, or we're going to win the ACC.' You believe it, and you hope it, and then you just go to work.""
Tony Bennett took his father's blueprint and turned Virginia into a perennial ACC contender, going toe-to-toe with Duke and North Carolina, but not until this season were the Cavaliers able to break through — doing so on the strength of two improbable last-second plays. And just a year after suffering the most stunning upset in NCAA Tournament history, losing as the top overall seed to No. 16 seed UMBC.
Defense is the calling card for both the Cavaliers and Red Raiders, but Bennett is quick to point out, they are not similar when it comes to X's and O's, only results. By KenPom's points allowed per 100 possessions, Texas Tech is ranked No. 1 in the country and Virginia is fifth. The betting total for this game was paltry 118 on Sunday.
Maybe they're making defense cool again.
""I would like to think so,"" Tech's Brandone Francis said. ""It's like I love eating ice cream, no different than playing defense.""
This NCAA championship game might not lure in the casual fan, looking for one-and-done stars, iconic coaches and fast-paced 3-balling offenses like the ones Villanova used to win two of the last three titles.
""I think if you're a basketball fan you'll really enjoy the game,"" Virginia's Braxton Key said. ""If you're just kind of a highlight fan this isn't the game to watch.""

James Harden had 26 points, 8 assists and 8 rebounds in just 29 minutes to lead the host Houston Rockets to a 120-96 win against the Knicks on Friday night.
For Harden, it was not nearly as spectacular as his last game against the Knicks when he tied a career high by scoring 61 points in a 114-110 win at Madison Square Garden on Jan. 23. Harden entered Friday averaging 43 points in his last three games against the Knicks.
With the game largely in hand early, Harden played less than 30 minutes for just the sixth time this season. He entered Friday night second in the league with 37.0 minutes a game.
Houston (52-28) kept the heat on Denver in the battle for the second seed in the Western Conference. The Rockets have two games remaining in the regular season; they host Phoenix on Sunday and visit Oklahoma City on Tuesday.
When asked if he pays close attention to the playoff standings, Chris Paul shook his head.
“Just hooping and worrying about us,” said Paul, who had 11 points and 10 assists.
With Knicks point guard Emmanuel Mudiay sidelined with a sore left shoulder, Mario Hezonja started, posting 16 points, 16 rebounds and 11 assists. Hezonja’s triple-double was the first for the Knicks since Jan. 11, 2018, when Jarrett Jack had one against Atlanta.
Knicks Coach David Fizdale said of Hezonja, “He did a great job, he organized us, he called the right stuff, he attacked when he needed to attack and did an excellent job on the glass.”
The Knicks were also without Kadeem Allen (concussion), Isaiah Hicks (sore left hip), Dennis Smith Jr. (sore lower back), Allonzo Trier (strained left calf) and Noah Vonleh (sprained right ankle). DeAndre Jordan did not play for a fourth straight game (coach’s decision).
Henry Ellenson had 16 points off the bench for the Knicks, who lost their ninth straight on the road and their eighth of nine over all.
The Rockets held the Knicks to 16 points in the first quarter, a season low for opponents’ first-quarter scoring against Houston. The Rockets led, 32-16, after the first quarter and held a 72-43 lead at halftime.
Winning for the seventh time in their last eight games, the Rockets swept the season series against the Knicks for the 12th time in 14 seasons.
MAGIC PASS NETS
Host Orlando had a team-record 81 points in the first half on its way to a 149-113 win against Atlanta that moved the Magic past the Nets and Detroit into sixth place in the Eastern Conference.
Nikola Vucevic, Terrence Ross and Evan Fournier scored 25 points each for Orlando, which set a season high for points despite having 19 turnovers. The Magic, trying to make the playoffs for the first time in seven years, broke a tie with the idle Nets and passed the Pistons, who lost to Oklahoma City, 123-110. Orlando is at 40-40; the Nets and Detroit hold the final two spots at 39-40 each.
Miami (38-41) failed to create a three-way tie for the last two berths, losing by 111-109 at Minnesota. Orlando has two games left, one less than the other three contenders.

The UCLA men's basketball program was unable to land yet another highly regarded candidate for its vacant head coaching position when Tennessee's Rick Barnes elected Monday to remain with the Volunteers.
Tennessee athletic director Phillip Fulmer released a statement during Monday night's NCAA men's championship game between Virginia and Texas Tech, saying Barnes decided to stay in Knoxville.
""One of the nation's most tradition-rich college basketball programs identified what we here at Tennessee already knew -- that Rick Barnes is one the game's elite coaches and a program-changer,"" Fulmer's statement read, in part. ""I'm thrilled that he will remain a part of our Tennessee Athletics family.""
The Volunteers were 31-6 under Barnes this season, reaching a No. 1 ranking and advancing to the South Regional semifinals, where they were defeated 99-94 by Purdue. Barnes was selected the Naismith Coach of the Year on Sunday.
UCLA also had interest in Texas Christian's Jamie Dixon, but the school elected to pursue other options last week after reportedly electing to not pay the $8 million buyout of his contract. It is unclear if UCLA will resume its pursuit of Dixon.
The Bruins' program is in need of a head coach after Steve Alford was fired on New Year's Eve. The Bruins started 7-6 under Alford and finished with a 17-16 record, with Murry Bartow taking over on an interim basis. UCLA did not advance to the NCAA Tournament for the second time in four years.
Other reported coaching candidates of interest to UCLA include Mick Cronin of Cincinnati, Randy Bennett of Saint Mary's, and former Bruins point guard Earl Watson, who was fired as head coach of the Phoenix Suns three games into the 2017-18 season.

MINNEAPOLIS — The Circle 6 Ranch sits halfway between Stanton and Lenorah, just off a stretch of Highway 137 in West Texas where the tumbleweeds have free rein. Parker Hicks, a sophomore on the Texas Tech basketball team, had another description for its location: “It’s in the middle of nowhere.”
The final chapter of the Texas Tech basketball team’s season will be written on Monday night, when the Red Raiders play Virginia in the N.C.A.A. men’s national championship game. But the opening one was set at the Circle 6, a broad spread on a dusty plain, over a long weekend in early September.
Back then, the Red Raiders were in many ways a group of players and coaches who hardly knew one another. Several of the team’s key players were new. So were a few members of the coaching and support staffs. The trip is where they laid the groundwork for what they have become.
“The whole point of the retreat was to really get to know each other a little bit better,” said guard Matt Mooney, a graduate transfer who scored 22 points in Saturday night’s win over Michigan State at the Final Four. “Oftentimes it’s hard to really trust each other and play for each other and play for the coaches if you don’t really know them.”
So the team bussed about 15 miles to the nearest high school gym for the year’s first practices, but it also sang karaoke, hung out by a bonfire, and walked along ledges buoyed only by the trust of a teammate. Everyone took part: players, coaches, managers, staff members.
One of the first exercises called for everyone’s name to be put in a hat, and then one by one each scrap of paper was pulled out to form pairs. Those tandems went walking around the ranch, getting to know one another.
Noah Parker, a freshman manager, learned that the wife of Tim McAllister, who was hired last summer as the team’s chief of staff, is a college rifle coach. Josh Mballa, a freshman who was born in Detroit and raised in Bordeaux, France, learned that the graduate assistant Gino Saucedo’s dad had a similar experience, coming from Mexico as a kid. The new assistant coach Glenn Cyprien learned that the mother of one of the team’s managers was battling cancer.
These types of exercises are not unique to Texas Tech; Virginia’s players had a hoot on a white-water rafting trip. (At least all of them except De’Andre Hunter, who can’t swim.) And Texas Tech’s players hollered when they visited Upper Manhattan’s Rucker Park in December and the team’s graduate assistants played impromptu pickup games.
For the Red Raiders, though, the bonhomie engineered at the ranch and cultivated ever since has been essential.
Last year’s team had lost five seniors and Zhaire Smith, a freshman who turned pro and was selected in the first round of the N.B.A. draft, from a team that reached the N.C.A.A. tournament’s East Region final. Texas Tech is not Kentucky or Duke; its coaches knew they could not restock the roster with new plug-and-play lottery picks. So Coach Chris Beard brought in two graduate transfers — Mooney, who played at Air Force and South Dakota, and Tariq Owens, who played at Tennessee and St. John’s — along with four freshmen and a junior college transfer. He also had new coaches, like Cyprien, and staff members, like McAllister, who would need to be integrated.
It was hard, then, to argue with Texas Tech’s being pegged for seventh place in the Big 12 in a preseason vote.
But Beard knows what it is like to build on the fly.
He has coached at junior colleges, Division II and Division III programs, and spent a year in the semiprofessional American Basketball Association and a summer coaching Switzerland’s national team. In his one year at Arkansas-Little Rock, Beard took a team with 10 new players to the second round of the N.C.A.A. tournament.
And so, fighting the clock to forge relationships, Beard regularly ate lunch and checked in last summer with Mooney and Owens, knowing how important the former, a scoring point guard, and the latter, a shot blocking forward, would be to his team.
“It’s not arrogance, it’s just the truth: we’re really good at coaching one-year guys,” Beard said. He added: “My experience in professional basketball, the rosters always change — guys come in on contract and just leave. I think there’s an art to it.”
The court, then, is a canvas.
Watch Texas Tech play defense, with its persistent switching on screens, and its disciplined funneling of dribblers toward the baseline. Trust is essential. And on offense, with its high volume of motion sets — the ones plucked from the playbook of his one-time boss in an earlier stint at Texas Tech, Bobby Knight — all five players are moving and reading one another with no predictable path for the ball. Communication is critical.
The transition has not always been seamless.
In mid-January, the Red Raiders lost three consecutive games. After a couple of wins, they were routed at Kansas and what had started as a promising season was turning sideways. Mooney and the redshirt senior Norense Odiase invited the players to their apartment, letting people get things off their chests and reminding everyone that there was still time to accomplish what they wanted this season, time to become a team that left enduring memories.
They lost only once after the meeting, and most recently rolled past second-seeded Michigan, thwarted top-seeded Gonzaga and staved off Michigan State, another No. 2 seed.
On Monday, they arrived in the championship game, an unforeseen occurrence for a team that until last season had never reached a regional final. That Texas Tech could have an extra challenge against Virginia if Owens, who injured his ankle on Saturday night, is unable to play or be effective, almost seems beside the point.
The Red Raiders will lean on each other for another 40 minutes. They will trust a bond whose roots were laid at a West Texas ranch — a fitting place to start a journey that seems to have come out of nowhere.

The N.C.A.A. final will tip off about 9:20 p.m. Eastern on Monday in Minneapolis, the culmination of the men’s college basketball season.
How can I watch?
The game will be broadcast by CBS. A stream is available
here
.
Who’s playing?
Virginia (34-3) and Texas Tech (31-6).
That’s unexpected. Have they been here before?
No. Neither team has played in the title game before this year. Virginia was last in the Final Four in 1984; Texas Tech had never previously advanced past the last eight.
Wait, what happened to Duke?
The consensus best team in the college game this season, one stocked with future N.B.A. lottery picks like
Zion Williamson
and RJ Barrett, Duke lost to Michigan State in the last eight.
Didn’t Virginia make news last year?
Yes, of the wrong kind. Virginia lost in the first round to the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, becoming the first No. 1 men’s seed to lose to a No. 16. This year, Virginia is again seeded No. 1.
Who’s going to win?
Oddsmakers call it almost even; Virginia is a 1½-point favorite.
Who are the stars?
Virginia’s three-pronged attack has De’Andre Hunter, a scorer also known for his defense, and guards Ty Jerome and Kyle Guy, who made
three crucial free throws
with a second left to beat Auburn in the semifinals.
Texas Tech’s big name is shooting guard Jarrett Culver, who blossomed as a sophomore to become Big 12 player of the year. He leads the team in all three major categories, with 19 points, 4 assists and 6 rebounds a game. He hasn’t yet achieved the fame of another former Texas Tech star, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who drew attention in the stands at the semifinal, but he is getting there.
Will we be seeing any of these players in the N.B.A. next year?
Hunter and Culver could both be selected among the 10 picks in this year’s draft.
Where are the freshmen?
With the elimination of Duke and Kentucky, the freshman-dominated teams have fallen out. No freshman averaged more than 5.3 points for either of the finalists.
How will the game break down?
Slowly. Virginia plays a deliberate style of basketball, having put up the slowest pace in Division I for four years running. Both teams also have great defenses, so scoring
could be at a premium
. Texas Tech likes to trap and force turnovers; Virginia just frustrates opponents until they take a bad shot, or fail to get one off at all.

Duke freshman forward Zion Williamson was named the Associated Press Player of the Year on Friday.
He received 59 of the possible 64 votes in winning the award.
Williamson, who was also a unanimous selection to the 2019 college basketball All-America team on Tuesday, averaged 22.6 points, 8.9 rebounds, 2.1 assists and 1.8 blocks per game.
His 68 percent shooting from the field was second nationally.
Williamson is projected as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2019 NBA Draft, though he has yet to officially commit to going pro.
The Blue Devils lost to Michigan State in the Elite Eight, despite being the overall top seed.

Arkansas has hired Nevada's Eric Musselman as its next men's basketball coach.
The 54-year-old Musselman led a dramatic turnaround in Reno, leading the Wolf Pack to three NCAA Tournament in four years after a nine-year absence. Nevada reached the Sweet 16 in 2018, but lost in the first round to Florida this year.
The son of a former coach, Musselman has had a well-traveled career. He coached the Sacramento Kings and Golden State Warriors in the NBA, had stints in the CBA and D-League, along with assistant jobs in the NBA and college.
Razorbacks athletic director Hunter Yurachek announced Musselman's hiring Sunday on Twitter. Musselman replaces Mike Anderson, who was fired last month after eight seasons.

(Reuters) - Nearly five dozen people were arrested in a Minnesota undercover sting operation for attempting to meet up with children for sex or for sex-trafficking of minors during last weekend's NCAA Final Four basketball tournament, authorities said on Wednesday.
Undercover agents from dozens of agencies in Minnesota spent Friday through Monday posing as children or sex buyers on various social media platforms. The agents chatted with suspects online and then arrested them when they arrived at an arranged meeting place for an encounter, the Minnesota Department of Public Safety said in a statement.
A total of 58 suspects were taken into custody, while 28 victims, including one minor, were rescued from trafficking situations, the department said.
The suspects were not part of a single sex-trafficking ring, said Jill Oliveira, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension with the Department of Public Safety.
""These were separate instances where they either responded to undercover officers posing as sex buyers or undercover officers posing as minors,"" Oliveira said in a phone interview.
The sting operation occurred as ten of thousands of fans converged on Minneapolis for the semifinals and final of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's men's basketball championship, won this year by the University of Virginia.
Some 47 people face felony charges of solicitation of a minor or solicitation of prostitution with someone under 16 years of age. Another 11 were booked on probable cause of sex trafficking and promotion of prostitution, the agency said.
""This operation is an example of the aggressive steps necessary to stop traffickers and johns who buy and sell people for sex in our communities,"" said Drew Evans, superintendent of the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension.
It involved more than 33 local and state agencies along with Homeland Security Investigations, a unit of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
Most of the suspects were from the greater Twin Cities area, the state department of public safety said, referring to Minneapolis and Saint Paul.
Authorities routinely conduct sting operations coinciding with large U.S. sporting events. During the week leading up to this year's Super Bowl in Atlanta, authorities arrested 169 people in a sex-trafficking sting.
The Minnesota sting comes less than two months after New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft was charged with soliciting sex as part of an investigation into sex trafficking at several Florida day spas. Kraft, who has pleaded not guilty, was one of 25 men who were taken into custody in the sting.
More than 5,100 cases of human trafficking were reported to the National Human Trafficking Hotline in 2018. That amounted to 40 percent fewer cases than the 8,500 reported in 2017, which was a five-year high, the organization said.

Take a look at the five highest-scoring seasons in NBA history.
— Wilt Chamberlain scored 4,029 points in 1961-62.
— Chamberlain scored 3,586 in 1962-63.
— Michael Jordan scored 3,041 points in 1986-87.
— Chamberlain scored 3,033 in 1960-61.
— Chamberlain scored 2,948 points in 1963-64.
There they are. The five best seasons in terms of points that the NBA has ever seen. And those five seasons all have something in common — when they were over, someone not named Chamberlain or Jordan was the MVP.
What James Harden did this season for the Houston Rockets was scintillating. He scored 50 or more points nine times. He scored 61 twice. He scored at least 30 points in 32 consecutive games, a stretch that lasted more than two months. He will finish this season with the seventh-highest scoring average in NBA history and win the scoring title by more than 8 points per game — a ridiculous margin.
He wins Most Voluminous Points.
But maybe not the Most Valuable Player.
There are some tremendous individual races in the NBA this season, with a slew of deserving candidates for coach of the year, a rather unexpected two-person race for rookie of the year, and the annual befuddlement about who should win defensive player of the year. The ballot that voters will agonize over most, in some cases, will be the one for MVP.
Is it Harden, for the second straight year?
Or is it Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo?
Compelling cases can be made either way. Harden carried the Rockets and became the most unguardable player in the league. Antetokounmpo took a team that finished seventh in the East last year and lifted it to the No. 1 overall seed in the NBA, continuing his meteoric rise toward total superstardom.
Harden is the better scorer, Antetokounmpo the more accurate shooter. Harden is the better ballhandler and passer, Antetokounmpo the better rebounder and defender. Take Antetokounmpo off the Bucks, and they'd be lucky to make the playoffs. Take Harden off the Rockets, and they'd be lucky to make the playoffs.
The biggest argument for Harden is the scoring. It has been sensational, without question.
But there is precedent, as Chamberlain and Jordan learned. Even a gazillion points doesn't guarantee anyone the Maurice Podoloff Trophy.
When these playoffs are over and the trophy is finally handed out in late June, Harden will find out if scoring was enough to win the vote this time.
It is tradition in this space to end the regular season by having AP Basketball Writers Brian Mahoney and Tim Reynolds reveal their choices for certain awards and predict what will happen in the playoffs.
Their selections:
MVP
Mahoney: Antetokounmpo. Tough to demote Harden when he was even more valuable this season than last, but can't ignore a guy with the Greek Freak's stats on the surprise winningest team in the league.
Reynolds: Antetokounmpo. He gets the nod over Harden because the Bucks enjoyed a level of success that few expected, and he's why.
MOST IMPROVED PLAYER
Mahoney: D'Angelo Russell, Brooklyn. Didn't just have a great season. He saved one for a Nets team that was going nowhere.
Reynolds: Pascal Siakam, Toronto. The Raptors were 14-3 when he had a double-double, and he more than doubled his scoring average.
COACH OF THE YEAR
Mahoney: Mike Budenholzer, Milwaukee. Oversaw improvements across the board to turn a team with playoff aspirations into one with championship aspirations.
Reynolds: Doc Rivers, LA Clippers. Hard call over Budenholzer. Steve Kerr, Nick Nurse, Steve Clifford, Michael Malone and Kenny Atkinson also deserving.
ROOKIE OF THE YEAR
Mahoney: Luka Doncic, Dallas. Not many players become must-see TV before they even turn 20.
Reynolds: Luka Doncic, Dallas. Trae Young came on like gangbusters at the end of the year, but Doncic was better from start to finish.
EASTERN CONFERENCE CHAMPION
Mahoney: Milwaukee. The Bucks do so many things well that they can find a way even when things get tougher.
Reynolds: Toronto. Milwaukee is built for the long haul and might not be ready — yet. But for the Raptors, if not now, then when?
WESTERN CONFERENCE CHAMPION
Mahoney: Golden State. Still by far the best combination of talent and experience in the league.
Reynolds: Golden State. If healthy, the Warriors are still the one to beat. And they want to send Oracle Arena out the right way.
NBA CHAMPIONS
Mahoney: Warriors in 6.
Reynolds: Warriors in 5.
BOLD OFFSEASON PREDICTION
Mahoney: The July 4 fireworks boom brightest in New York, where Kevin Durant is the centerpiece of a transformed Knicks team.
Reynolds: If the Warriors win this title, and they should, expect the core to all come back and try to four-peat. Yes, including Durant.

Bobby Jones, Sidney Moncrief, Paul Westphal, Vlade Divac, Al Attles and Chuck Cooper will be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame this year, ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported late Friday night.
The official announcement is due to be made Saturday in Minneapolis, where the NCAA Final Four is taking place.
According to Wojnarowski, three highly regarded Hall of Fame candidates, Ben Wallace, Chris Webber and Marques Johnson, did not make the cut.
Jones, 67, began his pro career with the Nuggets in the ABA before playing for Denver and then the Philadelphia 76ers in the NBA. He was a five-time All-Star and an 11-time All-Defensive Team selection in 12 seasons, and he earned a championship ring with the 76ers in 1982-83.
Jones averaged 12.1 points, 6.1 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 1.5 steals in his career.
Moncrief, 61, was a two-time Defensive Player of the Year and a five-time All-Defensive Team choice. He made five All-Star teams and was chosen five times to the All-NBA squad.
Moncrief played 10 of his 11 NBA seasons with the Milwaukee Bucks, averaging 15.6 points, 4.7 rebounds, 3.6 assists and 1.2 steals.
Westphal, 68, was a five-time NBA All-Star and four-time All-NBA player as a guard, mostly with the Phoenix Suns. He also was part of the Boston Celtics' 1973-74 championship team. He averaged 15.6 points and 4.4 assists in 12 seasons.
Westphal went on to coach the Suns, the Seattle SuperSonics and the Sacramento Kings, compiling a 318-279 regular-season mark and a 27-22 postseason record.
Divac, a 51-year-old Serbia native, was selected by the Hall of Fame's International Committee, according to Wojnarowski. He played eight seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers, two with the Charlotte Hornets and six with the Sacramento Kings, averaging 11.8 points and 8.2 rebounds.
Divac is currently the Kings' vice president of basketball operations and general manager.
Attles, 82, will be inducted into the Hall of Fame as a contributor, according to ESPN's The Undefeated.
Attles played for the Philadelphia/San Francisco Warriors before coaching the San Francisco/Golden State Warriors for 14 seasons, including the franchise's title-winning 1974-75 campaign. He also served three seasons as the Warriors' general manager.
Cooper, who was the first African-American ever chosen in the NBA draft, was selected by the Hall of Fame's Early African-American Pioneers Committee, Wojnarowski reported. The Boston Celtics selected him in the second round in 1950 out of Duquesne.
He spent six seasons in the NBA in the 1950s, with the Celtics, the Milwaukee/St. Louis Hawks and the Fort Wayne Pistons. Cooper died in 1984 at age 57.

TAMPA, Fla. — Baylor recovered after blowing a 17-point lead and losing a star player, beating Notre Dame 82-81 for the NCAA women's basketball championship Sunday night when 2018 tournament hero Arike Ogunbowale missed a foul shot in the final seconds.
Chloe Jackson made a layup to put Baylor ahead with 3.9 seconds left. Notre Dame called timeout and inbounded to Ogunbowale, whose buzzer-beating jumper in the championship game lifted Notre Dame to last year's title. Ogunbowale was fouled trying for a layup, then missed the first of two free throws. She made the second, but the Irish never got the ball back.
The Lady Bears (37-1) won their first championship in seven years.
Baylor was able to pull off the win without star forward Lauren Cox, who injured her knee late in the third quarter. The Irish were able to rally from a 14-point deficit in the third quarter to tie the game at 78.

House Democrats
have demanded to see the full Mueller report. But how much of it will lawmakers — and the public — actually see?
That’s up to Attorney General William Barr, above, who has been reviewing the 400-page report to decide what to make publicly available, and what to black out. Mr. Barr has promised to give lawmakers as much of the report as possible by mid-April, subject to necessary deletions, but Democrats are growing increasingly impatient with the prospect of a heavily redacted document.
And they’re not alone. Members of Robert Mueller’s team have told associates that
Mr. Barr failed to adequately convey their findings

MINNEAPOLIS — Texas Tech and Virginia have reached the national championship game by leaning on stingy defenses, overlooked and underappreciated stars, and no shortage of nail-biting NCAA Tournament wins.
So, what will it take for the Red Raiders to hoist their first basketball trophy — and second NCAA title trophy in any sport? And what will it take Virginia to finally win its first hoops title?
Here's a look at why they'll win:
TEXAS TECH
Simply put: There is no way that likely NBA lottery pick Jarrett Culver struggles as much as he did in the Red Raiders' semifinal victory over Michigan State, when he committed three turnovers and was held to 10 points on 3-of-12 shooting by the defensive-minded Spartans.
That's only the start, though.
Backcourt mate Davide Moretti, who was downright heroic in their tournament win over Gonzaga, only had five points against Michigan State. Long, lanky forward Tariq Owens missed a good chunk of the second half with a foot injury, though it appears he'll be ready to go against the Cavaliers.
Despite all those hiccups, the Red Raiders still turned back the Big Ten champs.
Maybe they're just a team of destiny.
""Our goal has never been to make a tournament. It's been to win the tournament,"" said Texas Tech coach Chris Beard, the coaching vagabond whose toughness and tenacity has endeared him to fans back in West Texas. ""It's easy to talk about and really, really hard to do. But that's where we started this whole thing, just trying to have the expectations and the vision where we could be relative.""
Oh, his club is quite relative now. The Red Raiders have the nation's No. 1 defense by almost any metric, better even than the Cavs' vaunted pack-line D, and their offense has been so quietly efficient over the past six weeks that Beard took umbrage with the lack of attention it has received.
They also have Culver, who should be the best player on the floor Monday night.
""It means everything,"" he said. ""This is what you started your summer for. This is what you worked all year. Just knowing you're the last two teams playing on Monday night is just so special.""
VIRGINIA
Yes, the Cavaliers are known for defense, but their methodical offense tends to hide the fact that they have been one of the most efficient teams in the country on that end of the floor.
Virginia rarely turns the ball over (8.9 per game, fewest in the country), has one of the best turnover-to-assist ratios in the country (1.59, fifth best) and is seventh in the nation in 3-point field goal percentage (39.4).
Texas Tech's defense is not only the best Virginia has faced this season it is one of the best in recent college basketball history, according to KenPom metrics.
""We're going to have to be ball strong,"" Virginia assistant coach Jason Williford said. ""They get a ton of deflections. They take the ball out of guys' hands.""
With Kyle Guy, Ty Jerome and Kihei Clark, Virginia often has three ball-handlers on the floor. In third-team All-America wing De'Andre Hunter, the Cavaliers have another capable facilitator. That should help in the face of Tech's grinding pressure.
And, of course, Virginia plays lock-down defense, too. This championship game seems destined to be a tight, possession-by-possession affair. The Cavaliers are built for those.
And after pulling off two straight minor miracles to get this far, it's hard not to come away thinking: Whether it's karma or fate or some type of divine intervention, it's just Virginia's year.
""Hopefully, whatever that is,"" center Jack Salt said, ""is still on our side.""

TAMPA, Fla. — Oregon guard Sabrina Ionescu is returning for her senior season.
The Ducks star bylined a story on The Players Tribune titled ""Unfinished Business"" on Saturday night, minutes after the deadline for her to declare for the WNBA draft expired. She was eligible to enter the draft following her junior season because she will turn 22 this year.
The AP All-American wrote in the piece, ""I came to the University of Oregon as a freshman in 2016-2017. We made the Elite Eight (and lost big). I came back to the University of Oregon as a sophomore in 2017-2018. We made the Elite Eight (and lost close). I came back to the University of Oregon as a junior in 2018-2019. We made the Final Four. And now I couldn't be happier to announce that I'm coming back to the University of Oregon for the 2019-2020 basketball season. I won't predict exactly how far we're going to go... but I'll just say this. We have unfinished business.""
Oregon lost to Baylor in the national semifinals Friday night. Ionescu had 24 hours following the loss to declare for the draft.
The Ducks return most of their team that won the Pac-12 regular season title and most likely will be a favorite to win the national championship next year.

Kentucky standout sophomore PJ Washington declared for the NBA Draft on Tuesday and will hire an agent, the school announced.
""This place has been my home for two years and it's hard for me to put in words how much I've grown in my time at Kentucky. The staff challenged me from day one to become the best version of myself and to work hard to become one of the best players in college basketball. I feel like I've done that,"" Washington said in a statement posted on the Wildcats' website.
The 6-foot-8 forward ends his career with 932 points, 476 rebounds 120 assists and 74 blocks. He led the Wildcats in scoring (15.2) and rebounding (7.5) this past season. He also posted nine double-doubles and shot 52.2 percent from the floor, including 42.3 percent from the 3-point line.
Washington earned first team All-SEC and third team All-America honors.
""PJ transformed everything about his game. He became a national player of the year candidate, he showed his full set of his skills and he improved his stock while helping us become one of the best teams in the country,"" Kentucky coach John Calipari said.
Washington is projected to be a mid-first-round pick by ESPN.

N.C.A.A. Basketball Tournament
By
Kelly Whiteside
TAMPA, Fla. — After Notre Dame defeated Connecticut in the Final Four on Friday, Coach Muffet McGraw, wearing a shirt as shiny as the university’s Golden Dome, did a jig of sorts on the court.
There were plenty of reasons to celebrate after the Irish advanced to their second straight N.C.A.A. women’s basketball title game.
[
Read about Baylor’s win over the Oregon Ducks.
]
Once again, they had upended the game’s longtime powerhouse in a national semifinal. In a Final Four classic last year, Notre Dame beat UConn on a last-second overtime shot by Arike Ogunbowale. Friday’s
81-76 win
for the Irish was a fitting encore, with similar back-and-forth drama.
They will try to repeat as champions on Sunday, when they face Baylor in a rematch of the 2012 final, which the Lady Bears won easily.
For UConn, this was the third consecutive year of falling a win short of reaching the championship game. Coach Geno Auriemma had poked fun at suggestions that the Huskies reached a down cycle after winning four straight titles and 111 consecutive games until the 2017 Final Four.
“We had a lot of adversity this year. We lost two games,” Auriemma said before Friday’s defeat turned the Huskies’ record to 35-3.
Though he acknowledged on Friday that the Irish were the better team, Auriemma reminded reporters twice of his dynasty at UConn, which includes 11 national titles.
“We knew coming in there’s things Notre Dame does that we don’t have an answer for. I’ve had those kind of teams a couple of times,” he said smiling.
The lead changed hands 26 times between the Irish and the Huskies, almost mirroring the earlier semifinal, in which Baylor barely escaped a tenacious Oregon team.
Early in the fourth quarter, UConn surged to a 9-point lead. “We had Coach a little bit stressed,” Notre Dame forward Jessica Shepard said.
That deficit, Auriemma said, could have rattled a lesser team, but not the Irish.
“Why? Because they’re defending national champions,” he said. “They have five all-Americans who are really, really good. Like I said, I remember being in that situation a couple of times.”
The Irish kept their composure, and key defensive plays by the senior forward Brianna Turner plus big shots from Ogunbowale changed the momentum.
“She’s almost an impossible matchup one-on-one,” Auriemma said of Ogunbowale.
After a quiet first half with just 2 points, Ogunbowale exploded in the final 20 minutes, finishing with 23. Turner had 15 points and 5 blocks, setting the school’s career blocks record with 371.
“That was the key. The girl was amazing,” McGraw said about Turner’s defense.
When the Irish won the national title last year, Turner was out with a knee injury, which made this victory especially meaningful. Now she has a chance to win a national title of her own.
A healthy Turner contributed a lot this season, and she will be called upon against Baylor’s seemingly indomitable duo in the post, Kalani Brown and Lauren Cox.
“She gives us just a totally different look,” McGraw said. “What she can do defensively, she can switch out and guard the point guard, she can certainly guard the post. She’s a shot-blocking presence inside. I think it makes us a little more dominant inside, which won’t be so dominant against Baylor because they’re equally talented in the post.”
A day after giving a
passionate speech
about gender inequality and the need for more female leaders, McGraw took note that both coaches in the final are women. The last time that happened was in 2012, when McGraw also faced Baylor’s Kim Mulkey.
Though that was significant to McGraw, she quickly turned the conversation back to the task at hand.
“This weekend is really all about basketball,” she said. “So we really want to focus on that.”

Kyle Korver, the veteran N.B.A. player, said he was embarrassed by some of his thoughts about race in the past and uncomfortable about the contradictions of being a white player in a largely black sport. And in an essay in The Players’ Tribune, he strongly urged action to redress racism around the N.B.A. and in the United States.
In
the essay, titled “Privileged,”
Korver, who plays for the Utah Jazz, recounted an incident from when he played for the Atlanta Hawks. After a teammate, Thabo Sefolosha, was injured and arrested in New York in 2015, Korver said his first reaction was, “What was Thabo doing out at a club on a back-to-back?” rather than concern about the injury or dismay over the arrest. “I sort of blamed Thabo,” he said.
Cringing at that thought today, Korver noted that as a white man, “I probably would’ve been safe on the street that one night in New York.”
In March, Russell Westbrook of the Oklahoma City Thunder had an altercation with a fan in Salt Lake City. Korver told a reporter at the time: “You know Russ. He gets into it with the crowd a lot.” But soon after, he heard the full story, that Westbrook heard the fan make “racial” remarks, as Westbrook put it. His teammates shared stories of similar experiences. “Guys were just sick and tired of it all,” he wrote.
His words resonated as a white player speaking on race, in a league with predominantly black athletes playing before predominantly white crowds.
He noted this position: “I have more in common with the fans in the crowd at your average N.B.A. game than I have with the players on the court.”
“I may work with those guys. And I absolutely 100 percent stand with them. But I look like the other guy. And whether I like it or not? I’m beginning to understand how that means something.”
The essay drew positive reactions from the world of the N.B.A. and elsewhere.
“Salute my brother,” LeBron James said on Twitter. “Means a lot. And like you said, I hope people listen, just open your ears and listen.”
Korver, 38, has played for five N.B.A. teams over a career dating to 2003. At his peak, he was one of the game’s best shooters, especially 3-pointers. This season, he is averaging 9 points and 20 minutes a game with the Jazz.
His essay wrestles with systemic racism throughout America, and Korver said: “As white people, are we guilty of the sins of our forefathers? No, I don’t think so. But are we responsible for them? Yes, I believe we are.”
“It’s about understanding on a fundamental level that black people and white people, they still have it different in America. And that those differences come from an ugly history … not some random divide.”
“I believe that what’s happening to people of color in this country — right now, in 2019 — is wrong,” he said.

Passing up the possibility of being the No. 1 overall pick in the WNBA draft, All-America guard Sabrina Ionescu announced Saturday that she will return to Oregon for her senior season.
Ionescu, the all-time NCAA triple-double leader with 18, guided the Ducks to the Final Four before they lost 72-67 to Baylor in the national semifinals on Friday in Tampa, Fla.
In a post on the Player Tribune titled, ""A Letter to Ducks Nation,"" Ionescu wrote Saturday, ""I came to the University of Oregon as a freshman in 2016-2017. We made the Elite Eight (and lost big).
""I came back to the University of Oregon as a sophomore in 2017-2018. We made the Elite Eight (and lost close).
""I came back to the University of Oregon as a junior in 2018-2019. We made the Final Four.
""And now I couldn't be happier to announce that I'm coming back to the University of Oregon for the 2019-2020 basketball season. I won't predict exactly how far we're going to go ... but I'll just say this.
""We have unfinished business.""
Ionescu averaged 19.9 points, 7.4 rebounds and 8.2 assists per game this season. The Walnut Creek, Calif., product scored 18 points in the loss on Friday.
According to espnW, Ionescu was likely to be the top selection in the WNBA draft, scheduled for Wednesday, had she decided to turn pro. She was eligible to enter the WNBA because she will turn 22 this year.

MINNEAPOLIS — If it can defeat third-seeded Texas Tech on Monday night, Virginia would not become the first national champion that had lost in the first round of the N.C.A.A. tournament the previous year. Duke did it in 2015, and Indiana in 1987. Connecticut won the 2014 title a year after it had been barred from postseason play for poor academic performance.
But nonetheless, a win by top-seeded Virginia (34-3) would be different. Of course it would be different. Not all losses are created equal, and Virginia’s tournament experience last year was quite a moment to overcome.
So many factors compounded last March to make the result of Virginia’s game versus the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, so awful for the Cavaliers. There was the sheer history of being the first No. 1 seed ever to lose to a No. 16 seed in the men’s tournament. There was the fact that the game itself was not close: The Cavaliers lost by 20 points. There was the size of the fall, as Virginia was not only a top seed last year but the overall top seed, deemed the very best team in the country only days before its stunning exit. And U.M.B.C., with its
inspiring academic story
and clever Twitter feed, was an underdog — a Cheseapake retriever, to be precise — straight from central casting,
so magnetic
that there was barely time to feel bad for a Virginia team that had just had the equivalent of a 20-ton weight dropped on it.
That day last March in Charlotte, N.C., when it was time for the postgame news conference, Coach Tony Bennett elected not to have his outgoing senior stars, Isaiah Wilkins and Devon Hall, join him at the dais, he recalled Saturday night after his team (barely) defeated fifth-seeded Auburn, 63-62,
to reach this year’s final
. Instead, he tapped Kyle Guy and Ty Jerome, two sophomores who he knew would be back.
In the end of that season, Bennett was implicitly declaring, lay the beginning of the next.
“You guys need to be up there with me,” was his message to Guy and Jerome then, he said, “and we need to go through this, and we need to go through next year together.”
The Cavaliers and their coach
have since not cared to speak
about that loss, especially once this season began. But over the course of this year’s tournament, as they have dealt with slightly modified versions of the exact same question every step of the way — “Every round I say the same thing almost,” Jerome said Saturday, “and it feels a little bit sweeter” — it has become clear that last year still looms large for the team.
The bad mojo seemed to have broken in Virginia’s regional-final victory over Purdue, in which Virginia had been bound for defeat until a missed free throw and a ball bounding into the backcourt led the freshman point guard Kihei Clark to make the play of the tournament, sending a half-court pass to Mamadi Diakite, who caught and released and swished the ball in at the buzzer to force an overtime period that Virginia won by 5 points.
But then the Auburn game happened: Again, Virginia trailed by 2 points with only seconds left. Only this time, Guy was fouled on a 3-pointer he missed, and he made all three shots.
Team of destiny? Or lucky?
Is there a difference?
Texas Tech (31-6) has its own inspirational story. A popular fact making the rounds is that if the Red Raiders — who looked dominant
defeating second-seeded Michigan State
, 61-51, on Saturday night — win it all, theirs would be only the second Division I men’s championship awarded to a team from the Lone Star State, after the 1966 title that Texas Western so famously won.
But Texas Tech’s historic underachievement in men’s basketball is the more relevant narrative thread. Virginia is considered insufficiently blue-blooded because this is only its third Final Four. By contrast, this year was only Texas Tech’s second round of 8. The first was last year. That is pretty neat.
And even that trajectory lacks the drama of Virginia’s, as no less a figure than Texas Tech Coach Chris Beard pointed out Saturday night. “Like all other college basketball fans, from the heartbreak of last year to be playing in the national championship on Monday night,” he said, “it’s a story that you pull for.”
The teams do not present an especially compelling contrast on the court. Texas Tech does not play as slow as Virginia — nobody does — but it plays pretty slow. Virginia relies on 3-pointers more than Texas Tech does. Texas Tech forces more turnovers than Virginia does, but Virginia gives up far fewer turnovers than Texas Tech does.
Virginia was the better team before the N.C.A.A. tournament, when it lost only to Duke — not only a super-talented team, but a nightmare matchup — and to Florida State in the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament, while Texas Tech bowed out of the Big 12 tournament in its opening game to a West Virginia team that had a losing record.
In the N.C.A.A. tournament, though, Texas Tech has been far better. The Red Raiders have won their five games, including those against two No. 2 seeds and top-seeded Gonzaga, by an average of 14 points, while the Cavaliers, against worse competition, have an average victory margin of nearly half that (and under half that if one counts the Purdue game as a regulation tie).
But college basketball does not decide its champion by deciding who its best team is. If it did, Virginia would have been last year’s national champion. And because it does not, Virginia has a chance to be this year’s.
Bennett, Virginia’s coach, is an openly spiritual man, so it is not that surprising that before Saturday night’s stunningly close victory over Auburn he offered his team a prescient little sermon on the loaves and the fishes.
That is the biblical story of what happened when Jesus suggested to his disciples that they feed 5,000 men and women. The disciples said they had neither enough food to feed so many people nor the money to buy more. All they had, in fact, was five loaves of bread and two fish.
In the story, Jesus took the food, gave thanks, broke the loaves and handed the pieces to the disciples, who handed them to the people. Somehow, it multiplied. “They all ate and were satisfied,” the Book of Matthew says. (According to the Book of John, the feat took place near the Jewish holiday of Passover — just like the Final Four.)
“That was enough to feed everyone,” the Virginia junior Braxton Key said after Saturday’s game, recounting the story.
In other words: The overtime win over Purdue was enough, as the 1-point win over Auburn turned out to be enough, and as a victory over Texas Tech after a standout season and a haphazard tournament would be enough.
“Coach was saying, what we have right now is enough,” Key said. “And it definitely will multiply.”

MINNEAPOLIS — Being great is a series of sacrifices. Or possibly a continuous case study in self-denial if the ultimate goal is to be a champion.
That's the hook Texas Tech head coach Chris Beard set for his men's basketball team in the offseason. Just as Tom Brady can't recall the last time he had a slice of pizza, Beard wanted his players to understand that decision goes beyond counting calories. And he went big, relatively speaking, to show his players he meant business. He started by punting ... beer.
""It hasn't been easy,"" Beard said with a knowing, if sympathetic, nod from rows of media Friday in the bowels of U.S. Bank Stadium. ""We make sacrifices every year. Team, players, before we start official practice, we pick this up. LeBron James eliminates social media in the playoffs. I want to say Tom Brady enjoys a beer from time to time, too. He gives it up in an NFL season. It's just the idea of elite people making sacrifices and having discipline.
""There's guys on our team that have given up Netflix after 9 p.m. There's guys on our team that have given up social media. There's guys that have given up fried food. You basically have to sacrifice something. In our culture, if you say you're going to do it, you'd better do it, or you're about to get roasted.
""So me this year, it's no beer, no desserts, no candy. I haven't had any ice cream, candy, cake, beer, since the first day of practice. A couple things, though. Did you know a Pop-Tart is not a dessert! It's a breakfast. I've eaten a lot of Pop-Tarts, man, since October.""
Beard knows a thing or two about sacrifice. He said there are ""a lot of guys in this Final Four coaching that aren't getting paid."" Beard said Friday it wasn't until his fourth job in college basketball that he earned a paycheck.
""You know, you scrap,"" he said. ""We did private lessons on the side, rebound for guys, and used to cut cardboard boxes behind this grocery store, and then they'd pay -- because you could work at any time as long as the boxes were cut by the next morning, and just all sorts of stuff like that. I don't think coaching is any different, though. I've got friends in other professions. You sacrifice. When you find something you love, you sacrifice. None of us do this -- [Texas Tech guard] Jarrett Culver doesn't play -- he plays for the love of the game and not what the game does for him, and the same thing for Norense.
""Don't tell Kirby Hocutt, my AD, this, but I would do this job for free. Do I have y'all's word that you won't put that out there?""
Beard won't be working for free again, but his example caught on at Tech.
Beard, who coached under Bobby Knight at Texas Tech and later was on Pat Knight's staff, quickly noticed players were following suit.
Odiase, a fifth-year senior, decided to enact blackout periods for cellphone use, especially on the road during the Big 12 season. It started with team bonding in mind but became a mandate with expanded restrictions.
""We played on the road at Oklahoma, and it was a good idea to stay focused, locked in, get some rest, and we went on a big winning streak,"" Odiase said. ""So ever since then, coach, if we come to -- say we play on Saturday and we come on Wednesday, every night, no matter if it's before the game or not, we've been taking the phone up. It's helped us. Some of the young guys don't like it, but it's great to be disciplined and get rest.""
All-Big 12 wing Culver -- who smirked through a good-natured ribbing from Beard about perhaps talking to his roommate instead of clinging to his phone -- said there was little resistance to the idea of unplugging because the results were undeniable.
""I feel like it's good for us,"" Culver said. ""I mean, you don't have nothing to do. You can't be on your phone. You're not on social media, you don't have your phone. Can't talk to nobody. So it kind of forces you to get rest and get the sleep you need. I feel like it helps us. Once we went on that run, we just kind of stuck with it as a tradition.""

MINNEAPOLIS — One of the first summertime meetings coach Chris Beard held with Texas Tech's basketball team in July included a challenge to the team: Make a reservation to play in the NCAA Tournament final.
""He told us, 'We have enough talent in here to play on the final Monday of the season,'"" said Matt Mooney, a fifth-year senior who scored a game-high 22 points on 8-of-16 shooting to spark the Red Raiders to a 61-51 victory over Michigan State on Saturday in their first-ever Final Four appearance.
The win gets Texas Tech that reservation for Monday night in the national championship game against Virginia.
""Very seldom in my career have we got beat up,"" Spartans coach Tom Izzo said. ""I mean, they played really good defense. ... That's a tough, rugged team.""
Michigan State trailed for 30 minutes, 7 seconds in the 40-minute game and shot 31.9 percent from the field (15 of 47). Big Ten Player of the Year Cassius Winston had a team-best 16 points but shot 4 of 16 and committed four turnovers.
""Their defense is really, really good,"" said Winston, who was dogged by Mooney most of the game. ""They got their hands on a lot of balls. We could have been a lot better. But their defense was really good.""
Mooney, in his first year at Texas Tech as a graduate transfer and his third college overall, filled the hero role. Teammate Jarrett Culver, the Big 12 Player of the Year, was quiet until a raindrop right-handed runner gave Texas Tech its first field goal in five minutes and a 54-51 edge with 2:28 left.
Culver finished with 10 points.
""The thing that impressed me tonight was his courage,"" Beard said of Mooney, who tied his season high in scoring and doubled his season average of 11 points per game. ""When Michigan State was focused on Culver so much, Matt had the courage to step up and make those shots.""
A bid by Michigan State senior Matt McQuaid to tie the game with a long 3-point attempt with 1:52 to go rattled in and out, and Culver made the first of two free throws 20 seconds later.
On Michigan State's next possession, Texas Tech got the ball back with its fourth steal of the game, this one by senior Norense Odiase. Culver then hit an uncontested trey from the top of the key, putting the Red Raiders up 58-51.
Odiase made two free throws to seal it with 39.7 seconds left after the Spartans' Kenny Goins clanked a 3-point try.
The Spartans stayed in the game at the free-throw line, making 14 of their 18 attempts.
""It wasn't really a game that we were really out of. It wasn't a game that I ever felt comfortable in it,"" Izzo said, giving further credit to Texas Tech's constricting defense.
Sophomore Xavier Tillman rattled in two free throws after Winston connected on four consecutive shots from the stripe, and Michigan State whittled a 12-point deficit to five (52-47) with 5:38 remaining.
The Spartans cut it to three with just over three minutes to play on freshman Aaron Henry's two makes, then made it 52-51 when Henry's slashing layup went in with 2:44 left.
Texas Tech roared out of the halftime locker room with buckets on four of five possessions and took an eight-point lead -- 39-31 -- on a three-point play by Kyler Edwards. The freshman drove hard from the left baseline and moved the ball from his right to left hand, putting it off the glass as he was fouled.
On the next possession, Mooney connected on a 3-ball from the wing, and after a Michigan State turnover, he drilled another to stake Texas Tech to a 45-33 advantage, prompting a red-faced Izzo to call timeout.
""Mooney hit two shots, one with a guy right in his face and one that was right over here,"" Izzo said. ""I didn't see it, it was so far out. They earned it, they deserved it.""
Most of the damage was done while Culver watched from the bench with three fouls.
Suffocating defense won the first half on either end, and neither team could find its legs. Only 15 of 49 field-goal attempts went through, and Texas Tech led 23-21 at the break.
""We knew we weren't going to out-tough Michigan State,"" said Beard, though by most postgame accounts in either locker room, the Red Raiders did that very thing. ""We had a little team meeting (Sunday). I told them, that's not going to happen. We're going to try to equal their toughness. We're going to try to compete in this game.
""The thing I'm most proud of is for 40 minutes, we went shot for shot with one of the all-time greats in college basketball.""
Texas Tech's reservation awaits.

Wofford coach Mike Young, who took the Terriers to five NCAA Tournament appearances, has accepted the head coaching position at Virginia Tech, the school announced Sunday.
Young compiled a 299-244 mark in 17 seasons as the head coach at Wofford, which went 30-5 this season and advanced to the second round of the NCAA Tournament. The seventh-seeded Terriers defeated Seton Hall in the first round before losing to No. 2 Kentucky.
Young replaces Buzz Williams, who left last week to coach Texas A&M. The Hokies advanced to the Sweet 16 this season before falling 75-73 to No. 1 seed Duke.
""We are fortunate to have been able to recruit Mike Young to Virginia Tech, not only because of his proven leadership and coaching ability, but because Coach Young is home in Southwest Virginia and leads his life in the true Hokie tradition of integrity and commitment to service,"" Virginia Tech president Tim Sands said in a statement.
Young, a native Virginian, has been on the basketball staff at Wofford -- located in Spartanburg, S.C. -- for 30 years.
Wofford finished this season with an 18-0 Southern Conference record. Young was the Sporting News Coach of the Year, while he finished third in AP Coach of the Year voting behind Texas Tech's Chris Beard and Houston's Kelvin Sampson.
The Terriers won the Southern Conference tournament five times in the past 10 seasons and captured the conference's regular-season title in four of those five years.
This season topped the others, as the Terriers broke into the AP Top 25 for the first time in school history. The NCAA Tournament victory was also a first for the school after four losses, dating to 2010.
The Terriers' only regular-season losses were to then-No. 8 North Carolina to start the season, Oklahoma, then-No. 2 Kansas and then-No. 17 Mississippi State.

MINNEAPOLIS — The Latest on the NCAA Tournament championship game between Virginia and Texas Tech (all times local):
2:30 p.m.
A look at advanced statistics for the NCAA Tournament shows that Virginia's offense has been more efficient than Texas Tech, but the Red Raiders are locking down on opponents at a tougher rate.
The Cavaliers have scored an average of nearly 1.14 points per possession while scoring on a little better than 50% of their possessions in the tournament. That was slightly better than the Red Raiders, who averaged 1.08 points per possession while scoring on about 48% of their tournament possessions.
Virginia continues to play slower-paced games overall by averaging 57.8 possessions per game in the tournament. Texas Tech averages 64.4 possessions.
Yet while Virginia's offense has been more efficient in the tournament, the Red Raiders' defense has been tougher statistically. Texas Tech has held all five of its tournament opponents to less than a point per possession.
— Aaron Beard reporting from Minneapolis
___
2 p.m.
Texas Tech and Virginia are each going for their first national titles backed by hard-nosed defenses that were among the best in the nation.
Virginia (34-3) the standard-bearer in lockdown basketball. The Cavaliers are going against the new kids on the defensive block, the Texas Tech Red Raiders (31-6).
The over/under for points is 118. The over/under on bruises may be higher.
The result will give the NCAA Tournament its first first-time champion since coach Billy Donovan won it all with Florida in 2006.
Texas Tech reached the Elite Eight for the first time last season and Virginia lost its previous two trips to the Final Four, in 1981 and 1984.
The last time two teams who had never won a championship played in the title game was Michigan State against Indiana State in 1979. That's right, Magic Johnson vs. Larry Bird.
The game Monday night tips at 8:20 p.m. Central time (9:20 p.m. Eastern).

UCLA ended a long search Tuesday by naming Cincinnati's Mick Cronin as the 14th head coach of the Bruins.
According to ESPN, Cronin agreed to a six-year, $24 million deal.
Cronin, 47, replaces Steve Alford, who was fired in December midway through his sixth season.
Cronin spent the last 13 seasons at his alma mater Cincinnati, leading the Bearcats to nine consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances and a 296-147 record. He was 69-24 in three seasons at Murray State before taking over at Cincinnati in 2006.
""Mick Cronin is a fierce competitor, and I'm excited to welcome him to Westwood,"" UCLA athletic director Dan Guerrero said in a statement. ""Mick has built a fantastic program at Cincinnati, backed by integrity and discipline, and he has instilled an undeniable toughness in his student-athletes. I am confident he will build this program the right way and lead UCLA basketball back to national prominence.""
The Bruins pursued a number of high-profile coaches before reaching a deal with Cronin, terms of which were not immediately available. TCU's Jamie Dixon, Tennessee's Rick Barnes, Virginia's Tony Bennett and Kentucky's John Calipari were all linked to the search.
UCLA won 10 national championships in a 12-season stretch under the legendary John Wooden in the 1960s and 1970s, but the Bruins haven't been to the Final Four since 2008 and have not won the NCAA Tournament since 1995.
Cronin said he was excited about the challenge ahead of him.
""I am incredibly humbled and honored to become the head coach at UCLA,"" Cronin said. ""UCLA is a very special place with a strong tradition of excellence. To be able to join such a world-class institution is truly a privilege, and I can't wait to get started in Westwood.""
The Bruins finished 17-16 this season, including 9-9 in the Pac-12.
Cronin's Bearcats were 28-7 and lost to Iowa in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.

MINNEAPOLIS — NBA Hall of Famer Oscar Robertson was eyeball to shoulder alongside larger-than-life freshman Zion Williamson on Friday night, posing for photographers as he handed off the national player of the year award that bears his name and likeness, when he offered a warning for the basketball world.
""You may not believe it now, but you can get a whole lot better,"" Robertson said of Williamson.
Williamson averaged 22.9 points and 8.8 rebounds, shooting 68.8 percent with a package of ferocious finishes at the rim and a soft touch from the perimeter.
""When I watched Zion, I watched his footwork and his intelligence when he went into the basket because everyone was after him. They were going to double-team him and triple-team him and do all these things to try to keep him from around the basket,"" said Robertson. ""He's so gifted and he's just so quick and so high, it's difficult for any one person to guard him.
""And as I said before, he's going to get better when he gets to the next level.""
Williamson was not a unanimous pick for either player of the year award he took home Friday night, but he is universally expected to be the first player drafted in June.
Williamson, who is 6-7, 280 pounds, said he still wants to talk to his family and teammate RJ Barrett -- another Duke freshman projected as a lottery pick in 2019 -- before making anything official.
But every indication from Williamson, Robertson and Williamson's family in attendance suggested that his college career is over.
""Whatever NBA team I land on, that's the team I want to -- that's where I want to be. Like whoever drafts me, that's where I want to be,"" said Williamson, who reacted to questions implying he wouldn't want to play for the lottery-odds-leading Knicks by shaking his head and putting his massive hand over his face.
""If they draft me, I would love to play for them.""

Duke forward Zion Williamson continued his collection of accolades on Sunday when he won the 2019 Citizen Naismith Trophy as the top college basketball in the country, the Atlanta Tipoff Club announced during a press conference in Minneapolis.
Williamson is the third freshman to win the honor, joining Kevin Durant of Texas in 2007 and Anthony Davis of Kentucky in 2012.
The other three finalists were Gonzaga junior forward Rui Hachimura, Tennessee junior forward Grant Williams and Murray State sophomore point guard Ja Morant.
Williamson won the Oscar Robertson Trophy and Associated Press Player of the Year honors on Friday. He also was the Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year. Williamson averaged 22.6 points, 8.9 rebounds, 2.1 assists and 1.8 blocks per game.
Williamson is the eighth Duke player to win the prestigious award.
""I want to thank the Citizen Naismith Trophy committee for selecting me as the Player of the Year. It is truly an honor to receive this and join such an elite list of former Blue Devils to have also won the award,"" Williamson said in a statement. ""There were so many great players who could have won this award this year. I can't thank my teammates, coaches and family enough for helping me. This is a team award, and it's an honor for me to accept this on behalf of my brothers.""
Williamson led Duke to a 32-6 record. The Blue Devils advanced to the Elite Eight, where they lost to Michigan State.
""Zion is absolutely deserving of this year's Citizen Naismith Trophy. He handled himself with such class and humility this season, especially given what he accomplished, both individually and with his team,"" Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said in a statement. ""Zion is a great representative of the game and is a pleasure to coach.
""Duke has a long history of Naismith winners, and Zion certainly belongs in that elite company.""
Duke's most recent Naismith winner was JJ Redick in 2006. The other Blue Devils to earn the honor are Jason Williams (2002), Shane Battier (2001), Elton Brand (1999), Christian Laettner (1992), Danny Ferry (1989) and Johnny Dawkins (1986).
Williamson is expected to declare for the NBA draft and is projected to be the No. 1 overall pick.

The N.C.A.A. men’s basketball final on Monday night looks like a close contest; some people are picking Virginia, while others like Texas Tech.
But there’s one prediction everyone agrees on: It will be a low-scoring game.
Bookmakers have set the game’s over/under — a guess as to how many total points will be scored — at somewhere between 117 and 119. That will be the lowest over/under since at least the early 1990s, as far back as data is available.
The 2006 Florida-U.C.L.A. game and the 2010 Duke-Butler games were the previous low over/unders, a full 10 points higher at 128,
sportsbetting.ag
reports. The Florida game ended with 130 points scored and the Duke game with 120 total. Only three times since 1991 has the final game gone under 118.
The reason for the low total this year is the identity of the finalists. Both of them play stifling defense.
Texas Tech ranked first in N.C.A.A. Division I in defense, allowing only 86.5 points per 100 possessions. Virginia ranked sixth. Texas Tech allowed opposing teams to shoot just 36.8 percent from the field, also the best in Division I. Virginia was fifth.
The effect of the outstanding defenses will be compounded by Virginia’s glacial style of play: For the fourth year in a row, Virginia played at the slowest pace in the nation, 60.8 possessions per 40 minutes. (In contrast, North Carolina had 75.9 possessions and Duke 73.2. Does that sound like a more appetizing final?)
This expectation of a low-scoring game may seem incongruous in an era of high-scoring games in both college
and the N.B.A.
, helped along by an increase in 3-point shooting.
But neither of Monday’s finalists especially likes the long ball: Virginia took a 3-pointer on 40 percent of its shots, ranking 153rd out of Of 353 Division I teams. Texas Tech was at 36 percent, for 256th. Villanova (54 percent, ranked third) or Auburn (49 percent) would have provided a more exciting show from distance.
The lowest-scoring final of recent times came in 2011, when Connecticut beat Butler, 53-41. The New York Times
proclaimed in a headline
that “Connecticut and Butler Saved the Worst for Last.”
The statistics seem to suggest we could be in for a repeat.

MINNEAPOLIS — Sometime during the Final Four on Saturday, the television cameras will focus on Auburn Coach Bruce Pearl. They are likely to find him in his usual animated state: limping up and down the sideline, screaming, arms flailing, his face the color of a bowl of borscht, his once-pressed suit reduced to a rumpled outfit paying homage to the land of a thousand (perspiration) lakes.
“He might as well be out there on the floor with us with a jersey on, honestly, the way he’ll be sweating,” Auburn forward Malik Dunbar said with a laugh. “He wants to win so badly.”
Pearl’s problem, at least at several previous stops in a nearly four-decade coaching career, is that he wants to win so badly he
does not always play by the rules
. Yes, he has led Auburn (30-9) to its first Final Four, and to a date with Virginia (33-3) in Saturday’s first national semifinal. But before that, Pearl committed a recruiting violation at Wisconsin-Milwaukee, was fired for a similar one at Tennessee, got blackballed by the N.C.A.A. and then saw two assistants leave his staff at Auburn under the cloud of F.B.I. investigations.
But lost in his scofflaw history and his sideline histrionics is this: Bruce Pearl can coach.
Pearl, 59, relishes his role as an outsider. He was a student manager at Boston College, he is the third Jew to take a team to the Final Four and he spent a decade in Division II when nobody would hire him for trying to get a rival program in trouble with the N.C.A.A. Yet he has arrived in Minneapolis at the top of his game, on his terms.
That is, as an underdog.
At Auburn, basketball has largely been an afterthought — a diversion between football and spring football — but the Tigers, seeded fifth in the Midwest Region, arrived at their first Final Four by taking down three of the game’s blue bloods: Kansas, North Carolina and Kentucky. Next up is Virginia, the only remaining No. 1 seed.
“He has a great way of motivating people,” Auburn center Austin Wiley said of Pearl. “If he has ammo to use, he’s definitely going to use it, and we’re going to run through a brick wall.”
Pearl has changed little since he left the knee of Tom Davis, whom he had followed from Boston College to Stanford to Iowa as an assistant. He still espouses Davis’s tenets — pressure defense and playing fast — and a commitment to firing away from the 3-point line.
Pearl rode that organized chaos to the Division II championship at Southern Indiana in 1995, and it lends itself to playing in the N.C.A.A. tournament as an underdog, which is where Pearl’s teams have often excelled. He is 7-6 in the tournament as a lower-seeded team, having taken 12th-seeded Wisconsin-Milwaukee to the round of 16 in 2005, sixth-seeded Tennessee to a regional final in 2010 and, now, fifth-seeded Auburn to the Final Four.
It is hardly a surprise for some of his former players to see Auburn’s guards, Jared Harper and Bryce Brown, who were largely written off as too small or too frail by other programs, play like five-star talents for Pearl.
“Right away, when you put that uniform, he instills that confidence in you,” said Marc Hostetter, the point guard on Pearl’s championship team at Southern Indiana and now a middle school principal in Mount Vernon, Ind. “We all thought we were Division I players and it was somebody else’s fault that we weren’t there. I can’t overstate the fact that everybody plays as hard as they’ve ever played for him.”
That championship came after his Screaming Eagles fell behind the University of California, Riverside by 22 points early in the final and by 18 at halftime before storming back.
Stan Gouard, the star of that team, said Pearl did not yell at him. He would just tell Gouard that he was being outplayed. Or he would just make a face — one of many now familiar to Auburn players.
“They’re funny gestures,” said Gouard, now coaching at the University of Indianapolis. “Those faces are, ‘You’re not doing your job, you need to do better.’ Sometimes, the face says a lot of words.”
When Pearl finally returned to Division I at Wisconsin-Milwaukee, he once watched his team going through the motions in a game at lowly Cleveland State, lulled to sleep by a comfortable lead and a crowd of about 1,000 fans. Pearl called timeout.
“He sat us down, told a dry-sense-of-humor dad joke and after the punch line, just stood up and walked to the water cooler at the end of the bench,” said Adrian Tigart, who played on Pearl’s round of 16 team at Wisconsin-Milwaukee. “We all just looked at each other kind of confused, then laughed. He is so in tune with his guys and knows what levers to pull and when.”
When Tigert saw Pearl — who used to wear an orange blazer at Tennessee when the Vols played in-state rivals and who once
turned up shirtless and painted orange
for a Lady Vols basketball game — celebrating with Auburn fans on his way off the court after the win against Kentucky, he knew it was not for show.
“The double hand wave, like a politician?” Tigert said. “He used to do that on a Tuesday night when we’d go down to U.I.C. and there would be 30 people who had brought a fan bus down to Chicago.”
If some of it seems engineered, Pearl will not argue.
He is always looking, always evaluating, always gauging for how to make a connection. And he will rely on it again on Saturday, when he has told his players to act as if they have been here before, even thought they have not.
“I never felt like I had all the answers, but I want to give my guys confidence,” Pearl said. “I tell my players, ‘Like sometimes you have to overcome a bad call or a teammate taking a bad shot, you’ve got to overcome me.’ But I can say, look over a period of time and I’ve won a national championship and I’ve won. So they need to draw a certain level of confidence from me that we’ve been there and that what we do works.”
So when Pearl is a disheveled mess on Saturday, hobbling, screaming, making faces and drenched in a puddle of sweat, he is merely staying in character — and hoping his team does the same.

Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer resume their cat-and-mouse game in “Killing Eve.” And Lena Waithe’s “The Chi” returns to Showtime.
KILLING EVE
8 p.m. on AMC and BBC America.
The first season of this spy vs. assassin series ended with a stab to the gut. As Season 2 begins, Villanelle (Jodie Comer) is still bleeding from it. She’s the assassin, and a target of obsession for Sandra Oh’s British spy character, Eve Polastri. The obsession is mutual and, in the first season, came in many flavors: The two are somewhere between a Tom and Jerry and a Mr. and Mrs. Smith, professional enemies who spend every waking hour thinking about each other. This season, the British actor Emerald Fennell has taken over as showrunner, replacing the show’s creator,
Phoebe Waller-Bridge
. In
her review of the beginning of Season 2 for The New York Times
, Margaret Lyons wrote, “Everything that was good about Season 1 is still good.”
UNFORGOTTEN
10 p.m. on PBS.
The third season of this mystery series begins with a construction crew stumbling on skeletal remains buried deep in English soil. (No, they don’t belong to
Richard III
.) The question of how they got there provides the next case for Cassie Stuart (Nicola Walker) and Sunil Khan (Sanjeev Bhaskar), the detectives at the center of this British series. Unlike most police procedurals, the show puts significant effort behind exploring the effect its central crimes have had on those who knew the victims. In a
positive review of the third season
for The Guardian, Sam Wollaston wrote that the show “doesn’t let you forget that at the core of a murder investigation is the saddest human tragedy.”
THE CHI
10 p.m. on Showtime.
Lena Waithe, a star of and writer for “Master of None” who won an Emmy for her writing, created a nuanced picture of Chicago in the debut season of this series. The show follows several characters in a neighborhood. At the start of the second season, Brandon (Jason Mitchell), a young man who struggled in Season 1 to pursue his passion for cooking while being pulled toward violence, opens a food truck. Soon after he starts serving up pork belly and polenta tacos, though, an injustice threatens to knock him back on a path toward violence. “My mission is to show these young black men are not born with a gun in their hand,” Waithe
told The Times last year
. “But I don’t paint us in a perfect light at all,” she also said. “My hope is that I can show us in an honest way. That’s it. Not bad. Not perfect. Just accurate.”

Good evening. Here’s the latest.
1. President Trump
is stepping up his push for tougher asylum rules.
His administration plans to make it much more difficult for
migrants crossing the southern border to win protection
in the U.S., including requiring proof by asylum seekers that they were persecuted back home.
Speaking from the Oval Office during a meeting with Egypt’s President, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, above, Mr. Trump denied that he would reinstate his family separation policy, while defending it as effective.
Mr. Trump has adopted a blunt new message in recent days: “Our country is full.” But demographers and economists say that
much of the nation
actually needs more people.
_____
2. Exit polls
show a dead heat in the Israeli election.
Both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his main rival, Benny Gantz, a retired lieutenant general and centrist, have claimed victory. If he wins a fourth consecutive term, Mr. Netanyahu would become Israel’s longest serving prime minister. He is also likely to guide the country to an ever sharper turn to the right.
Our live coverage is here
. We may not see numbers until tomorrow morning. Above, campaign posters featuring Mr. Netanyahu, left, and Mr. Gantz, center right, in Tel Aviv.
Readers told us what matters to them most
in this pivotal race.
_____
3. The Mueller report
will be delivered to Congress and the public “within a week.” Or at least some of it.
Attorney General William Barr pledged the prompt release under grilling by a House appropriations subcommittee that veered away from discussing the 2019 budget.
He said he would be
transparent about redactions in the report
, citing the need to exclude grand jury information, classified information and current investigations.
Separately,
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told lawmakers that White House lawyers and his department had discussed
a congressional request for President Trump’s tax returns
. The disclosure underscores the seriousness with which the president is taking the request.
_____
4.
It’s not a campaign.
It’s a “movement.”
That’s
the preferred framing
for the sprawling field of Democrats running for the presidential nomination. The language shift reflects a party trying to appease, and embolden, its activist base. “Thanks again for making this movement possible,” said a recent campaign email from Senator Elizabeth Warren, pictured above at a rally last month.
And be warned: The views of Democrats on social media often
bear little resemblance
to those of the wider Democratic electorate.
For his part, Bernie Sanders said he would
release 10 years worth of tax returns
by Monday. “If you write a best-selling book, you can be a millionaire, too,” he said.
_____
5. Measles
is spreading across the country.
New government data shows that four states — Florida, Indiana, Massachusetts and Nevada — have
all recorded their first measles cases for 2019
. The new infections take the national count to 465 confirmed cases this year, the second-greatest number of cases since 2000, when measles was declared eliminated in the U.S.
New York City has
declared a measles public health emergency
in parts of Brooklyn to contain the spread in ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods, where resistance to the measles vaccine runs high. Above, children outside a Brooklyn school where a measles outbreak occurred this year.
_____
6. The actress Lori Loughlin
and 15 other parents face new charges in the college admissions scandal. Above, Ms. Loughlin outside of federal court last week.
Federal prosecutors
added charges of mail fraud and money laundering
, following through on a threat to raise the stakes for parents who did not plead guilty to the original charges, mostly fraud. A dozen of the 33 parents accused in the case, including Felicity Huffman, have agreed to plead guilty.
Ms. Loughlin and her husband, Mossimo Giannulli, are accused of conspiring with a college consultant to pay $500,000 in bribes to get their daughters admitted to the University of Southern California as recruits to the women’s crew team, though neither of the girls actually participated in the sport.
_____
7. Last year,
they fell in the first round of the N.C.A.A.’s men’s basketball tournament. On Monday night, they were crowned champions.
Virginia’s trajectory has to count among
the most dramatic in sports
, with a series of closer-than-close contests, our columnist writes.
From the basketball court to the Augusta green: Patrick Reed, the defending Masters champion, has told his estranged family members to stay away, and
yet they keep popping up at tournaments
. He’ll begin trying to defend his title on Thursday.
_____
8.

“The Daily”
podcast has brought you stories from the border, provided our critics’ takes on cultural milestones and unpacked busy days in Washington.

And with spring holidays on the horizon, our reporter explored
the sweet success of spiraled ham
, even among boutique producers. We also have a
sprightly brisket for the Passover table
.

10. Finally,
forget the looming Brexit plank walk. Let’s talk about royal babies.
One in particular, actually. Prince Harry and Meghan Markel are expecting their first child in a few weeks. We answer
25 frequently asked questions
on “evewything you evew” wanted to know about “da royaw baby” — and some things you didn’t. Above, members of the royal family at Westminster Abbey in London last month.
From due date and line of succession to the baby’s last name and astrological sign, our baby-talking reporter Caity Weaver has you covered. Why do you care about this particular baby? There’s only one way to find out.

The Los Angeles Lakers held exit interviews with the media on Wednesday, fresh off a disappointing season and the drama of Tuesday night, when team president Magic Johnson abruptly stepped down before the final game.
""We had moments where we were really, really good and we had moments where we were really, really bad,"" forward Brandon Ingram said.
""Because of what went on throughout the schedule, which was crazy, I think that ultimately helps us out and brings us even closer for next year. I'm not sure who is going to return, but for the guys who are, I know they going to feel that feeling of like we could have won games.""
But much is up in the air a day after the Lakers ended with a 37-45 record and missed the playoffs for the sixth consecutive season. Who will run the team? Who will coach the team? Luke Walton, after his third season on the bench, did not meet with the media Wednesday.
""I think Luke did a hell of a job, with what he had, the cards he was dealt,"" point guard Rajon Rondo said. ""Guys fought every night.""
The Lakers, who pursued New Orleans Pelicans star Anthony Davis at the trading deadline, will want to make a big offseason splash, which could suit the desires of superstar LeBron James.
The Lakers were 20-14 and in fourth place in the Western Conference after beating the Golden State Warriors on Christmas Day, when James suffered a groin injury that cost him the next 17 games.
Ingram didn't play after March 2 and under underwent thoracic outlet decompression surgery after he was diagnosed with deep venous thrombosis, which involved a blood clot that caused shoulder pain.
Point guard Lonzo Ball didn't play after Jan. 19 because of a left ankle injury. He wore a black hat with the words ""Don't Forget Me"" to his media interview Wednesday.
""I think those two weeks before I got hurt, I kind of figured it out,"" said Ball, whose name has been mentioned in trade possibilities. ""I felt I was playing the basketball I was capable of playing and unfortunately I got hurt and couldn't come back.""
The other big question around Ball is whether he will continue to do business with his father, LaVar Ball, and the family's Big Baller Brand.
""We're still talking about it,"" Lonzo Ball said. ""Right now, I'm not really too focused on that. I'm more focused on just being healthy, getting right for the summer. We'll get around to it.""
Ball said he looked at James -- who signed a four-year, $154 million deal last offseason -- as a ""big brother.""
""It was a dream come true for me,"" Ball said of playing with James. ""Obviously, his IQ is off the charts, so he's not hard to play with at all.""

PHILADELPHIA — Max Kepler and Willians Astudillo hit consecutive homers, Eddie Rosario hit a three-run shot and the Minnesota Twins beat the Philadelphia Phillies 6-2 on Saturday.
Rhys Hoskins went deep for the Phillies, and Bryce Harper had two hits.
Both teams are off to 5-2 starts.
Making his second start since Tommy John surgery in 2017, Michael Pineda (1-0) allowed two runs and four hits, striking out five in five-plus innings for Minnesota.
Jake Arrieta (1-1) gave up three runs and five hits in seven innings.
Center fielder Byron Buxton threw out Harper trying to score on a flyout in the sixth to preserve Minnesota's one-run lead.
Rosario made it a four-run cushion when he hit one off the right field foul pole in the ninth against Seranthony Dominguez.
The Twins jumped ahead 3-0 in the third inning. Buxton hit a single, stole second, advanced to third on a groundout and scored on a wild pitch.
Kepler then blasted his second homer in two games way out to right-center, and Astudillo drove one out to left.
Hoskins connected in the fourth to cut it to 3-1.
Jean Segura led off Philadelphia's sixth with a single to chase Pineda. Harper ripped a double off lefty Adalberto Mejia, hustling into second with a headfirst dive. After Hoskins walked, Odubel Herrera's sacrifice fly got Philadelphia within a run. Cesar Hernandez followed with a fly to center. Harper tagged, but Buxton made a strong throw home. Harper leaped over the catcher, but Astudillo applied the tag for the final out.
Philadelphia loaded the bases with two outs in the eighth, but Taylor Rogers retired Hernandez on a grounder to first.
Harper, who struck out with a runner on third and one out in the first, got an infield hit with two outs in the eighth and finished 2 for 4.
THE ANSWER
Basketball Hall of Famer Allen Iverson, a Philadelphia fan favorite, threw out the first pitch. Wearing a No. 3 — his number with the 76ers — Phillies pinstriped jersey, Iverson tossed a perfect strike to the Phillie Phanatic. Iverson greeted Harper, fellow No. 3, before the game. The pair met Thursday night across the street when Harper rang the ceremonial bell before the 76ers played Milwaukee.
CRUZ SITS
Twins designated hitter Nelson Cruz wasn't in the lineup for the second straight game. He appeared in right field in only four games last year for Seattle.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Twins: Buxton was back in the starting lineup for the first time since colliding with a wall Tuesday.
Phillies: OF Roman Quinn (right oblique strain) was scheduled to play another rehab game at Class A Clearwater on Saturday. He was 1 for 3 with a double and a walk Thursday and didn't play Friday.
UP NEXT
RHP Jose Berrios (1-0, 1.84 ERA) starts for the Twins on Sunday and RHP Zach Eflin (1-0, 0.00) goes for the Phillies. Both pitchers are making their first appearance against their opponent.

ANCHORAGE — It’s not springtime now in Alaska, it’s “break-up” — the end of safe travel on ice.
And in an era of climate change, break-up has been coming too soon, especially this year. The ice has become unpredictable, creating new, sometimes deadly hazards and a host of practical problems that disrupt the rhythms of everyday life.
The ice roads that carry freight in winter and spring have been going soft prematurely. Hunters cannot ride safely to their spring camps. Sled-dog races have been canceled. People traveling on frozen rivers by A.T.V. or snowmobile are falling through; some have died. Rescuers trying to reach them have been stymied by thin ice.
[Read more about why March 2019 in Alaska was 20 degrees hotter than usual.]
Alaskans are not just accustomed to hard-frozen winters, they depend on them — for essential transportation, subsistence hunting, industry and recreation. Frozen rivers connect rural villages the way highways connect the rest of the country.
But Alaska is the fastest-warming state in America, heating up along with the rest of the Arctic at twice the global average rate, according to the
Fourth National Climate Assessment
. Springtime temperatures are averaging 2 to 5 degrees higher now than 50 years ago, and
record highs were set across the state in March
.
“I don’t know anyone in Alaska who questions whether things have changed,” said Brian Brettschneider, a climatologist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. “Everyone sees it. Everyone feels it.”
Mark Leary is part of a team that builds an ice road each winter along 200 miles of the Kuskokwim River, connecting 13,000 people in small communities in a region of Southwest Alaska that lacks ordinary roads.
When the ice road is open, trucks can haul supplies to the villages, and people can drive to Bethel,
the biggest town in the area
, for shopping and medical appointments. School basketball teams can travel to away games without having to fly in small planes.
“The river is our highway,” Mr. Leary said. “It’s everything to us.”
Later freeze-ups and earlier thaws over the last decade have kept the ice on the river from getting as thick as it once did, so his team has switched to using a lightweight plow that can safely clear thinner ice.
“The river is always teaching us,” he said. “The more respectful and observant you are, the more you learn.”
Mr. Leary, who is also a volunteer team leader with Bethel Search and Rescue, said poor ice quality was a persistent public safety concern. People drive snowmobiles or A.T.V.s over routes they have used for many years without thinking about the changing ice conditions, he said, and when people are drinking, they take more risks.
Five people have died falling through ice this spring in Mr. Leary’s region alone, including two on March 31.
The effects of climate change are amplified in Alaska because the warming ocean holds less sea ice, according to Rick Thoman, a climate researcher at the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Ice reflects sunlight, he said, while open water absorbs it, warming the air above. Decreasing snow cover is having a similar effect on land, he added.
Many people in rural Alaska supplement their food supply by hunting and fishing. Charles Wright, who lives in Tanana, a village on the Yukon River about 100 miles west of Fairbanks, has hunted geese and trapped beaver with his family since he was a boy.
The family aims to make the annual 30-mile journey to their spring hunting camp by snowmobile in mid-April, Mr. Wright said, but this year the ice is too thin. So they now must wait for the rivers to clear, and then hunt by boat.
“We used to be able to predict the weather and know what time to go out and do certain things,” Mr. Wright said.
He said he has had so many close calls snowmobiling on river ice that he wears a life jacket when he rides.
Vanishing sea ice is the issue for people in Kivalina, a finger-thin barrier island in the Chukchi Sea. Janet Mitchell, a former city administrator in Kivalina, said that when she was growing up, hunters would walk out on the sea ice
to find bearded seals sunning themselves.
These days, though, stable sea ice rarely freezes all the way to the shore, Ms. Mitchell said, so “now we have to hunt in the open water.” She said her nephews have learned to scan the sea from a boat for animals popping up in the waves.
Without sea ice to calm the water, Ms. Mitchell said, winter storms do more damage, eroding an island that is also shrinking because of rising sea levels. There has been talk of relocating
her village
to the mainland.
In Utqiagvik, the northernmost community in the United States, churches held services in late March to bless the crews who hunt bowhead whales,
a vital food source for the community
. Then the whalers began building a trail on the coastal sea ice between the village and the open water of the Arctic Ocean.
The ice looks decent this year, according to Frederick Brower, a fourth-generation whaling captain. But he said it was hard to find old ice left over from the previous winter, which used to be common. The migrating whales come north sooner when there is less sea ice, he said, so the villagers now hunt them two weeks earlier than they used to.
When they get a whale, the hunters haul it onto the ice, and scores of townspeople go out to the water’s edge to help break the carcass down. That’s when Mr. Brower worries.
“Not only are you concerned about ice thickness holding the bowhead,” which can weigh 30 tons, he said. “It’s when you get an influx of 300 people,” plus their snowmobiles.
The streets of Anchorage are clear for biking and the crocuses are blooming weeks sooner than usual this spring. A few weeks ago, Paxson Woelber, who runs an outdoor recreation website, was helping his
girlfriend
, Cori Graves, a photographer, with a bridalwear shoot out on the smooth, skater-friendly ice of Portage Lake south of the city when they had a serious scare.
A huge chunk of the Portage Glacier, seven stories high and 100 feet wide, broke off and fell into the lake, causing waves that rolled and heaved the ice where they were standing.
“We could see the swells coming,” Mr. Woelber said. “As they push up the ice, it kind of sprays water between the plates. The model was faced with the absurd prospect of fleeing the glacial calving event in a wedding dress.”
Philip Rode’s ice adventure was much dicier.
When the Bering Sea is frozen, he and other miners from Nome set up camp on the sea ice and dive beneath it to collect gold-bearing sediments. The ice usually stays solid until May, but in early March, while he was at a basketball game, he got the alarming news that it was breaking up.
He said that he and some colleagues dug their boat out of the snow, motored out to the ice raft where their camp was now adrift, and walked onto the ice to recover their equipment, only to see more slushy breaks open up between them and their boat. They couldn’t get back.
The miners had to be rescued by helicopter; by then the current had pushed their ice raft five miles from shore. “Had no one called it in,” Mr. Rode said, “we would have been at the mercy of the sea.”

A top seed, a past champion and two first-time visitors will play for the national title this weekend.
By
Marc Tracy
MINNEAPOLIS — Virginia, the only top seed remaining, will face Auburn, which is making its first appearance in the Final Four, in the first of two national semifinals of the N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament on Saturday. Michigan State, the 2000 champion, plays the newcomer Texas Tech in the second game.
No team is hotter than Auburn, which arrives at its first Final Four with a 12-game winning streak: four to end the regular season, four to win the Southeastern Conference tournament and four more in the N.C.A.A. tournament. (The Tigers could become only the second national champion, after Connecticut in 2011, to play 41 games.)
Bruce Pearl’s Tigers have done it by being among the best 3-point-shooting teams and by getting more of their points off 3-pointers than all but six teams in Division I. For that reason, the Tigers’ most impressive win was over second-seeded Kentucky in the regional final, precisely because they could barely buy a 3, going 7-for-23 from beyond the arc. They also won that day without their best big man, Chuma Okeke, who had sustained a season-ending knee injury a game earlier.
Sounds like a tough out, right?
Well. Virginia has the third-best 3-point defense in the country, even as its excellent offense, led by the wings Kyle Guy, Ty Jerome and De’Andre Hunter, and its Tony Bennett-branded, dead-last pace make maximizing points per possession against it essential.
If the Cavaliers sound tough to beat, well, only two teams have accomplished the feat: Duke, twice; and Florida State, which used its sheer size and athleticism to overpower Virginia in the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament. That is something Auburn will struggle to do without Okeke.
So, yeah, the Tigers have their work cut out for them.
Between two excellent teams, a balanced one should defeat the less-balanced one, right? The former describes the Spartans, who have a top-10 offense and a top-10 defense, whereas the latter is the Red Raiders, who, according to the KenPom rankings, have the country’s best defense but an offense that is merely excellent rather than superb.
But those are season-long figures. In the N.C.A.A. tournament, including against highly regarded Buffalo, a Michigan team with a typically stout defense and a Gonzaga juggernaut, Texas Tech has turned on the offensive jets, shooting 53.4 percent from the field compared with its season mark of 47.2 percent. The Red Raiders have done this while making 3-pointers at a slightly lower rate, which means a good game from deep likely makes Texas Tech almost unbeatable.
Coach Chris Beard’s squad will need to be about that to defeat Michigan State, which uses a smaller rotation than the average Tom Izzo squad but otherwise resembles his seven other Final Four teams in its balance and toughness.
Point guard Cassius Winston increasingly looks like the national player of the year (non-Zion Williamson category), having contributed 20 points on 19 shots, 10 assists and 4 steals in last weekend’s one-point win over Duke. The Spartans will need a similar kind of game from Winston (and similar playing time; in the regional semifinals and final combined, Winston sat for only the final minute of the first game) to get by Texas Tech.
