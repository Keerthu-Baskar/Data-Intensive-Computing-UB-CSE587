LISBON — Plans to reform and possible expand European club competition ran into opposition on Friday as the continent's leagues declared they were 'united' in their determination to protect domestic football.
The European Leagues umbrella group said it would take a more active role in influencing public opinion and shaping the future of football on the continent and reiterated its claim that fans prefer domestic league action to UEFA competition.
Meanwhile, the English Premier League, one of the European Leagues' 35 members, said its 20 clubs would ""vigorously defend"" it against any plans to impose a new calendar.
UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said on being re-elected in February that he would work with the European Club Association (ECA), which groups 232 of the region's biggest clubs, to ""design the club competitions of the future.""
The ECA, in turn, said it wanted more teams playing more matches in continental competitions.
European Leagues, which says it represents 900-plus clubs through its affiliates including ""those who are not normally playing European football"", said domestic football should remain the priority.
""Our main objective is to safeguard the domestic competitions and protect the domestic competitions if needed,"" its president Lars-Christer Olsson told a news conference.
""These are the most important to the fans, they are much more important than any international competitions.""
Olsson added: ""These are interesting times. When it comes to real issues, I am happy to see all leagues are united.""
Although UEFA has only just started discussing its plans, Olsson said it was important that the public knew what was happening.
""We have to make the views of the European Leagues known to everyone, not only stakeholders but also fans and the public so everyone knows what is going on and how we are preparing for the future club competitions,"" he said.
Olsson added that the last 10 years had been negative for domestic leagues as revenue from UEFA competition had increased the gap between the richest clubs and the rest.
The Premier League said that in a statement that it had ""significant concerns"" over reported plans to change the format and qualifying criteria for European tournaments.
""All clubs unanimously agreed it is inappropriate for European football bodies to create plans that would alter the structures, calendar and competitiveness of the domestic game and will work together to protect the Premier League,"" it said.
""We have a fantastic combination of competitive football and committed fans that we will vigorously defend,"" it continued, adding that allegiances and local rivalries were often passed down through generations.
The Premier League said it would ensure that ""European football bodies understand the importance of this, and their obligation to maintain the health and sustainability of domestic league football.""

(Reuters) - Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has urged Tottenham Hotspur full back Danny Rose not to let racism win by following through on his plan to walk away from football when his playing career ends.
England international Rose said on Thursday that he could not wait to leave football because he had had enough of the racism in the game and was frustrated by the response of the authorities to the abuse.
Rose was among several English players who were victims of offensive chanting in a Euro 2020 qualifier in Montenegro last month.
Guardiola, whose City team play Tottenham in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday, said Rose should stay in football and continue to fight racism from within the game.
""The best way to fight and combat this kind of terrible situation is fighting and being there every day - and of course (Rose) is an extraordinary footballer,"" Guardiola told a news conference on Friday.
""I will tell him when I see him next Tuesday.""
The chanting in Montenegro gave fresh impetus to the debate over whether the game's authorities are doing enough to tackle racism in soccer.
UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said this month that referees should stop matches when players have been subjected to racial abuse, while Rose's England team mate Raheem Sterling called for stiffer sanctions for fans who racially abuse players.

(Reuters) - Brazil's female footballers have made great strides in growing their domestic game but they lack the organisation to emulate the United States team and demand the same pay and conditions as men, defender Erika told Reuters on Tuesday.
The Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) this year obliged all first division clubs to create a women's side and are funding them directly, officials said.
But their income is still vastly inferior to their male counterparts and Erika said she is envious of the World Cup-winning U.S. squad, 28 of whom sued the U.S. Soccer Federation last month in a lawsuit that includes complaints about wages and working conditions.
""I think it is sensational what the U.S. players did,"" she said in a phone interview from Spain, the day after Brazil lost 1-0 to Scotland in a friendly, their ninth consecutive defeat.
""We have the strength to do the same in Brazil but we don't have courage or the (people) to guide us.
""The U.S. women are a gigantic force. They have won a lot and that makes it easier for them to fight for what they want. We need to be united but we haven't managed that.""
Erika blamed that lack of unity on geography. Most of the Brazilian women play their club football outside the country and get together only for international games, which makes organising more difficult.
""I think distance is a problem,"" the 31-year-old Corinthians defender said. ""The principal players are based outside the country and that makes it more complicated, if they were all able to be here it would make it easier to develop, and we'd be stronger.
""Sadly, we still think individually.""
The Brazilian players nevertheless looked at recent big crowds for women's matches in Spain and Italy – a world record 60,739 people turned out to see Atletico Madrid take on Barcelona last month - as indicative of the growing power of the female game.
Women's football has gained a higher profile this year in Brazil, with the CBF paying to help women's teams compete in the 16-team first division and also setting up a second division and under-18 league.
""Without a doubt here has been a huge growth and there is a long way to go,"" Erika said.
""I want to see the kind of crowds we saw in Madrid in Brazil. It inspires us.""
Brazil are one of 24 teams who will take part in the Women's World Cup in France from June 7-July 7.

LAS VEGAS — Former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville is joining the Republican race to win back the Senate seat from Democrat Doug Jones in 2020.
Tuberville is set to announce his candidacy Saturday, according to a person familiar with Tuberville's decision. This person wasn't authorized to publicly discuss Tuberville's plans and spoke on condition of anonymity.
Republicans are trying to recapture the seat that was held by Republican Jeff Sessions, who was President Donald Trump's first attorney general.
Jones, a former U.S. attorney, defeated ex-state Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore in a special election in 2017 after the Republican candidate was accused of sexual misconduct with teenagers. Moore denied the allegations.
Already in the GOP race is Bradley Byrne, a congressman.
The primary is set for March 3, 2020.

The Jets, a football team that has been an N.F.L. punch line for years, asked a comedian to be the master of ceremonies at a loud, flashy event to unveil the team’s new uniforms on Thursday.
J.B. Smoove, who has been a suffering Jets fan for decades, stood on the stage at Gotham Hall in Manhattan and urged the star players who were modeling the new threads to wear them proudly and become accustomed to them.
“Get comfortable,” Smoove said to quarterback Sam Darnold. “These are your damn pajamas.”
When a team finishes last in three consecutive seasons, and has not made the playoffs in eight, sometimes the best approach is to make cosmetic changes and laugh about it. This, after all, is a team that counts “The Butt Fumble” among its most memorable moments of the last several years, so maybe a change was in order.
Yet, aside from Smoove, the Jets were very serious — even solemn, at times — about this new endeavor, treating the unveiling of the new uniform at an event space on Broadway much the way a major tech company introduces a fancy new device.
There was a D.J., flashing lights, a celebratory video, cheerleaders and, of course, fans chanting J-E-T-S. It was as close as the Jets get to a parade these days.
They said that work on the new uniforms began in 2014, which is a long time for anything to do with fashion. Christopher Johnson, the chairman and chief executive, quipped that it took longer to come up with the new duds than it did to build the team’s current stadium in New Jersey.
But he noted that it was the perfect moment for a new look. The Jets, who were 4-12 last year, have a new coach, Adam Gase; a talented, second-year quarterback in Darnold; and several other new players, including the star running back Le’Veon Bell. The new uniforms, he said hopefully, signaled a new era for Gang Green.
There was also talk of “brand identity” and a “refreshed logo,” the kind of marketing jargon that all teams use when they hope fans will buy items with the new look. (Within minutes of the unveiling, the new uniforms were featured on the home page of the N.F.L.’s website and its shop.) There was even a reference to work on the new design being “an extraordinary process,” as if it included some historic feat of engineering.
“You will see the vision behind the process, including the thought, energy and excitement it took to make this change a reality,” Johnson said. “Our fans asked for this change. So did our players. It was time for a new uniform, time for a new look.”
That look that fans allegedly asked for consists of a brand-new color (if that is possible) that the Jets call Gotham Green. Besides sounding like a name for a small park in Manhattan, the tint looks like a slight variation of the green it replaced.
A more significant change is the new black uniform, with a hue dubbed Stealth Black, that all the players seemed to like a lot.
Gone are the trademark vertical stripes on the shoulders. They were swapped out for pointy horizontal stripes that come around the shoulders and aim underneath the neckline, toward the center N.F.L. logo, which sits above the words “New York” in capital letters. It is becoming ever more popular for teams to put their nicknames on jerseys, but the city of origin is not common.
The pants, both white (make that Spotlight White) and green, have the same kind of pointy stripes made popular when the Denver Broncos changed their uniform design in 1997. The straight dual stripes that gave the previous Jets uniforms a classic flavor are gone, and with them goes the traditional old logo, too.
The Jets traded in the white helmet and the green NY logo that dates back, with slight variations, to the days of Joe Namath and Don Maynard. (Broadway Joe, by the way, was right there on Broadway on Thursday to sanction all the changes.)
The new helmet is shiny (Gotham) green with a white logo that has the word “Jets” above a small football, a nod to the football in the old logo. (The Jets and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are the only teams with a football in their helmet logos.)
When the players, including Jamal Adams, Leonard Williams, Quincy Enunwa and Darnold, were brought on stage to showcase the new look, they danced and posed and later echoed the team line that the new look is bold, innovative and fresh.
“I think that a lot of old school people are going to have it grow on them,” Enunwa said and added, “It feels like a new team, in a way.”
That is the point. But the Jets are only the most recent N.F.L. team to change uniforms. Some have had more success than others. The Patriots changed their uniforms in 2000, and in their second season in a darker blue color, they won the first of six Super Bowls in them.
“I think that’s just a coincidence,” Darnold said. “But no, maybe it’s a telltale sign. If we don’t play well, the uniforms are going to look crummy. If we play well, then they are going to look awesome.”

SYDNEY — Sydney FC's top of the table A-League clash against Perth Glory this month has been moved away from the Sydney Cricket Ground after a furore over the 'dangerous' pitch at the iconic stadium during the weekend.
Australia's players' union joined Melbourne Victory boss Kevin Muscat in slamming the SCG pitch after visiting midfielder Terry Antonis suffered a knee injury during a match against Sydney FC on Saturday night.
Head of Leagues Greg O'Rourke said that although the Football Federation Australia (FFA) considered the surface to be ""playable and safe"", the April 18 fixture would be moved to Jubilee Oval ""in the best interests of all stakeholders"".
""The SCG's (cricket) wicket block ... compromises the uniformity of the field for football in particular,"" he said in a joint statement with Sydney FC and the SCG.
Antonis fell to the ground untouched on the edge of the cricket square during a 2-1 loss for his side in a clash between the last two Australian champions.
Professional Footballers Australia (PFA) called for an independent investigation into how the match was allowed to go ahead given the 'deplorable state' of the pitch, which the body said posed a clear danger to player safety.
The SCG is being used by soccer, rugby league and rugby union teams in addition to hosting its usual cricket and Australian Rules matches while the neighbouring Sydney Football Stadium (SFS) is re-built.
Some 3,000 square metres of turf were relaid after the surface was torn up during a rugby union match last month.
Sydney FC travel to city rivals Western Sydney Wanderers next weekend but are assured of still being in second place behind Perth, who are six points clear at the top of the A-League, going into the match the following week.
""This is a hugely important fixture with first playing second and we want the narrative to be about the football,"" Sydney FC Chief Executive Danny Townsend said.
""This is a decision made in the viewing interest of members and supporters.""
The SCG has hosted test cricket since 1882 and was the venue for hundreds of rugby league and union matches before the SFS was completed in 1988.

KUALA LUMPUR — Oman will face a race against time to build a stadium large enough to satisfy FIFA requirements if football's governing body decides to expand the Qatar 2022 World Cup finals and asks the Sultanate to co-host the enlarged tournament.
Oman Football Association president Salem Said Salem Al Wahaibi told Reuters that FIFA president Gianni Infantino has sounded out the country's government over their ability to co-host the event should it be expanded from 32 to 48 teams.
But with Muscat's Sultan Qaboos Stadium falling short of minimum capacity requirements for the World Cup, the Omanis would need to overhaul their biggest stadium to be considered a viable host.
""Mr Infantino visited us and he gave a proposal to the government and they are still thinking about it,"" said Al Wahaibi on the sidelines of the Asian Football Confederation's congress on Saturday.
""They haven't come to a decision yet, but it's not a federation decision. We have some issues. We don't have a stadium for 40,000, so if we take it we will be working against time. That is the first enemy for us. There are so many issues and it won't be as easy as it looks.
""Our stadium, the maximum capacity we have is 29,000, so in two years can we get that? That's the question for the government, plus the other logistics. I'm optimistic but let's see.""
Qatar was awarded the rights to host a 32-team World Cup in December 2010, but after becoming FIFA president in 2016 Infantino has been open to the idea of expanding the tournament to accommodate 16 additional teams.
The 2026 edition is already slated to feature 48 nations and Infantino is keen to bring forward the enlarged format by four years.
""Sharing a few games with a few of the neighbouring countries is, of course, an option as well to make it a true World Cup for the world and for the whole Gulf region,"" he said on Saturday.
""It's something to discuss, something to think about and something we are working on with Qatar and together with all of you and, of course, it would be a nice achievement if the first World Cup with 48 teams would be played in Asia.""
FIFA DECISION
A decision on the proposal to expand the World Cup is expected at the FIFA congress in Paris in June.
Qatar has said it will not take a decision on expanding the tournament until it sees the details of a feasibility study from FIFA.
The Omanis, meanwhile, believe hosting matches in 2022 would invigorate the sport in a country that has never qualified for the World Cup or accommodated a major football event.
""FIFA wanted the approval of the two countries - Kuwait and Oman - and then the congress will discuss if it goes from 32 to 48 and then we will see,"" said Al Wahaibi.
""But it would be marvellous and it would give us a boost and put Oman on the global map of football.
""It would be a gift to the young generation and not in my lifetime have we ever had this chance, it would be history for my country that Oman would host some games of the World Cup in 2022.""

SYDNEY — Australia's players' union has joined Melbourne Victory boss Kevin Muscat in denouncing the ""dangerous"" Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) pitch after a player suffered a knee injury during an A-League match against Sydney FC on Saturday night.
Midfielder Terry Antonis fell to the ground untouched on the edge of the cricket square during a 2-1 loss for his side in a clash between the last two Australian champions.
The iconic ground is being used for football codes while the neighbouring Sydney Football Stadium is re-vamped and has already attracted criticism after it was torn up during a rugby match.
""It was dangerous, first and foremost,"" Muscat told reporters.
""To ask players to come and work under those conditions is unacceptable. It might be a serious injury as a result from it. And for players to go out onto that, whatever it's called, is a disgrace.""
Professional Footballers Australia (PFA) called for an independent investigation into how the match was allowed to go ahead given the ""deplorable state"" of the pitch, which the body said posed a ""clear danger"" to ""player safety"".
""The players confirmed with us last night that they were not consulted at any stage on whether or not the match should proceed, notwithstanding the clear issues that the pitch presented to their livelihoods,"" chief executive John Didulica said in a statement.
""The PFA will ... recommend two clear resolutions for adoption. Firstly, that FFA immediately commission an independent investigation into the process undertaken to approve last night's match as being fit for play.
""Secondly, endorse a motion that players will no longer play on surfaces unacceptably compromised by a cricket wicket.""
Sydney FC, whose victory kept them second in the A-League, are scheduled to host league leaders Perth Glory at the ground on April 18.
""The pitch clearly wasn't up to the standards required for professional football and we are working with the SCG Trust and FFA to assess its suitability to host our game against Perth in 11 days' time,"" said Sydney FC chief executive Danny Townsend.
""All options are on the table, including moving the game, and those discussions are already underway.""
Some 3,000 square metres of turf at the ground were replaced last month after huge divots came up during a rugby union match between the New South Wales Waratahs and Queensland Reds.
The Sydney Roosters rugby league team have also used the ground and the various codes have varied the layout of the pitch in order to mitigate the impact of the three different types of grass on the surface.
The SCG has hosted test cricket since 1882 and was the venue for hundreds of rugby league and union matches before the SFS was completed in 1988. It has also been the home of the Sydney Swans Australian Rules team since 1982.
Didulica said the presence of a cricket wicket on a playing surface presented ""an unreasonable danger to the health and safety of footballers"".
""It remains the view of the PFA that players are under no obligation to participate in matches when such risks are present. This includes the SCG.""

Football Federation Australia (FFA) will meet with Sydney FC and the Sydney Cricket Ground management on Monday to discuss the condition of the playing surface.

""Whilst FFA understands the current demands on the surface...it appears that the needs of our code around surface condition may not be able to be met, despite the best intentions of all parties.""

(Reuters) - Crystal Palace winger Andros Townsend has hailed Tottenham Hotspur full back Danny Rose's bravery for speaking out against racism and urged more players to join calls for the game's authorities to take more decisive action on racist abuse.
England international Rose said last week that he could not wait to leave football because he had had enough of the racism in the game and was frustrated by the response of the authorities to the abuse.
""Danny's a very brave man for coming out, being so honest and speaking the truth. Obviously I sympathise with him; we all support him,"" Townsend told reporters after Palace beat Newcastle United 1-0 in the Premier League on Saturday.
""Luckily, so far, I haven't experienced racism but I know Danny has on more than one occasion. He's experienced it with the England Under-21s and the seniors in Montenegro the other day.
""We need more players like Danny to come out, be honest and speak the truth, to say what they really feel. Danny's an incredible person; hopefully the system can help Danny and he can enjoy his football again.""
Juventus teenager Moise Kean also appeared to suffer racist abuse from the stands in a match at Cagliari in Serie A last week and there were more incidents in England this weekend.
Second-tier Wigan Athletic released a statement in support of Nathan Byrne after the defender was sent an abusive message on Twitter on Saturday, while Brentford confirmed a fan had been arrested at their ground for a racially-aggravated offence.
""Racism's crept back into our game a little bit, which is not great so we need Danny and the young lad at Juventus (Kean) to speak out because that will force action,"" Townsend added.
""I don't know why racism's still going on. We've got to move on in football and kick it out as much as we can. Hopefully the relevant organisations will do their best to stamp it out... They're working their very hardest to stamp it out once and for all.""

Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, has asked the prosecutor who charged him with solicitation of prostitution to turn over “evidence materially favorable” to his case.
The request, made by Mr. Kraft’s lawyers, is the latest salvo in a high-profile fight over two misdemeanors that allege that Mr. Kraft paid for sex in late January at a massage parlor in Jupiter, Fla. While he does not deny being at the massage parlor, Mr. Kraft insists that he did nothing illegal, and that much of the evidence being used against him was improperly obtained by the police.
Mr. Kraft has not accepted a plea deal from the Palm Beach County state attorney, Dave Aronberg, because it would have obligated him to admit that prosecutors would win the case if it went to trial. Since then, his legal team has filed a number of motions to keep private and suppress evidence in the case, including surveillance video of Mr. Kraft inside the massage parlor. Mr. Kraft’s lawyers contend that the police knew that no human trafficking occurred inside the massage parlor, yet told a judge that it was in fact going on as a way to obtain a search warrant and install cameras inside the building.
In a letter sent to Mr. Aronberg on Wednesday, Mr. Kraft’s lawyers asked for information on all people who were secretly recorded inside the massage parlor but who were not charged with a crime. The lawyers also want “all information casting doubt on any claim that those working at the Spa were involved in or victims of human trafficking.”
The letter includes a footnote that says that the state attorney’s office “has already confirmed and conceded that there is no evidence of human trafficking.”
Asked if the state attorney’s office would provide the requested evidence, a spokesman for Mr. Aronberg’s office noted that there was a hearing on the matter on Friday.
Mr. Kraft’s lawyers have asked for the evidence by the end of Friday.
On Friday, the two sides will also discuss a motion filed by news media companies, including The New York Times, to oppose Mr. Kraft’s request that video surveillance footage and other evidence be kept private.

BURNLEY, England — There are instances in a club's history that can transform the mood and break barriers and as Manchester United prepare to face Barcelona in Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final, the class of 2019 were reminded about one such breakthrough moment.
Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's assistant Mike Phelan was part of the United team which beat Barca in the 1991 European Cup Winners' Cup -- ending a 23-year wait for a second European title after their famous European Cup win in 1968.
It was just the second trophy won by manager Alex Ferguson at United following the FA Cup triumph the previous season and the biggest prize since their last English league title in 1967.
In beating the Spanish giants in Rotterdam, thanks to two goals from Welsh striker Mark Hughes, United were suddenly back in the big time.
""It was a great occasion, the excitement and preparation that went into that as a player and then getting over to Rotterdam and preparing to play what were the favourites at that time, Barcelona with Johann Cruyff as manager,"" Phelan told Reuters in an interview.
Barca had the great Dutch defensive midfielder Ronald Koeman and the brilliant Danish forward Michael Laudrup, to compliment their Spanish core, including striker Julio Salinas.
But United, overwhelmingly English with a sprinkling of Welsh, Irish and Scottish talent, triumphed thanks to the goals of the former Barca striker Hughes.
""The game is like a blip but it is the time before and after the game that I remember,"" says Phelan who recalls the massive following of United fans in the Dutch city and the strong characters in Ferguson's dressing room.
The likes of Bryan Robson, Steve Bruce, Gary Pallister, Paul Ince, Clayton Blackmore and Brian McClair made up a team that was the true start of the Ferguson era.
""We knew we had created another moment in history for the club – it was terrific. It was also a push towards better things – it gave us a hunger to know that we could compete again at that level and we definitely moved into another territory where we continually won things,"" he said.
WONDERFUL STRIKE
Indeed, United were soon dominating English football and that success was to bring them up against Barca again in European competition.
Phelan was on the coaching staff in 2008, when United won a cagey, tactical two-legged Champions League semi-final encounter with Barca thanks to a wonderful strike from distance by Paul Scholes in the second leg at Old Trafford.
That set up the victory over Chelsea, on penalties, in the final in Moscow, as United won their second Champions League under Ferguson, following their memorable 1999 triumph against Bayern Munich -- at Barca's Nou Camp stadium.
But there are less positive memories from the two most recent clashes with the Spanish club -- a 2-0 defeat in the 2009 final and a 3-1 reverse in the 2011 decider when Pep Guardiola's former side again dominated.
""I think they were the best team in football at that time and led by an extremely good, up and coming coach, who has gone on to do even better,"" said Phelan.
""We were well beat, we had to take that on the chin. You try to be competitive – but our best wasn’t good enough,"" he added.
Barca are again favourites to reach the last four but Solksjaer's side have already shown, in the previous round, that they can overcome the odds.
United came back from 2-0 down to beat Paris St Germain after the first-leg to go through with a thrilling 3-1 win in the French capital and Phelan knows the team will have to repeat many of the qualities they showed in that game.
“We felt if anyone could do it – Manchester United could. The players embraced the whole thing. It was a real good feeling after the game, to know that the belief was there and that Manchester United can still create these moments,"" said Phelan.
""We got the reaction from the fans and the media which was great – it has gone down as a great night in football. Hopefully we can bottle it.
""With Ole and this new mindset we can produce some terrific performances.""
Standing in their way is Lionel Messi -- a goalscorer in both those lost finals.
""He is now more mature than he has ever been and he is still doing the things that he is really good at,"" said Phelan.
""At that time he was part of a good group of players, I think now it is a little bit different in that he is more of an individual player for Barcelona, the stand-out player, whereas 10 years ago he was in there with Iniesta and Xavi and these types of players, who were exceptionally talented players.
""They just took football to a new level, a different dimension, extremely efficient and clinical but they had a maestro at the heart of it – when he turns up he is good enough to win a game on his own.""

MEXICO CITY — Diego Maradona has been fined for dedicating a recent victory by his Mexican club to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, Mexico's football federation said on Monday.
The Argentine great, who coaches Dorados de Sinaloa, had dedicated a 3-2 win over Tampico Madero to Maduro and Venezuela in a news conference at the end of last month.
The body said in a statement that Maradona had been fined an unspecified sum for violating the federation's code of ethics which mandates political neutrality.
Maradona had said he was dedicating the victory to Maduro and Venezuelans caught up in an economic crisis. He also criticized U.S. President Donald Trump.

The Cleveland Browns, still busy retooling this offseason, are expected to sign quarterback Garrett Gilbert and safety Morgan Burnett on Friday, according to Cleveland.com.
Gilbert became available when the Alliance of American Football suspended operations earlier this week. The former sixth-round pick of the Los Angeles Rams had led the AAF with 2,152 passing yards and 13 touchdowns this season, playing for the Orlando Apollos.
He would compete for the back up spot to Baker Mayfield with the Browns.
Burnett was released by the Pittsburgh Steelers on Monday. The Steelers converted Burnett to dime cornerback during his one season in Pittsburgh, but the former Green Bay Packers veteran is hoping to return to safety.
Burnett, 30, is expected to sign a two-year deal, according to the report.

MINNEAPOLIS — Virginia junior guard Kyle Guy is comfortable shooting in the driveway or the gym. He got up shots at Harlem's Rucker Park and now can say he's splashed a few in a football stadium, too.
""As a shooter, obviously, you have to be confident in yourself, and your teammates have to be confident in you, and with that confidence, it doesn't matter where you're shooting,"" said Guy, who put up 25 points and made five huge 3-pointers to keep Virginia in the West Region final against Purdue. ""You could be shooting at Rucker Park in Harlem, or you could be shooting in a football stadium. You just have to have confidence. Obviously, it's very nice that we get to practice here twice, so we can kind of get a feel for it. But when the ball is tipped, it doesn't matter what the backdrop is. It's just we prepared for this, and we're going to be ready.""
The Cavaliers, the only No. 1 seed to survive and reach Minneapolis, were the second team on the practice court Friday, following Auburn. Neither team looked to be bothered by the massive arena during open practice sessions at U.S. Bank Stadium.
Virginia took a team trip to Rucker Park -- the famous outdoor court across from the old Polo Grounds at 155th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard in the Harlem neighborhood recently revisited in the Kyrie Irving flick ""Uncle Drew"" -- while in New York last season. Guy, a 21-year-old from Indianapolis who picked Virginia over Cal and Indiana, is also preparing for another big day off the court. He and his bride to be became a topic of conversation Thursday, when Guy said he was told he couldn't register for his upcoming wedding by the NCAA.
NCAA president Mark Emmert said the story was not accurate. On Friday, the NCAA further clarified that Guy can, in fact, have a wedding registry but fans are not allowed to send him gifts. Longtime girlfriend Alexa Jenkins and Guy will restore their registry after the Final Four.
To extend their trip to Monday night, the Cavaliers are counting on Guy to deliver big in the national semifinal matchup with Auburn.
""I've done a really good job this year of never hanging my head whenever I'm hitting or missing,"" Guy said. ""To see them go down was good.""
Head coach Tony Bennett said one of the keys for Virginia against Auburn will be defending the Tigers' 3-point barrage. Virginia (28.7 percent) is among the best in the nation defending the 3, but Auburn averages 30.1 attempts per game.
""We just have to get to the shooters,"" Virginia sophomore De'Andre Hunter said. ""We practice it every day. We have to get to them quick, possibly run them off their line and make them make plays. It's going to be a collective defensive effort.""

KIEV — The two remaining candidates in Ukraine's presidential race underwent televised drug and alcohol tests on Friday, capping a week in which they traded jibes in tit-for-tat social media videos and goaded each other to agree to a live policy debate.
President Petro Poroshenko is facing Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a comedian with no political experience who plays a fictional president in a TV series, in a run-off on April 21 after neither obtained a majority of votes in the first round last Sunday.
Zelenskiy won nearly twice as many votes as Poroshenko, but the incumbent is fighting back by painting his rival as a lightweight who would put Ukraine's security at risk.
The comedian had demanded they both be tested for drugs after he accepted Poroshenko's challenge for a policy debate in an apparent attempt to up the ante in their rivalry.
Early on Friday, Zelenskiy, 41, was shown in a livestream on his Facebook page undergoing a blood test at a private laboratory.
""I took a blood test. They pumped all sorts of blood out of me. But thank God, I have enough of it. Young blood,"" he told reporters afterwards.
An hour later, several television channels broadcast live footage of Poroshenko, 53, having his blood drawn by a medic in red scrubs in a room inside Kiev's main football stadium.
Poroshenko, 53, submitted blood, hair and urine samples to four different laboratories, said Volodymyr Yary, the chief doctor at a Kiev state hospital. He announced that the preliminary results from Poroshenko's test showed that ""no psychoactive substance was found.""
Poroshenko goaded Zelenskiy for not accepting his invitation to have the tests done at the stadium alongside him.
""I'm at the stadium today,"" Poroshenko told reporters. ""Volodymyr Oleksandrovych, as I understand it, was not. I came, but you didn't. No matter, I am sure that he will pick up the courage and come here and the debate will happen.""
On Wednesday, Zelenskiy accepted Poroshenko's challenge to take part in a policy debate but set his own conditions, including that it be held at the football stadium.
Poroshenko released another video overnight accusing Zelenskiy of setting many preconditions as a way of avoiding the debate altogether.
Asked after Friday's drugs tests why he had not accepted Poroshenko's request to take the test at the stadium, Zelenskiy said: ""There is no laboratory there. It was a very strange invitation.""
He also said he would receive his results in three days.
""We will show you the results. Everything is done officially,"" he said.
No date has been set for the debate between the two candidates. In the video posted online overnight, Poroshenko told his rival: ""Man up, come to the debates. We agreed on the stadium, I am waiting.""

MINNEAPOLIS — Slap the floor, bend those knees and get both hands up.
This national championship game is going to be a clinic on defense.
Virginia and Texas Tech are the last two teams alive in the NCAA Tournament, and they're in the final because they barely let their opponents breathe when possessing the ball.
Two of the three best defenses in the nation will meet for the title on Monday night, the first appearance in the final for each program.
Virginia stunned Auburn 63-62, when Kyle Guy sank three free throws with 0.6 seconds left after a late foul call. Then Texas Tech grinded past Michigan State 61-51, buoyed by 22 points from Matt Mooney and bolstered by coach Chris Beard's smothering defensive approach.
No matter the number of shots made, though, the trophy will be lifted and the confetti will be dropped at U.S. Bank Stadium, where 72,711 fans packed the 3-year-old football facility for the semifinal games on Saturday night.

LONDON — Two English second-tier clubs have condemned racist abuse of players following Saturday's games.
Brentford said it ""utterly condemns discrimination"" after a season-ticket holder was arrested following an allegation of abuse by Derby midfielder Duane Holmes.
The incident happened late in the League Championship match after Holmes was substituted in the 74th minute. The game at Griffin Park in west London ended 3-3.
Derby manager Frank Lampard says ""Duane's upset with the situation. It's not what we want to see in life, not just in football.""
In a separate case, Wigan reported a racist message sent to defender Nathan Byrne on Twitter to the police and said ""we find this behavior abhorrent.""
Byrne posted a screenshot on his Twitter account of a message he received following Wigan's 2-2 draw with Bristol City at Ashton Gate.
Anti-racism group Kick It Out says it will be ""liaising with the relevant authorities and offering support to clubs and players involved.""

RIO DE JANEIRO — The 2020 Copa America will mark a tournament revamp, with six teams beginning the campaign in a north zone in Colombia and six playing in a south zone in co-hosts Argentina, the South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL) said on Wednesday.
Argentina will be in the southern group, alongside Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia and an as yet undisclosed guest.
Brazil will feature in the northern group with Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru and another invited nation.
The teams will play each other once in their groups, and the top four sides in each group will then qualify for the quarter-finals. The final is to be played in Argentina.
The changes are part of a widespread attempt to revitalize South American club and international competitions and bring them more into line with Europe.
CONMEBOL have abandoned their six-decades long tradition of playing the Copa Libertadores final on a home-and-away basis, and will this year play the final at a neutral ground for the first time, much like the Champions League.
Next year's Copa America will be the fourth in six years. Officials want the tournament to be played at the same time as the European Championship, Europe's equivalent.

(Reuters) - Crystal Palace goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey was cleared of making a Nazi salute by the English Football Association (FA) on Friday.
The Wales international was charged with an 'aggravated breach' of the rules governing player conduct in January after being pictured with his right arm in the air in a photo posted on Instagram by Palace team mate Max Meyer.
Hennessey denied the charge, taking to Twitter to explain that he had been calling out and waving to attract the attention of the person behind the camera when the picture was taken.
""I'm delighted that the FA have found me not guilty of this charge,"" Hennessey said in a statement on Palace's website.
The photograph prompted an outcry on social media and the FA charged the 32-year-old with a breach of its rules relating to abusive, insulting or improper conduct and bringing the game into disrepute.
""This was a genuinely innocent moment, which appeared to be something completely different when captured on camera,"" Hennessey added.
""I want to state for the record that I abhor all forms of racism, fascism, anti-Semitism or discrimination of any kind.""

(Reuters) - Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe says it hurts to see his side playing with such a lack of cohesion and he plans to carry out a full review of their performances after Saturday's 3-1 home loss to Burnley saw them drop to 13th in the Premier League.
Bournemouth, who have one win in their last nine games, are still 10 points clear of the final relegation spot currently occupied by Cardiff City but Howe is determined to get the side back to playing their own brand of football.
""You are looking week in, week out, to see a clear identity, a clear way of playing, knowing you are improving in every game,"" Howe told reporters after the game.
""But in recent weeks we haven't seen the clear philosophy we want and that hurts me more than anything. We are going to have to review everything we do.
""Very few times have I felt like this during my management career when I've looked at a team and not been able to see what we've worked on. We're going through one of those phases at the moment where we look a bit disjointed.""

BARCELONA — La Liga leaders Barcelona beat Atletico Madrid 2-0 on Saturday to move 11 points clear at the top, while Real Madrid scraped a 2-1 win over Eibar.
Here are five talking points from the weekend in La Liga:
GRIEZMANN'S BAD DECISION
Last year Antoine Griezmann starred in a documentary called 'The Decision', in which he revealed he was snubbing an offer from Barcelona to stay at Atletico Madrid.
As the Catalans put Atletico to the sword on Saturday to go 11 points clear at the top in the title race, the Frenchman may be starting to rue the choice he made.
Griezmann's Atletico have nothing to play for in the remainder of the season, while Barcelona are setting their sights on an historic third treble.
The Atletico forward would have been perfect on the left of Barcelona's attack, an ideal foil for Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi, whose goals sunk Atletico at the Nou Camp.
CAZORLA CRUSHED
Santi Cazorla has endured many tough moments in an injury-hit career, but the Villarreal veteran was at his lowest ebb on Sunday.
The playmaker missed a last-minute penalty, firing down the middle, with Real Betis goalkeeper Pau Lopez catching the ball, when he could have equalised.
Real Betis won 2-1 and the result left Villarreal level on points with Real Valladolid, 17th, but below by one place as they have a worse head-to-head record.
Cazorla was seen standing distraught in the corner of a room at the Benito Villamarin stadium after the game, utterly inconsolable.
""Nobody can take this feeling of guilt away from me, but I will get up for my team mates, and the whole Villarreal family,"" Cazorla said on Twitter on Monday.
With seven games to go, the magician has time to make amends and keep his side in the top flight.
SUPPORT FOR CAPARROS
Sevilla's comfortable 2-0 win at Real Valladolid on Sunday was put on the back-burner by coach Joaquin Caparros's sad revelation after the game, explaining he is suffering from chronic leukaemia.
""I have caught it early and can live a normal life. I am not receiving any treatment. I want to enjoy my work,"" explained the 63-year-old coach, in charge until the end of the season at the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan.
The football world was quick to offer its support to Caparros.
""In this game against cancer you will not fight with just 11 players, you have us at your disposition too,"" former Sevilla coach Michel Gonzalez said on Twitter.
""This illness doesn't know who it's up against, an insatiable fighter.""
Other La Liga clubs, including Real Betis, Valencia and Athletic Bilbao sent the coach messages of support.
BENZEMA RISES ABOVE
Real Madrid's season has largely been a torturous affair but one player has risen head and shoulders above the rest, staking his case to head Zinedine Zidane's new project next season.
Karim Benzema is in the form of his career and while Los Blancos struggled against Eibar on Saturday, the Frenchman was at his vibrant best.
Benzema had two goals disallowed and hit the woodwork, but scored two more which did count to earn Madrid three points and deny Eibar a first win at the Santiago Bernabeu.
Madrid will make big changes in the close season but Benzema has proven he is capable of leading the line.
THE GETAFE GRIND
If Getafe reach the Champions League next season it will be a remarkable achievement for the tiny club based in Madrid's suburbs.
However, the football world can consider itself warned - they won't necessarily be fun to watch.
They eked out a 1-0 win over Athletic Bilbao on Saturday to consolidate their position in fourth.
Jose Bordalas's side play with little flair but are extremely well-drilled and are grinding their way towards Europe.

ZURICH — AC Milan have been reported by UEFA investigators over an alleged new breach of European soccer's break-even rule known as Financial Fair Play (FFP), the governing body said on Wednesday.
UEFA said the investigation found that Milan had ""failed to comply with the break-even requirement"" for the 2018/19 season, its most recent monitoring period, and that the case had been passed to its financial adjudicators.
There was no immediate comment from the Serie A club.
Under UEFA regulations, any club spending more than the revenue it generates faces possible sanctions, including, in certain circumstances, a ban from competitions run by UEFA.
UEFA said that the referral was not connected to the previous case against the seven-times European champions which saw them banned and then reprieved on appeal.
Milan were given a one-season ban from European football in June after UEFA ruled that the club had not complied with FFP rules for the previous monitoring period.
Milan appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) which overturned the ban in July, accepting the club’s argument that its finances had improved after an ownership change.
Milan were then able to take part in this season's Europa League, which they exited in the group stage, while UEFA was ordered by CAS to find an alternative punishment.
In its revised decision in December, UEFA gave Milan until June 2021 to comply with the rules or face a one-season ban from European competition.
Milan are currently fourth in Serie A, which is the final Champions League qualifying place for next season's competition.

(Reuters) - Argentina's national soccer coach Lionel Scaloni has been released from hospital in Mallorca after being hit by a car while riding his bicycle, the Argentine football association said on Tuesday.
""The Argentina coach, Lionel Scaloni, suffered an accident today while cycling. He is now on his way home after being discharged from hospital,"" the team's Twitter account said.
Spanish newspaper El Mundo said earlier on Tuesday that Scaloni, who was named Argentina's permanent coach in November, was taken to the Hospital Universitario Son Espases on the Spanish island with multiple injuries.
Scaloni later posted a picture of himself on his official Twitter account sporting tape above and below his bruised left eye and on his nose and forehead, with the words: ""Many thanks for the messages, a few stitches and now I'm off back home.""
Scaloni will oversee the team's Copa America campaign this year, with Argentina bidding to win their first major trophy since 1993.
The 40-year-old made seven appearances for his country as a defender and had a long, varied career which began at Newell's Old Boys, in Rosario in central Argentina.
His longest spell at one club came at Deportivo La Coruna, where he won the La Liga title in 2000, while he also played for Racing Santander and Mallorca in Spain plus West Ham United and Lazio and Atalanta, retiring from playing in 2015.
He became assistant to Jorge Sampaoli at La Liga outfit Sevilla in 2016 and followed him when he became coach of Argentina in 2017.
Sampaoli was sacked in the wake of the side's disastrous 2018 World Cup campaign and their last-16 defeat to France, but Scaloni stayed on as caretaker coach before being handed the job on a permanent basis in November.

(Reuters) - Former Huddersfield Town manager David Wagner said he is ready to return to management and is eyeing the opportunity to take over the reins of a club in the Premier League or German Bundesliga.
Wagner, who guided Huddersfield into the top flight for the first time in 45 years and saved them from relegation last year, stepped down in January after winning just two games all season. Huddersfield were eventually relegated last weekend.
""I have two markets now where I am absolutely ready to compete when the right opportunity comes around the corner,"" the German told The Times in an interview.
""The Premier League is the most challenging league in terms of the quality of the clubs, the quality of the managers, the quality of the individuals.
""The German Bundesliga is very interesting for me because I was born and brought up in Germany. I've never worked in the Bundesliga so that makes it more exciting.""
Wagner said he would only take up a job which challenged him, one where the club was ready to trust him and his ideas rather than stick to a process they were familiar with.
""The set-up has to be right, the owner has to be brave enough to try and bring his club forward,"" Wagner added. ""It's all about if the club likes to go into the challenge the way I like to challenge.
""The mindset has to be exciting and really challenging. If it's a club that only likes to do what they have done before, I don't think this excites (me).
""If they like to progress, if someone says, 'OK, this is the fresh air we would like to bring to our football,' then it's not too important if the aim is to leave three teams behind you, challenge for the top ten or try to attack the top six.""
Wagner previously managed the Borussia Dortmund reserve team before moving to England in 2015.

(Reuters) - Liverpool are confident Virgil van Dijk and Georginio Wijnaldum can shake off minor knocks in time to face Porto in Tuesday's Champions League quarter-final first leg at Anfield, manager Juergen Klopp said on Monday.
The Dutch international duo were among a number of players with problems following Friday's 3-1 Premier League victory at Southampton that left the title-chasing Merseyside club top of the standings with five matches remaining.
""We had little problems after the game... Wijnaldum a little back problem... I think even Virg from a fall on the ground. But they all should be OK, hopefully,"" Klopp told reporters.
Centre back Joe Gomez, who has been sidelined since December after having surgery for a leg fracture, could feature while playmaker Adam Lallana is still recovering from a muscle issue.
""Gomez won't play unless he has to. Lallana has just a little thing that kept him out for the weekend and maybe for tomorrow,"" Klopp added.
Last season's runners-up Liverpool dominated Bayern Munich last month, sealing a 3-1 away win after a goalless draw at Anfield to move into the quarter-finals.
""After the Bayern game everyone spoke about the 0-0 here and everyone said that wasn't enough. It was clear we had a chance in Munich and we used it. Now we have to face Porto with the same respect,"" the German said.
""We're on fire at the moment, you see it in training. We want to write a few proper things in this season's book... it'll be a tough one but that's how it should be.""
Liverpool beat Porto 5-0 on aggregate in last season's round of 16, with all the goals coming in the first leg in Portugal, but Klopp stressed they should not underestimate their rivals.
""We didn't want Porto, to be honest... people with a proper idea about football didn't. That's the truth. But nobody wanted Liverpool,"" he added.
""It'll be tough but we're really looking forward to it.""

The Cincinnati Bengals have waived running back Mark Walton after his third arrest of 2019, the team announced on Saturday.
""It's important for our team to get off to a fresh start as we begin the 2019 season,"" said head coach Zac Taylor in the statement.
""For that reason, we felt it best if we move forward without Mark Walton. We hope his situation gets resolved, but we don't want to take anything away from the good work that so many other players have already begun to demonstrate.""
Walton surrendered to police in Florida on Thursday on a felony charge of carrying a concealed weapon, along with marijuana possession and reckless driving in connection with an incident that occurred March 12 in North Miami-Dade.
That evening, police tried to pull over Walton as he drove erratically. When he did park the car, he got out and ran away. He was shot in the back with a stun gun as he tried to escape but managed to remove the prongs and vanish, according to the Miami Herald, citing court documents.
A search of the car, which had been rented in Walton's name, resulted in police locating a 9 mm carbine rifle, several loaded clips and 14 grams of marijuana, according to police. He had purchased the weapon legally.
On Feb. 16, he was arrested and charged with misdemeanor battery in South Florida.
Police said those charges stemmed from an argument he had with a couple at his condominium complex over his car blocking the entrance to the parking garage, the Miami Herald reported.
A scuffle occurred when Walton, apparently angry the woman was recording their confrontation on her phone, took the phone from her, according to the Herald. Walton and the woman sustained scratches in the incident.
He also was arrested on a misdemeanor marijuana possession charge in January and is awaiting trial.
Walton, 22, played his college football at Miami and was taken by the Bengals in the fourth round of the 2018 NFL Draft. He saw limited action, gaining 34 yards on 14 carries.

The Dallas Cowboys and franchise-tagged defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence agreed to a five-year contract, the team announced Friday.
Multiple media outlets reported the deal is worth $105 million, with $65 million guaranteed and more money in the first year ($31.1 million) than any non-quarterback contract in NFL history, breaking the mark set by Khalil Mack last fall.
According to The MMQB, the deal also sets new benchmarks among defensive players in percentage of total and full guarantees on a long-term contract. Mack, the NFL's highest-paid defender at $23.5 million annually, received $90 million guaranteed for injury and $60 million fully guaranteed at signing.
Earlier Friday, NFL Network reported Lawrence and the Cowboys were making progress after negotiations were at an ""impasse"" last week.
--He may or may not be on the trading block, but Arizona Cardinals quarterback Josh Rosen is planning to report for duty when the team's strength and conditioning program begins on Monday, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter.
According to Schefter's sources, the Cardinals have not actively shopped around Rosen with any teams ahead of the NFL draft that begins April 25, though they have been approached.
Speculation around the league is that the Cardinals will take Oklahoma quarterback Kyler Murray with the first overall pick.
--The Cleveland Browns signed quarterback Garrett Gilbert and safety Morgan Burnett, who was released by the Pittsburgh Steelers on Monday.
Gilbert became available when the Alliance of American Football suspended operations earlier this week. The former sixth-round pick of the Los Angeles Rams had led the AAF with 2,152 passing yards and 13 touchdowns this season, playing for the Orlando Apollos.
Burnett is expected to play safety after serving primarily as a dime linebacker for Pittsburgh last season.
--A day after getting released by the Oakland Raiders, wideout Seth Roberts agreed to sign with the Baltimore Ravens on a one-year deal.
Roberts, 28, was set to make $4.45 million this season with the Raiders. He caught 45 passes for 494 yards and two touchdowns in 15 games last season (seven starts).
The Ravens also worked out former Packers and Seahawks running back Eddie Lacy, who was out of the league in 2018, according to Pro Football Talk.
--The Raiders signed unrestricted free agent safety Jordan Richards.
Richards played in 15 games, making a career-high 12 starts, for the Atlanta Falcons last season. He set a career high with 37 tackles.
Oakland also signed defensive end Alex Barrett, who had two sacks for the San Diego Fleet in the AAF.
--Minnesota Vikings cornerback Holton Hill has been suspended four games for violating the NFL policy on performance-enhancing substances.
Hill, 22, had 36 tackles and one interception in 16 games (three starts) last season as an undrafted rookie. He reportedly failed a drug test at the 2018 NFL Combine and at least one drug test as a college player at Texas.
The Vikings also signed two defensive backs from the AAF, safety Derron Smith and cornerback Duke Thomas of the San Antonio Commanders.
--The San Francisco 49ers signed former AAF defensive end Damontre Moore to a one-year deal.
Moore had seven sacks while starring for the San Diego Fleet, a half-sack back of the league lead.
Moore, 26, has 10 career sacks in 54 games over parts of six NFL seasons.
--Former Arizona Hotshots running back Jhurell Pressley is facing a two-game suspension by the NFL for ""a pending issue,"" according to an NFL Network report.
The report added Pressley is scheduled for workouts next week with two unnamed teams.
Pressley led the AAF in rushing, with 96 carries for 431 yards and one touchdown.
--The Chicago Bears will work out former AAF kickers Younghoe Koo and Nick Rose on Wednesday, according to the Chicago Tribune.
Per the report, a third kicker could join the workout.
Koo and Rose each went 14 of 14 on field-goal attempts with the AAF, although all of Koo's attempts were from 38 yards or closer. Rose hit one from 54 yards and another from 50.
--The Pittsburgh Steelers signed former AAF teammates J.C. Hassanauer and Jack Tocho.
Hassanauer played center for the Birmingham Iron, while Tocho was a defensive back on the same squad, notching six pass breakups and an interception.
--The Carolina Panthers signed former AAF offensive linemen Parker Collins and Kitt O'Brien.
Collins played center for the Atlanta Legends, while O'Brien was a guard for the Iron.
--The Indianapolis Colts re-signed offensive tackle J'Marcus Webb.
The 31-year-old missed most of last season after sustaining a hamstring injury in the season opener.
--The New York Jets claimed wideout/return specialist Quadree Henderson off waivers from the Giants.
Henderson, 22, returned nine punts for 68 yards (7.6-yard average) and five kickoffs for 112 yards (22.4 average) in five games last season. He did not catch a pass.

LOS ANGELES — Reality star Kim Kardashian is studying to be a lawyer, inspired by her success in helping to win the release from U.S. prisons of two women.
Kardashian told Vogue magazine in an interview published on Wednesday that she has begun a four-year apprenticeship with a San Francisco-based law firm under a California program for those without formal qualifications. Kardashian, who dropped out of college, said she aims to take the bar exam in 2022.
The ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians"" star said she made the decision last summer after visiting the White House and persuading President Donald Trump to commute a life sentence handed out to a 63-year-old woman in Tennessee for a first drug offense.
""I just felt like I wanted to be able to fight for people who have paid their dues to society. I just felt like the system could be so different, and I wanted to fight to fix it, and if I knew more, I could do more,” Kardashian, 38, told Vogue.
Kardashian helped to win clemency in January for another woman in Tennessee who had been convicted as a teenager of murdering a man who paid to have sex with her.
Kardashian said her first year of the apprenticeship involved studying three subjects: criminal law, torts and contracts.
""To me, torts is the most confusing, contracts the most boring, and crime law I can do in my sleep. Took my first test, I got a 100. Super easy for me,"" she told Vogue. ""The reading is what really gets me. It’s so time-consuming. The concepts I grasp in two seconds.”
While best known for developing beauty and fashion products and showcasing her life with her sisters on the TV show ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians,"" Kardashian has some powerful legal DNA.
Her late father, Robert Kardashian, was a prominent Los Angeles lawyer who was part of the legal team representing football star O.J. Simpson in his 1995 trial and acquittal for double murder.

LOS ANGELES — A Los Angeles man pleaded not guilty on Thursday to charges that he killed Grammy-nominated rapper Nipsey Hussle and was ordered held on $5 million bail.
Eric Ronald Holder, 29, entered his pleas to murder and attempted murder charges through his attorney during a brief hearing in Los Angeles Superior Court.
Holder appeared in court behind bars in a holding cell and spoke only to acknowledge his rights. He was ordered held on $5 million bail and told to return for a hearing on May 10.
Holder was represented in the high-profile case by Chris Darden who, as a Los Angeles County deputy district attorney in the 1990s, unsuccessfully prosecuted former football star O.J. Simpson for murder.
Darden asked Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Teresa Sullivan to ban cameras from the courtroom, a request she denied. Darden declined to speak to reporters as he left the courthouse.
Hussle, whose real name was Ermias Asghedom, was shot multiple times on March 31 outside his Marathon Clothing store in south Los Angeles. Two other people were wounded by gunfire.
PERSONAL DISPUTE
Holder was taken into custody on Tuesday in the Los Angeles suburb of Bellflower after a caller reported seeing the man police had named as a suspect. Investigators say the slaying was motivated by a personal dispute between the two men.
Holder faces a maximum sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole if convicted at trial. A woman who drove Holder away from the scene has not been arrested or charged in the case.
The Los Angeles Times reported on Thursday that Holder was an aspiring rapper and suspected gang member who went by the nickname ""Fly Mac"". He has a previous conviction for carrying a loaded firearm, the paper said.
A disturbance erupted at a vigil for Hussle on Monday, setting off a stampede that critically injured two people.
Hussle's debut studio album, ""Victory Lap,"" was nominated for Best Rap Album at this year's Grammy Awards and his death prompted tributes on social media.
The rapper, who was of Eritrean descent and grew up in south Los Angeles, has said that he once belonged to a street gang but more recently he had parlayed his fame into a role as a community organizer and activist.
Hussle wrote ""having strong enemies is a blessing"" in a Twitter post on the day of his death.

MINNEAPOLIS — Sometime during the Final Four on Saturday, the television cameras will focus on Auburn Coach Bruce Pearl. They are likely to find him in his usual animated state: limping up and down the sideline, screaming, arms flailing, his face the color of a bowl of borscht, his once-pressed suit reduced to a rumpled outfit paying homage to the land of a thousand (perspiration) lakes.
“He might as well be out there on the floor with us with a jersey on, honestly, the way he’ll be sweating,” Auburn forward Malik Dunbar said with a laugh. “He wants to win so badly.”
Pearl’s problem, at least at several previous stops in a nearly four-decade coaching career, is that he wants to win so badly he
does not always play by the rules
. Yes, he has led Auburn (30-9) to its first Final Four, and to a date with Virginia (33-3) in Saturday’s first national semifinal. But before that, Pearl committed a recruiting violation at Wisconsin-Milwaukee, was fired for a similar one at Tennessee, got blackballed by the N.C.A.A. and then saw two assistants leave his staff at Auburn under the cloud of F.B.I. investigations.
But lost in his scofflaw history and his sideline histrionics is this: Bruce Pearl can coach.
Pearl, 59, relishes his role as an outsider. He was a student manager at Boston College, he is the third Jew to take a team to the Final Four and he spent a decade in Division II when nobody would hire him for trying to get a rival program in trouble with the N.C.A.A. Yet he has arrived in Minneapolis at the top of his game, on his terms.
That is, as an underdog.
At Auburn, basketball has largely been an afterthought — a diversion between football and spring football — but the Tigers, seeded fifth in the Midwest Region, arrived at their first Final Four by taking down three of the game’s blue bloods: Kansas, North Carolina and Kentucky. Next up is Virginia, the only remaining No. 1 seed.
“He has a great way of motivating people,” Auburn center Austin Wiley said of Pearl. “If he has ammo to use, he’s definitely going to use it, and we’re going to run through a brick wall.”
Pearl has changed little since he left the knee of Tom Davis, whom he had followed from Boston College to Stanford to Iowa as an assistant. He still espouses Davis’s tenets — pressure defense and playing fast — and a commitment to firing away from the 3-point line.
Pearl rode that organized chaos to the Division II championship at Southern Indiana in 1995, and it lends itself to playing in the N.C.A.A. tournament as an underdog, which is where Pearl’s teams have often excelled. He is 7-6 in the tournament as a lower-seeded team, having taken 12th-seeded Wisconsin-Milwaukee to the round of 16 in 2005, sixth-seeded Tennessee to a regional final in 2010 and, now, fifth-seeded Auburn to the Final Four.
It is hardly a surprise for some of his former players to see Auburn’s guards, Jared Harper and Bryce Brown, who were largely written off as too small or too frail by other programs, play like five-star talents for Pearl.
“Right away, when you put that uniform, he instills that confidence in you,” said Marc Hostetter, the point guard on Pearl’s championship team at Southern Indiana and now a middle school principal in Mount Vernon, Ind. “We all thought we were Division I players and it was somebody else’s fault that we weren’t there. I can’t overstate the fact that everybody plays as hard as they’ve ever played for him.”
That championship came after his Screaming Eagles fell behind the University of California, Riverside by 22 points early in the final and by 18 at halftime before storming back.
Stan Gouard, the star of that team, said Pearl did not yell at him. He would just tell Gouard that he was being outplayed. Or he would just make a face — one of many now familiar to Auburn players.
“They’re funny gestures,” said Gouard, now coaching at the University of Indianapolis. “Those faces are, ‘You’re not doing your job, you need to do better.’ Sometimes, the face says a lot of words.”
When Pearl finally returned to Division I at Wisconsin-Milwaukee, he once watched his team going through the motions in a game at lowly Cleveland State, lulled to sleep by a comfortable lead and a crowd of about 1,000 fans. Pearl called timeout.
“He sat us down, told a dry-sense-of-humor dad joke and after the punch line, just stood up and walked to the water cooler at the end of the bench,” said Adrian Tigart, who played on Pearl’s round of 16 team at Wisconsin-Milwaukee. “We all just looked at each other kind of confused, then laughed. He is so in tune with his guys and knows what levers to pull and when.”
When Tigert saw Pearl — who used to wear an orange blazer at Tennessee when the Vols played in-state rivals and who once
turned up shirtless and painted orange
for a Lady Vols basketball game — celebrating with Auburn fans on his way off the court after the win against Kentucky, he knew it was not for show.
“The double hand wave, like a politician?” Tigert said. “He used to do that on a Tuesday night when we’d go down to U.I.C. and there would be 30 people who had brought a fan bus down to Chicago.”
If some of it seems engineered, Pearl will not argue.
He is always looking, always evaluating, always gauging for how to make a connection. And he will rely on it again on Saturday, when he has told his players to act as if they have been here before, even thought they have not.
“I never felt like I had all the answers, but I want to give my guys confidence,” Pearl said. “I tell my players, ‘Like sometimes you have to overcome a bad call or a teammate taking a bad shot, you’ve got to overcome me.’ But I can say, look over a period of time and I’ve won a national championship and I’ve won. So they need to draw a certain level of confidence from me that we’ve been there and that what we do works.”
So when Pearl is a disheveled mess on Saturday, hobbling, screaming, making faces and drenched in a puddle of sweat, he is merely staying in character — and hoping his team does the same.

SYDNEY — Dumping the Western Force from Super Rugby enabled Rugby Australia (RA) to post a surplus of A$5.2 million (£2.8 million) in 2018, but it could have long-term benefits, the governing body said on Monday.
RA chose to cut the Perth-based side ahead of the 2018 season following an agreement with the competition's governing body SANZAAR to reduce the number of teams as it faced a backlash from fans and broadcasters after an ill-fated decision to expand to 18 teams in 2016.
The cut saved RA about A$6.48m last year, having spent almost A$12.17m across five Super Rugby sides in 2017. In total the organisation was able to make almost A$15m in cost savings.
""One of the reasons why we went back to four (Super Rugby teams) was to improve the financial health of the organisation,"" RA chairman Cameron Clyne told reporters after the annual general meeting in Sydney.
""But we also needed to make the (Super Rugby) teams more competitive and in 2018 and 2019 the teams have been, so you are starting to see uplifts in broadcast (numbers) and if that continues then you see better revenue flows.""
One of the major concerns facing SANZAAR was the number of uncompetitive matches that had developed in Super Rugby, which adversely affected television viewing numbers and fan engagement, he added.
Australia's playing stocks were also spread too thin across five teams, often relying on journeyman players from South Africa and New Zealand to fill out their squads.
Their sides also endured a 40-match losing streak, which lasted longer than two years, to teams from their trans-Tasman neighbours, before it was broken last May.
""We are now beating New Zealand teams in 2018 and 2019,"" Clyne said. ""So that is a sign the teams are playing better and more attractive football.""
Despite 2018 being one of their ""better financial years"" Clyne said lost revenue due to the Rugby World Cup in Japan later this year would see it operate at a loss in 2019.
RA expects it will face reduced domestic broadcast and matchday revenue of almost A$33 million because of the tournament, although World Rugby will offset some of those losses with a grant of A$19.4 million.
""We always make a loss in World Cup years because we play less test matches. There are only three test matches in Australia,"" he said.
""(But) there is no question that a World Cup year, particularly if your team does well, allows you to leverage off that.
""Hopefully we can come back with the Cup and then build off that in 2020.""

(Reuters) - Burnley made a big step towards securing Premier League survival after coming back from a goal down to beat Bournemouth 3-1 away as their striker Ashley Barnes scored at both ends in an action-packed contest on Saturday.
The result lifted Burnley into 14th place on 36 points from 33 games, eight above the relegation zone with 18th-placed Cardiff on 28 points from 32 matches. Bournemouth are 13th on 38 points from 33 games.
Burnley manager Sean Dyche praised his side who overcame a jittery start at the Vitality stadium.
""So many parts of the performance were strong today,"" Dyche told the BBC. ""There was no nervousness and we stayed clear-minded. There was a real calmness to our play.
""Twenty-four points since Christmas is a very strong return. We kept playing, we kept probing, we kept doing all the diligent things that we do well.
""It puts us in a much healthier situation than we were two games ago.""
The home side took a fourth-minute lead after Barnes headed into his own net but Burnley came roaring back as Chris Wood levelled with an 18th-minute header before Ashley Westwood swept in a shot from 13 metres barely two minutes later.
Both goals resulted from sloppy Bournemouth defending as their keeper Asmir Begovic misjudged an inswinging corner for the equaliser before Chris Mepham's poor clearance gave Westwood time and space to fire the visitors ahead.
Callum Wilson missed a gilt-edged chance to equalise midway through the first half when he headed over the bar from close range before another Begovic howler allowed Barnes to score at the right end in the 57th minute.
Wood beat the indecisive Begovic to a deflected cross at the near post, as he turned swiftly and squared the ball back to his strike partner Barnes who rifled it confidently into an empty net from eight metres.
Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe was unhappy with his team's bloodless performance which stretched their winless home run to four games, leaving them with only one win from their last nine league outings.
""There were lots of elements from our performance today which wasn't great,"" said Howe.
""I have always backed our goalkeepers. Mistakes happen in football. Today we made numerous mistakes in areas we wouldn't expect them to happen.
""We pride ourselves on our professionalism and our ability to never give up but it didn't look like that today. We are on a difficult run and confidence is maybe a bit low but the season isn't over yet.""

TURIN, Italy — Teenage striker Moise Kean struck again to give Juventus a late 2-1 win over AC Milan after their opponents had taken the lead and dominated most of the match on Saturday.
The 19-year-old, who suffered alleged racist abuse after scoring at Cagliari on Tuesday, came off the bench to score his fifth goal in his last five league appearances to move Juve ever closer to an eighth successive Serie A title.
Juve, still missing Cristiano Ronaldo because of a thigh injury, are 21 points clear at the top and they will wrap up the title with seven games to spare if second-placed Napoli lose at home to Genoa on Sunday.
Fourth-placed Milan have taken one point out of their last 12 and will be knocked out of the top four if Atalanta, who are one point behind them, win at Inter Milan on Sunday.
Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri praised his team's second half display while his counterpart Gennaro Gattuso was left to lament Milan's ""naivety.""
""The first half was not so good but we recovered well in the second when we were more organised and moved the ball around more cleanly,"" said Allegri.
Gattuso said: ""We played well on a technical-tactical level and we were courageous... we were naive because we made two mistakes against a great team.
""I don't care less what people say about me,"" he added. ""Maybe I won so much with this club as a player that people expect different things from me. Now I see football from a different perspective.""
Krzysztof Piatek headed wide in an unmarked position at the far post from a Suso cross after 90 seconds in an early warning as Milan took control.
Juve survived another fright when a Hakan Calhanoglu cross struck Alex Sandro's elbow at close range in the area, but after VAR review which lasted over three minutes, the referee decided it was unintentional.
Minutes later, however, Leonardo Bonucci's pass out of defence was intercepted by Tiemoue Bakayoko and he fed the ball to Piatek who slotted past Wojciech Szczesny for his 21st league goal of the season -- eight for Milan and 13 for Genoa.
Juventus were making little headway until they won a penalty following a clumsy challenge by Mateo Musacchio on Paulo Dybala, who converted the spot kick himself on the hour.
The winner was similar to Milan's goal as Miralem Pjanic, another substitute, intercepted a pass out of defence and found Kean who calmly placed his shot beyond Pepe Reina with six minutes left.

(Reuters) - When Liverpool cleared a corner and the ball arrived at Mohamed Salah's feet 20 yards inside his own half at Southampton on Friday there was just one thing on the Egyptian's mind.
A handful of seconds later, after a searing 50-metre run, his left-foot shot flew past Angus Gunn to give Liverpool the lead on a nailbiting night on the south coast.
Jordan Henderson scored another one to make it 3-1 and confirm Liverpool's place back on top of the Premier League, but the defining moment was Salah's drought-busting effort.
He had not scored for eight matches, his worst run at Liverpool, but his 80th-minute intervention could not have been better-timed. It was his 50th Premier League goal for Liverpool and, more importantly, proved that any concern over his form in the title run-in could be put to bed.
With five league games left Salah is undeniably back.
""What a goal! Wow, what a goal!"" Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp, who hugged his striker on the pitch as Liverpool's fans roared out their song about the ""Egyptian King"".
Salah is the eighth Liverpool player to score 50 Premier League goals, but his half century arrived in only 69 games, three fewer than Fernando Torres, the previous quickest to the mark.
Only two other players in the Premier League era have reached the landmark quicker -- Manchester United's Ruud van Nistelrooy and Alan Shearer for Blackburn Rovers.
Klopp told reporters he had never doubted Salah would rediscover his scoring touch.
""It was never in doubt about him being a great player from my side,"" Klopp said. ""It was goal number 50 I heard for Liverpool, that's an incredible number,"" the German said.
""As a striker, you have chances and each striker is a human being -- maybe you have better moments and less good moments. But he is pretty consistent, his physical things are always there. He always stayed calm to deal with the situation.""
Liverpool were not at their best, especially in a sluggish first half when they gave the ball away cheaply too often and Southampton threatened to add to their ninth-minute opener scored by Shane Long.
But once Naby Keita levelled with a deflected header in the 36th minute, his first goal for Liverpool, the visitors were relentless in their pursuit of a crucial win.
Klopp's side have now won seven of their last eight Premier League games when conceding the opening goal -- a resilience that will be causing concern at relentless Manchester City who now trail by two points having played a game less.
""The season is intense for everyone,"" Klopp said. ""The performance was not top level but it is about fighting.
""People want us to play like Manchester City, we are unable to do that, we play our own football. We have 82 points now, that is massive in this crazy league and everyone is waiting for us. I am really proud. It is incredible.
""It is a difficult year for everybody, you need to have 70-75 points for the (top-four) Champions League and 90-something for the title.
""We are in the race and that is nice.""

COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa — Iowa and Nebraska transportation officials said Thursday that they're hoping to have nearly all roads and bridges that were damaged by last month's flooding repaired by midsummer, but that a wet spring could hamper their efforts.
Iowa Department of Transportation Director Mark Lowe and his Nebraska counterpart, Kyle Schneweis, held a joint news conference in Council Bluffs to update the public on the damage in their states and how long it might take to repair.
In Iowa, the damage is concentrated in the west along Interstate 29 and the Missouri River.
""The work to get traffic moving again has been nonstop,"" Lowe said. ""We have people who don't know what day it is anymore because they've been working day and night.""
Lowe said many repairs have been made and some roads have been opened along the interstate north of Council Bluffs, which is just across the river from Omaha, Nebraska. The damage is heavier farther south, where twin bridges along the interstate south of Nebraska City and north of Hamburg, Iowa, were heavily damaged. The state hopes to have traffic moving in that area again by June.
""The complicating factor is that the flooding threat is not over,"" he said. ""Because of damage to the levee system, we will have to balance how future flooding might affect repair efforts.""
There were 50 levee breaks along the Missouri River during March flooding, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said Thursday. Several of them span more than a football field in length, and at least one near the Missouri state line on the Iowa side stretches 1,140 feet. Crews are working to repair those levees, but the Corps has been unable to begin repairs on some areas — mostly in southwestern Iowa — that are still underwater.
Weather experts say this spring could bring major flooding for much of the U.S, as the ground in the Midwest and South is already saturated and northern snowmelt is expected to be significant. The extent of the flooding will largely depend on how much rain falls over the next few months. Thursday's news conference was held as the second ""bomb cyclone "" in as many months dropped heavy snow from Colorado to Nebraska, South Dakota and Minnesota.
Nebraska suffered heavy flooding last month along the Missouri, Niobrara, Elkhorn and Platte rivers. Although the damage covered a larger area, it didn't disrupt traffic on roads as busy as I-29.
Still, an impassable county road or washed out bridge can add one to two hours of commuting time for some rural residents trying to get kids to school or a tractor to the far side of a farm, Schneweis said. Just west of Omaha, a washed out section of Highway 6 is affecting about 20,000 commuters, he said.
""It's a little like saying you love all your kids the same,"" Schneweis said. ""It's important to us that all of these people can get where they need to go.""
It's not just flooding that's affecting Nebraska roadways, he added. Because much of I-29 in Iowa is closed, traffic has dramatically increased on Nebraska's Highway 75, which runs about parallel to the interstate.
""That highway is not equipped to handle that amount of traffic, and it's taking a toll,"" Schneweis said.
In all, Iowa had nearly 50 miles along the I-29 corridor that are damaged, nearly half of that categorized as severe. Lowe said damage estimates are between $70 million to $90 million. In Nebraska, 180 miles of roadway and 27 bridges were damaged by the flooding, including 12 that are still closed. Schneweis estimated that there was $160 million in road and bridge damage.
Officials were hoping the latest big storm wouldn't exacerbate flooding along already swollen rivers.
""I know it's something we're all holding our breath on,"" Schnewies said.

The international chemical weapons watchdog said it was sending a fact-finding mission to a Syrian town where a suspected chemical gas attack had taken place over the weekend.

LONDON — “Coronation Street,”
Britain’s (and the world’s) longest-running soap opera,
which has chronicled working-class life near Manchester, England, since 1960, is introducing the first black family in the history of the series.
“Say hello to the Bailey family,” the show’s producers said
in an announcement on Saturday
. “A brand-new family moving to Weatherfield in June this year!” they added, referring to the fictional town based on Salford, an industrial city about two miles west of the center of Manchester.
The announcement did not address the family’s race or ethnicity, but the show’s network, ITV, said the black family would be the show’s first.
To many observers, the addition, while welcome, came astonishingly late for a show, known as “Corrie,” that debuted in December 1960 and that has been watched by up to
a third of the British public
— including, reports say, Queen Elizabeth II.
“How have the producers managed to get away with this for almost 60 years?” Matthew Xia, a theater director,
told The Guardian,
saying he was stunned it had taken so long for the show to reflect Manchester’s multicultural character.
“It’s about time, a street right in the heart of Manchester and they’ve never had a black family live there,” one Twitter user, Carly Purland-Goodey,
wrote
on Saturday.
For decades, the set where the show was filmed was in central Manchester. In the 1970s and ’80s, the show
was broadcast in the United States
, first on public television to a lukewarm reception, and then on cable.
The show’s producer, Ian MacLeod, told ITV News that he did not know why the soap took so long to introduce a black family.
“Manchester has a large proportion of black residents, so it did feel sort of overdue we did this and represented modern Manchester a bit more accurately,”
Mr. MacLeod said
.
“Coronation Street” has had individual characters who are black or members of other racial and ethnic groups before. In 2013, a character of Pakistani origin appeared, followed shortly by members of his family, the Nazirs. (In 2016, Marc Anwar, who portrayed the father, Sharif Nazir,
was fired over anti-India posts on Twitter
.)
The series, based on the residents of fictional Coronation Street,
has been a British favorite
for years alongside “EastEnders,” set in East London, and “Emmerdale,” set in Yorkshire. The story lines revolve around lives that viewers can easily identify with and have produced quotations and characters that are firmly engraved in British culture.
The shows have given rise to some of the most popular television celebrities in the country,
including Pat Phoenix
, who played the glamorous Elsie Tanner on “Coronation Street,” and Barbara Windsor, who appeared as Peggy Mitchell, the protective pub owner in “EastEnders.”
Both shows are so iconic that they appear in guides to British culture that applicants for citizenship have to study to take the test.
“Coronation” was anointed the world’s longest-running TV soap when “As the World Turns” aired its last episode in 2010 on CBS,
according to the Guinness World Records.
In recent years, soap operas have seen a decline in viewership, according to a report published in 2018 by the Office of Communications, or Ofcom, Britain’s telecom regulator. In 2007, “EastEnders,” “Coronation Street” and “Emmerdale” averaged 8.7 million viewers among them. By 2017, that figure had dropped to 6.9 million,
the report said.
In contrast with the aspirational settings and improbable plots of American soaps, the British shows have lured viewers by portraying daily life with all its difficulties,
such as joblessness, poverty and raising children as single parents
. Still, their plot lines have been criticized for being nostalgic for a bygone era and tone-deaf to the changes in modern Britain.
The addition of the new family to “Coronation Street” appeared to be an attempt to address those issues, especially with the character of James Bailey, the 19-year-old younger son played by Nathan Graham. A talented footballer, the character will face the challenges of coming out as gay to his family and teammates.
The rest of the family includes the father, Edison, a builder, played by Trevor Michael Georges; the mother, Aggie, a pharmacy assistant, played by Lorna Laidlaw; and the older son, Michael, played by Ryan Russell.
The new family will make its debut on the show in June.

WASHINGTON — The Treasury Department allowed the influential Russian oligarch Oleg V. Deripaska to satisfy the terms of his divorce by transferring tens of millions of dollars in stock to benefit his children as part of a deal to lift United States sanctions on his corporate empire, according to the Trump administration and an interview with Mr. Deripaska.
The deal, announced by the Trump administration in December without publicly disclosing its details, included a clause providing for the completion of a transfer of 10.5 million shares of Mr. Deripaska’s main holding company, EN+, to a trust fund for the two teenage children he had with his former wife, Polina Yumasheva.
The couple divorced last year, and their settlement, which called for him to provide funds for their children, was finalized before Mr. Deripaska and his companies were sanctioned in April 2018, according to representatives of the Treasury Department, Mr. Deripaska and EN+.
The transfer has drawn the ire of Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, who is a member of the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Treasury Department. He said in a
letter sent late last month
to Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, that the transfer of the EN+ shares — which had a value of more than $78 million at the close of business on Monday — “constitutes a clear benefit to Deripaska and his children,” and conflicts with Treasury Department claims that neither would benefit from the sanctions relief deal.
The sanctions were intended to punish seven oligarchs and their companies — including Mr. Deripaska, EN+ and the giant aluminum company it controls, Rusal — for their affiliations with a Russian government that “engages in a range of malign activity around the globe,” including election interference, Mr. Mnuchin
said at the time
.
When the Treasury Department
announced the deal
with Mr. Deripaska’s companies to lift the sanctions, it cast the move as an effort to stabilize global aluminum markets roiled by the sanctions, and said that Mr. Deripaska would not personally benefit. As part of the deal, he agreed to relinquish control of the companies and sell off a significant portion of his ownership, with proceeds going into blocked accounts that he would not be able to access.
But members of Congress on both sides of the aisle blasted the deal as soft on Russia, and
unsuccessfully tried to block it
from going into effect. Those concerns were inflamed further when
it was revealed
that the confidential, legally binding document detailing the agreement showed that Mr. Deripaska and his allies would retain majority ownership of EN+.
The agreement specified that 1.64 percent of the shares of EN+ would be transferred to an entity called the Liberi Foundation, for which there was no easily traceable public record. After receiving inquiries from journalists, EN+ officials said Liberi was a trust fund for Mr. Deripaska’s children.
But when asked by Mr. Wyden at a Senate Finance Committee hearing late last month about the arrangement, Mr. Mnuchin said of Mr. Deripaska that “his children did in no way benefit from sanctions relief.”
A Treasury Department spokeswoman sought to clarify Mr. Mnuchin’s statement last week, saying that “Deripaska’s children were legally entitled to shares stemming from a divorce settlement that predated the sanctions.”
Larissa Belyaeva, a spokeswoman for Mr. Deripaska, said in a statement that he “disclaimed all rights to claw back those shares.”
She added, “Nor did his children benefit as all that was honored was a pre-existing legal entitlement to settle shares as part of a divorce settlement.”
She said the votes from the shares would be cast by independent trustees appointed by the Treasury Department.
Independent trustees also will control the votes associated with shares owned by other people or entities with connections to Mr. Deripaska. They include his charitable foundation, his former wife, her father and a family-linked firm called Orandy Capital Limited, as well as shares being transferred to VTB, a Russian government-owned bank under limited United States sanctions that had lent Mr. Deripaska large sums of money.
And in a
rare interview late last month
, Mr. Deripaska said of the transfer to Liberi, “It’s a small portion of the shares. And it was part of my settlement with my wife, which was set long before.”
Last month, Mr. Deripaska
sued the Treasury Department
and its officials, including Mr. Mnuchin, to reverse the sanctions that remain in place on him personally, claiming that he was deprived due process and that the sanctions cost him billions of dollars and made him “radioactive” in international business circles.
In the interview with The New York Times, he blasted the sanctions as targeting him solely because he was a prominent Russian who has “a popular brand in the U.S.”
He accused the Treasury Department of misrepresenting him in its justification for the sanctions. In announcing the sanctions, the department had noted that “Deripaska has said that he does not separate himself from the Russian state.”
Mr. Deripaska explained the statement to mean that “it was just who I am.”
“I am Russian,” he said. “And unfortunately, I was sanctioned because I am Russian.”
He added, “I’m not planning to leave Russia to buy a hockey club, a football club, to spend crazy money on luxury things outside my country. I spend most of my time here. My kids are here. And my future also will be in Russia.”

DAILY CROSSWORD COLUMN
Peter A. Collins gets stranded on a desert island, but he’s resourceful.
By
Caitlin Lovinger
SUNDAY PUZZLE —
Peter A. Collins is a steady contributor, but we haven’t had a Sunday puzzle from him in about four years. That’s enough time to make one worry a little bit, but here he is. Obviously everything is totally fine, right?
Whatever personal balancing force that gives me a modicum of dignity seems to be imploding right now, so I’ve been tripping over everything lately. That said, this was a generally difficult grid over all, wouldn’t you say? The top third, roughly, gave me fits, I had some major, early errors further down, and I made a slew of small mistakes that nibbled away the time: “bye” for AYE, “tut” for TSK, “arc” for ADS and so on.
There were some names from various pop culture realms, but they were big enough that arcane knowledge wasn’t needed, I don’t think — MALONE, MINEO, MILEY, MRAZ, er, ETHAN.
1A: Who knows what I was looking for here — what can you put in a sack these days, anyway? Day-old bread? — but it wasn’t PASS RUSH. I gather this is some football strategy that can result in a quarterback being tackled, which is a “sack.” Hut hut!
9A: Another doozy, unless you are in the habit of doing your scales on the piano, where “E” and “D” are separated by their close neighbor, D SHARP.
32A: Mr. Collins got me every time with these verb/noun switches. I tried to find some kind of “Rock” instead of some other term for rocking someone, as you do when someone is PUT TO SLEEP gently.
76A: This one was a laugher — say “pink lipstick” aloud and note the three SHORT I’s.
119A: This one was from comedy, but as someone fairly ignorant of “Stooge” humor I was a bit waylaid by the first two characters in IMBECILE.
15D: Never seen a ZESTA cracker before, but this isn’t a debut. They look just like saltines.
45D: Is it my fault that “Mississippi,” a siren of a crossword entry if ever there was one, has the same number of letters as KANSAS STATE? I associate Kansas with
the
Jayhawks
, but that’s the wrong school entirely, the University of Kansas. Ole Miss has a new mascot now, a
landshark
, and were never Wildcats. So I will file away the Kansas State Wildcats for the next time. Talk about a busted bracket — I tried really hard to get all those S’s and P’s to work.
99D: This one made me howl, and I watch “Wheel of Fortune” all the time. When you ask for a “sextet” in a letters game, I’m going to give you vowels in one form or another — first as “vowels,” then as “aeiouy.” I needed every cross and
visual evidence
to get this string — RSTLNE — from the game’s final round, every night. This isn’t even a debut in the Times puzzle. Very tricky!
Assuming that you did not miss its emergency message, in letters nine squares deep, Peter A. Collins is issuing an S.O.S. in today’s grid. Don’t be alarmed, I think; the message is just an indication of some wordplay afoot in six otherwise-unmarked, straightforward entries, four phrases and two song titles. There is also a tiny revealer at 109-Across, but you already knew what it was before you filled it in, I’d wager.
This is one of those where the theme unfurls as you solve; depending on how unevenly you work through, you might find that you suss out the pattern pretty early, but I got most of them at the very end and figuring out the theme didn’t really help me. I’ll just run through these entries with you, at 24- and 118-Across and 3-, 7-, 41- and 56-Down.
There were a couple of theme entries that I got fairly quickly. 24A, “Tired tale,” solved pretty naturally to SAME OLD STORY; the solution to 41D, “Slippery vendor,” struck me as clever and broad: SNAKE OIL SALESMAN. Even so, there were ample crosses on both entries before I got them; same for 3D, which was sadly apropos:
“Not exactly hit the ground running”
START OUT SLOWLY

I did O.K. with 56D, although I never would have thought the song was from
that
long ago:
“1978 Dire Straits hit”
SULTANS OF SWING

And I completely flailed at 7D, for some reason:
“Showed ’em what we’ve got”
STRUTTED OUR STUFF

The last song title was new enough to me that I got it wrong until I looked up “Skilled judoist” (I had “dar” for that instead of DAN). Then I thought I would see if I knew this one from somewhere and I don’t think I do — I was never a follower of the Beach Boys, really, although I generally enjoy the music. I really liked this version of the song; hopefully it’s not heretical or thunder-stealing for the Boys.
It was a key to this puzzle’s construction (in my opinion, anyway) that all the middle “O” words in the S-O-S phrases were different. I used OLD, ON, OUT, OUR, OIL and OF. I don’t know that I had a lot of other substantive possibilities.
The most trouble in filling the grid arose in the EASTER WEEK area. It took a few tries to get to this version, and in spite of IES and RSTLNE, Will, Joel, and I thought it was the best of the bunch.

A day after ESPN aired an interview with former Green Bay Packers coach Mike McCarthy discussing how he was dismissed by the team last December, an explosive report looked at the complicated and disastrous relationship between McCarthy and quarterback Aaron Rodgers and how it impacted the team.
The lengthy Bleacher Report story, published Thursday, concluded that the coach-quarterback duo had a frosty relationship since McCarthy's tenure began in 2006. That was the year after McCarthy, previously offensive coordinator for the San Francisco 49ers, favored Utah's Alex Smith over Cal's Rodgers with the No. 1 overall pick of the 2005 NFL Draft.
""Aaron's always had a chip on his shoulder with Mike,"" said Ryan Grant, a Packers running back from 2007-12. ""The guy who ended up becoming your coach passed on you when he had a chance. Aaron was upset that Mike passed on him -- that Mike actually verbally said that Alex Smith was a better quarterback.""
Several players and coaches were quizzed over the complicated relationship in trying to explain why the Packers never turned into a New England Patriots-like dynasty. Allegations included McCarthy missing team meetings to have massages in his office, ex-general manager Ted Thompson falling asleep in meetings and Rodgers routinely changing play calls.
--Cornerback Keith Reaser became the first player from the Alliance of American Football to move to an NFL team, signing with the Kansas City Chiefs, according to multiple reports.
The AAF announced earlier Thursday that league players now could sign with NFL teams. The AAF played eight of its 10 scheduled weeks of the regular season.
Reaser, who played for the Orlando Apollos, was a fifth-round pick of the San Francisco 49ers in 2014. In three-plus seasons with the 49ers, he played in 29 games, recording 34 tackles. He also played one game for the Chiefs in 2017, making four tackles and one sack, but was placed on the waived-injured list in 2018.
--De'Vante Bausby, who tied for the AAF lead with four interceptions, signed with the Denver Broncos, according to multiple media reports. He played for the San Antonio Commanders in the AAF.
Bausby, 26, appeared in four games with the Chicago Bears in 2016 and six games (one start) with the Philadelphia Eagles last year. He has 26 career NFL tackles.
--The Carolina Panthers also reportedly signed an AAF player, adding former Arizona State wide receiver Rashad Ross, who had been playing for the Arizona Hotshots.
ESPN's Adam Schefter reported that the 29-year-old Ross, who caught 36 passes for 583 yards (16.2 yards per catch) and a league-best seven touchdowns, will be a candidate to win the team's final receiver roster spot.
Ross spent parts of three NFL seasons with the Chicago Bears and Washington Redskins, last playing a game in 2016 with Washington. He has never caught an NFL pass but has returned 34 kickoffs in his career, including one for a touchdown in 2015.
--The Arizona Cardinals hosted top defensive line draft candidates Nick Bosa and Quinnen Williams, NFL Network reported.
Bosa met with Cardinals brass last week in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and his visit to the team facility Thursday had been reported earlier this week. Each team may bring 30 players to its facilities for a visit, which cannot include a workout.
Bosa, a defensive end, is considered the top defensive player -- if not No. 1 overall -- in the draft and Williams the top interior defensive lineman. The Cardinals are being almost universally predicted to take former Oklahoma quarterback Kyler Murray with the first pick of the draft later this month.
--The Oakland Raiders released wide receiver Seth Roberts, the team announced.
The move comes a day after the Raiders signed wide receiver Ryan Grant. The Raiders have also added Antonio Brown, Tyrell Williams and J.J. Nelson to their receiving corps.
Roberts, 28, was set to make $4.45 million this season. He caught 45 passes for 494 yards and two touchdowns last season for Oakland. Roberts has 158 receptions and 13 touchdowns for his career, all with the Raiders.
--Free agent linebacker Kyle Emanuel announced his retirement from the NFL in a Twitter post.
Selected by the San Diego Chargers in the fifth round of the 2015 NFL Draft, Emanuel spent four years with the franchise. He appeared in 63 games for the Chargers. A Nebraska native, he played at FCS powerhouse North Dakota State.
He played out his four-year, $2.5 million rookie contract and had visited the Detroit Lions and had drawn other interest from other teams, according to multiple reports. Emanuel ends his career with 147 tackles (11 for loss), 10 quarterback hits, four sacks and two interceptions.
--Cincinnati Bengals running back Mark Walton surrendered to police in Florida, marking his third arrest of 2019.
The Miami Herald reported that Walton was arrested on felony charges of carrying a concealed weapon, along with marijuana possession and reckless driving in connection with an incident that occurred March 12 in North Miami-Dade.
On Feb. 16, he was arrested and charged with misdemeanor battery in Florida after what police reportedly said stemmed from an argument he had with a couple at his condominium complex over his car blocking the entrance to a parking garage. He also was arrested on a misdemeanor marijuana possession charge in January and is awaiting trial.
--The New York Jets confirmed they will play the 2019 season and beyond with new uniforms, helmets and logos.
The team revealed the new look on its Twitter account, marking the first uniform change for the franchise since 1998, calling it the ""beginning of a new legacy.""
The Jets called their new colors ""Gotham Green, Spotlight White and Stealth Black.""

MINNEAPOLIS — Here it was, the first Final Four appearance for Texas Tech, and a recipe for disaster was unfolding. The Red Raiders’ best player, Jarrett Culver, was missing in action, unable to locate his shot or his confidence. Their most dynamic player, Tariq Owens, had injured his ankle and had to be helped off the court. Their double-digit lead had been cut to a single point.
No matter, though, for Texas Tech.
The Red Raiders leaned on their defense, a deep reservoir of resolve and the cocksure shooting of guard Matt Mooney to hold off Michigan State, 61-51, and advance to the N.C.A.A. championship game on Monday night.
Texas Tech (31-6) will meet Virginia (34-3), which stunned Auburn and, like the Red Raiders, will be making its first trip to the title game.
[
Read about Virginia’s victory over Auburn here.
]
Helping Texas Tech through was Mooney, who scored 22 points — including three second half 3-pointers — and a defense that has carried the team this far.
And then, when Texas Tech needed him most, Culver delivered too, scoring two baskets late, including a 3-pointer from the top of the arc that pushed the Red Raiders lead to 58-51 with 58 seconds left and repelled the final Michigan State charge.
“We threw a lot of punches out there tonight,” Texas Tech Coach Chris Beard said. “We battled. We contested.”
Michigan State was the only team to arrive at this year’s Final Four that might have been expected not to have jitters. Texas Tech and Auburn had never before reached a Final Four, and Virginia had not been since 1984. But the Spartans are almost placeholders in the event, having been eight times in the last 21 seasons under their hall of fame coach, Tom Izzo.
They have won only once in that span, however, and that title in 2000 is now a long-ago bookend to the championship Magic Johnson delivered in 1979.
The Spartans’ star point guard, Cassius Winston, who had played so splendidly throughout the tournament for Michigan State, was held largely in check by Texas Tech’s stifling defense. Though he led the Spartans with 16 points, he made only 4 of 16 shots and had twice as many turnovers (4) as assists (2). Kenny Goins, who made the game-winning shot to beat Duke, did not score at all.
The 51 points were a season low for Michigan State, which followed Gonzaga, Michigan, Buffalo and Northern Kentucky in being shackled by the Red Raiders.
“In general, the tougher team won,” Izzo said. “Give them credit. I really appreciate how hard his guys play. My guys hung in there, but our two seniors struggled tonight. They gave us so many great moments, but tonight wasn’t one of them.”
If Saturday’s first national semifinal was always going to be a study in contrasts — Virginia’s methodical precision against Auburn’s organized chaos — the second game was not.
Michigan State, which has long built its identity around mental and physical toughness — Izzo used to have his players put on football helmets and shoulder pads for rebounding drills — met its rare equal in Texas Tech.
The Red Raiders have hung their hard hats on a grinding defense that is rated as the most efficient in the nation,
according to KenPom metrics
. In a typical 90-minute practice, the players said, 60 are spent on defense.
On Saturday night, Texas Tech, with its persistent switching, relentless movement and extended arms made every pass a chore for Michigan State. And when the Spartans did manage to work the ball inside, Owens — a spindly 6-foot-10 senior with a 41-inch vertical leap — regularly contested shots at the rim.
But when Owens swatted away a drive to the basket by Winston early in the second half, his third block, he rolled his ankle as he landed and crumpled in a heap. Owens was helped off the court, favoring his right leg, and taken to the locker room.
He came back out of the tunnel and returned to the bench with about eight minutes to play, bringing the Texas Tech crowd to its feet. They roared again when Owens checked in with 6:52 left, but the lift he gave the Red Raiders was mostly spiritual.
With Owens immobile and Culver ineffective, the reserves Brandone Frances and Kyler Edwards kept the Red Raiders afloat with drives to the basket until Mooney took over.
A
graduate transfer
who began his career at Air Force and South Dakota before arriving in Lubbock, Mooney made three 3-pointers during a three-minute stretch, the final one giving the Red Raiders their biggest lead, at 48-35.
“All year long we’d have different guys step up and Jarrett’s a special player,” said Mooney, who had received a nudge from the assistant coach Glenn Cyprien to be more aggressive. “He said: ‘It’s your time. Other guys aren’t finding their shot right now, you’ve got to take over this game.’ You don’t tell me twice to shoot the ball.”
But the Spartans, as Auburn had against Virginia in the first game, crept back.
And just after Mooney missed a driving layup, Aaron Henry knifed through the lane at the other end to bring Michigan State within a point, at 52-51, with 2:52 to play.
It was a surge reminiscent of the one Gonzaga made against Texas Tech in the West Region final.
“Stay poised, be tough,” Norense Odiase, who did not take a shot but grabbed nine rebounds, said of the mind-set his teammates carried down the stretch. “Everything that helped us get to this point, we can’t just let it go to waste just because in this game they made a run.”
And so the Red Raiders stiffened. Culver, who did not score his first basket until 9:01 remained and missed 9 of his first 10 shots, scored on a jumper just outside the lane to push the advantage back to 54-51.
Then Davide Moretti drew a charge from Winston, and Matt McQuaid missed a 3-pointer. Xavier Tillman missed the front end of a 1-and-1 and then was stripped by Odiase.
It was then left to Culver to deliver the final blow, dribbling down the shot clock and knocking down his 3-pointer. As he did, he gestured to the Red Raiders’ crowd, which included its most well-known athletic alum, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes.
As unlikely and improbable as it might have seemed, Texas Tech was headed to the title game.

MINNEAPOLIS — Joshua Langford, a Michigan State guard, remembered the first time he saw more than an inch of snow. It was two years ago, during his freshman year in East Lansing. An Alabama native, he awoke one morning to find a campus absolutely covered in the stuff.
“Bro, they’re probably going to cancel class,” he told his roommate, the former Spartans star Miles Bridges.
Recalling his education in the winters of the Upper Midwest, he deadpanned this week: “They didn’t cancel class.”
These days, Langford remains one of the odd men out, a rare Michigan State player who did not grow up no more than a half-day’s drive from campus. In fact, 10 of the 16 players on the roster of this year’s Spartans, a No. 2 seed that faces third-seeded Texas Tech in a national semifinal on Saturday night, played high school basketball in the state of Michigan. Among its 12 players receiving scholarships, seven did.
With Langford out since January with a knee injury, the Spartans’ most recent two games — impressive wins over Louisiana State and Duke — have featured Michiganders playing more than 57 percent of the minutes.
“If we could have 13 guys from Michigan, that’s what Coach Izzo would like,” said Dwayne Stephens, Michigan State’s associate head coach.
Stephens is from Michigan, as are the other two assistants, the recruiting coordinator and Iron Mountain’s own Tom Izzo.
“In Michigan you don’t have all the publicity, all that type of thing,” said the star point guard Cassius Winston, a junior from Detroit. “You want to come to a place like Michigan State, where you’ve got to grind, you’ve got to work for everything.”
Yet in the age of national and international recruiting, the prominent men’s basketball team of a public university being dominated by players from its good-size state is more unusual than one might think.
Unlike football recruiting, which has remained somewhat regional, the best basketball teams these days draw players from everywhere. Thanks to summer leagues, the best players congregate in April and July showcases in a few cities near large airports in front of coaches from across the country. Even the 10 or 12 most prominent programs in the country — a classification that definitely includes Michigan State — sign only a combined few dozen players every year, so they can afford to chase after the best.
The in-state talent comprising 62.5 percent of the Michigan State roster, then, stands out.
At public-school programs similar in pedigree to Michigan State, this ratio tends to be much lower: 3 of 15 at Kansas; 1 of 12 at Kentucky (or two if you count the walk-on Brad Calipari, the coach’s son, who went to high school in New Jersey); 6 of 17 at North Carolina.
Nor is this some Big Ten occurrence. At Ohio State, the equivalent figure is 6 of 14. At Wisconsin, it’s 4 of 18. At Indiana, it’s 7 of 17.
In fact, of a semi-random assortment of 20 prominent state-school basketball teams, only Washington’s and Georgia’s had instate-to-out-of-state ratios similar to Michigan State’s. Only 6 of the 15 players on the Red Raiders roster Michigan State will face on Saturday are from Texas.
The trend is not new: For years, Michigan State’s biggest stars have almost all been Mitten Staters. Winston was Michigan’s Mr. Basketball at the University of Detroit Jesuit High School. Bridges, who was the 12th overall pick in the N.B.A. draft last year, is from Flint, though he played high school basketball in several states. Denzel Valentine is from Lansing, Draymond Green and Jason Richardson from Saginaw.
Dane Fife, another Michigan State associate head coach (and a former Michigan Mr. Basketball), is the son of a longtime high school coach in Clarkston. He said the kinship among players in the locker room (which also includes two Ohioans and one player from Indiana) has real competitive advantages. “There is a sense of loyalty not just to your school,” he said.
The biggest drawback to focusing on Michigan basketball in recruiting is the condition of Michigan basketball. It has seen better days.
For one thing, there are simply fewer people in Michigan than there used to be. The eighth-largest state by population in the 1990 census, it most likely will drop to 10th after next year’s, partly related to the travails of the auto industry. In the last five years, the best recruit from the state of Michigan was never ranked higher than No. 26 in 247Sports’s composite rankings.
Several Michigan State players and coaches said that another problem is Michigan High School Athletic Association rules limiting teams from traveling to national tournaments, causing an adverse impact on Michigan high school basketball and, indirectly, on Michigan State recruiting.
For instance, Detroit’s Josh Jackson, the top class of 2015 recruit nationally, played prep-school basketball elsewhere before his single season at Kansas.
“The M.H.S.A.A., the people that run the high school basketball, they have some old rules that definitely need to be updated,” said the freshman Foster Loyer, last year’s Michigan Mr. Basketball. “It is causing some higher-level talent to leave the state.”
Mark Uyl, the state association’s executive director, said in an interview that several states had similar travel rules, which in Michigan’s case allow teams to travel only to neighboring states (plus Illinois) or trips of no more than 300 miles in one direction.
“The 748 high schools that make up our membership believe that we found a pretty good balance of letting schools be able to travel to find some of the best competition in the Midwest, while keeping some academic balance,” Uyl said.
The Michigan State staff’s attitude toward the rules was pretty clear. “Hopefully,” Stephens said, “some things will change.”
Another potential obstacle to Michigan State’s ability to recruit in its own state has actually become an advantage. This is the presence of another public university, one located more proximately to the state population’s center of gravity and one that considers itself far more glamorous than its land-grant sibling.
It is possible you have heard of the University of Michigan, particularly if you have ever met anyone who went there.
But though Michigan has been to two national championship games since Michigan State last appeared in one, it is the Spartans — over the nearly quarter-century that Izzo has been Michigan State’s head coach — who have won a national title and made eight Final Fours, never going more than five seasons without playing in the N.C.A.A. tournament’s final weekend.
It may be the Wolverine State, but only seven of Michigan’s 16 players this season — and only four of its 12 scholarship players — were from Michigan.
To today’s teenagers, born several years after the Fab Five left Ann Arbor, Michigan’s dominant program is not the one in maize and blue.
“You grow up in Michigan,” said Braden Burke, a walk-on from Stevensville, “you want to play for Michigan State.”

More riders are using battery-powered bikes on group cycling tours,
creating their own set of tensions and hand-wringing over the artificial advantage.
By
Patrick Scott
On a cycling tour along the coast of southwest Sardinia, Kathleen Robinson thanked God she was riding an electric bike up the winding heights. But she wished she’d had a class beforehand on the proper etiquette.
She didn’t realize that the hum of her motor would annoy some of the traditional cyclists on the tour, nor was she certain whether to spin in the back of the pack or move out front. Mrs. Robinson, 60, had enough sense to gloat tactically, like when she sailed past a friend grinding up a hill and “gave him my Queen Elizabeth wave.”
“There wasn’t a problem as long as I didn’t stay next to someone who was struggling hard,” she said.
Over the last two years, bike tour companies large and small have seen a spike in demand for e-bikes, and have ramped up their battery-powered fleets and the equipment needed to haul the heavier machines. The bikes now are used by 10 to 30 percent of riders on tours, operators said, and that percentage is only increasing.
“E-bikes are revolutionizing bike tours,” said Maria Elena Price, co-owner of
ExperiencePlus! Bicycle Tours
, which offers itineraries in 20 countries.
Pedaling kick starts an e-bike’s motors, which cut off at 20 miles per hour in the United States and about 15 mph in Europe. Riding an e-bike can feel like having wind at your back or a pair of bionic legs. That has opened tours to noncyclists who are less fit, people once sidelined by injury and older cyclists looking to extend their riding days. Like a marriage counselor, they unite couples who once vacationed separately or joined bike tours reluctantly.
But as with many innovations in sports — think high-tech racing suits for swimmers and sticky gloves for football players — e-bikes have created their own set of tensions and hand-wringing over the artificial advantage.
While most on the tours say e-bikes make for more harmonious rides with fewer stressed-out stragglers, the bikes have also given rise to incessant corny jokes — “I didn’t think that hill was that hard,” said the e-biker — and no shortage of muttered obscenities from drained riders as e-bikers nonchalantly breeze by.
ExperiencePlus!, which is based in Colorado, limited e-bikes to two per trip until 2017, when requests multiplied, Ms. Price said.
Guides now have an orientation script explaining that e-bikes are “not mini-mopeds,” and asking e-bikers “to respect your fellow push-bike riders as you pass them effortlessly on a climb, and for those of you on push bikes to not look ‘down’ on the e-bikers.”
Rarely does a guide need to reprimand a rider, said Alain Rimondi, a tour leader for ExperiencePlus! in Italy. But when the sides are evenly mixed, he said, “it turns into an interesting social experiment.”
At the start, e-bikers can feel a bit guilty switching on the motor, he said. In the first days they tend to fly past the others, especially on hills, and some even arrive early for lunch. Later, e-bikers usually hang back and the group is more compact.
At the end of rides, the
e-bike riders
are happy and refreshed from their workout, he said, and push-bike riders often ask if they can try an e-bike.
Battery-powered bikes were invented more than a century ago. But they remained a clunky oddity until this decade, taking hold on
riding tours first in Europe
, which has an expansive bike culture, then spreading to the United States.
Norman Patry, the owner of
Summer Feet Cycling
in Maine, said he was too far ahead of the curve when he bought a dozen e-bikes six years ago. They gathered dust and he stopped promoting them on his website.
Now, the sector is full of energy.
“Everybody who is in the biking space is talking about it and thinking about it,” Mr. Patry said. “We’re past the point where they’re wondering if they’re going to do it; everybody thinks they need to do it now.” He’s replacing his fleet this year.
The costs can be substantial: E-bikes typically run at least double the price of a regular hybrid touring bike, with outfitters generally paying $1,500 to $3,000 for one e-bike.
One of the larger tour operators, Vermont-based
VBT Bicycling and Walking Vacations
, has invested more than $1 million in e-bikes, said Ray Hourani, head of global operations.
In a five-year plan created in 2016, VBT projected 12 percent of bookings would be for e-bikes. It’s already at 30 percent, he said.
That’s brought new challenges. Hundreds of new e-bikes required dozens of custom-made trailers to support them. And guides in Europe needed a special driver’s license to transport the heavier loads.
The staff at
Bicycle Adventures
of Redmond, Wash., had seemingly endless debates when it tested e-bikes six years ago. According to Todd Starnes, the owner, they argued whether e-bikes were cheating, how e-bikers would be treated, if the tour makeup would be changed and more.
The verdict? “In some ways, I think it makes the trip a little better,” Mr. Starnes said.
For one, tours begin with less anxious questions about distance and elevation.
“The person on the e-bike is less concerned at that point about whether they can keep up and more concerned about what the others think about them being on an e-bike,” Mr. Starnes said. “And they soon learn that nobody cares.”
E-bikes also make it easier for guides; less sheep-dogging laggards who delay the rest of the group.
“Everybody is at lunch at the same time,” Mr. Starnes said.
An e-bike was the solution for Hope and Richard Wilson last fall. Mrs. Wilson had pinched a nerve in her leg, but her husband had his mind set on a foliage cycling tour in Maine with three other couples.
“It made it a lot more fun when you can keep up,” Mrs. Wilson, 57, said. “You’re going by beautiful estates and beautiful landscape and you get to share it with somebody instead of lagging at the back.”
Joe DeYoung, a former amateur racer who leads rides on parts of the Tour de France route, is in favor of e-bikes, but not for himself.
He remembers straining up the legendary Mont Ventoux in France last year, then hearing humming and seeing two e-bikes blow past him.
“About a mile from the top, where it really gets steep, they ran out of batteries and I went by them,” Mr. DeYoung, 67, said. “I got my revenge.”
But as more commuters and recreational cyclists embrace e-bikes, and as technological advances continue to make them cheaper and sleeker, the influx on bike tours is likely to continue.
“As the baby boomers get older, they’ll need them,” said Jim Johnson, the owner of
BikeTours.com
of Chattanooga
.
“As the millennials start needing knee-replacement surgery, they’ll need them, too.”

He was the government’s official photographer at Oak Ridge, Tenn., a secret city where uranium was enriched for the bomb that fell on Hiroshima.
By
Richard Sandomir
Ed Westcott, a photographer who documented life in Oak Ridge, Tenn., the secret city where uranium was enriched as part of the Manhattan Project to develop the atom bomb during World War II, died on March 29 at his daughter’s home in Oak Ridge, where he also still lived. He was 97.
His daughter, Emily Hunnicutt, confirmed his death. Mr. Westcott had a stroke in 2005 that limited his ability to speak.
Not then on any maps,
Oak Ridge
during the war was a huge company town of
59,000 acres about 25 miles west of Knoxville. Ringed by barbed wire, it had factories dedicated to bomb production, homes for tens of thousands of workers and their families, a 300-mile network of roads, and schools, stores, restaurants, theaters, parks and a library. Those who left town were searched for firearms on their return. People who talked openly about their classified work faced fines or prison.
Within that hush-hush world, Mr. Westcott took his camera wherever he could, chronicling the construction of its many plants (which had names like K-25 and Y-12), technicians at their stations, workers leaving their shifts, and even guards searching a Santa Claus at a gate. Mr. Westcott was the only person authorized to use a camera in Oak Ridge.
One of his best-known pictures shows
women monitoring the controls of a calutron
, which was used to separate uranium isotopes. Like the other workers, they were unaware of the government’s goal of building the first atomic bomb.
He depicted the everyday life of a self-contained world: children clambering on a nursery school jungle gym; black workers in their grim segregated housing; a high school football practice; customers lined up for food rations
food at a grocery store; music lovers attending an Oak Ridge Symphony concert; and teenagers playing Ping-Pong.
“Ed’s photographs are a treasure trove for people interested in what it was like to live in secret cities and who these people were,”
Cindy Kelly, president of the Atomic Heritage Foundation
, said in a telephone interview.
Mr. Westcott was one of three official photographers at the Manhattan Project’s secret locations. The others were at the weapons laboratory at Los Alamos, N.M.,
led by
J. Robert Oppenheimer
, and at Hanford, Wash., where plutonium was produced.
“They were all put in this bizarre situation — photographing, for purposes they had no idea of, a cataclysmic event,” said Esther Samra who co-wrote, with Rachel Fermi,
“Picturing the Bomb: Photographs from the Secret World of the Manhattan Project” (1995). “So they went about their days, photographing the things any press photographer would photograph.” (Ms. Fermi is one of four grandchildren of Enrico Fermi, who directed the first controlled chain reaction using nuclear fission.)
But even if Mr. Westcott was documenting a city that the public could not see — and moreover was often being told what not to shoot — there was a point to the picture-taking, especially for
Lt. Gen. Leslie R. Groves Jr.
, the director of the Manhattan Project.
“Groves planned to extract maximum publicity benefit from the project for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers if and when it succeeded,” Richard Rhodes, whose book “The Making of the Atomic Bomb” (1986) won a Pulitzer Prize, wrote in an email. “For that, he needed photographs, again, within the limits of security. Thus, Westcott’s assignment.”
Indeed, two days after attending the successful test of the atomic bomb on July 16, 1945, in the New Mexico desert, General Groves had Mr. Westcott come up to Washington to photograph him in his office. The picture became part of a publicity packet that was distributed to the press after Hiroshima was bombed on Aug. 6.
“He seemed high strung and nervous,” Mr. Westcott said in an interview with the Nashville newspaper The Tennessean in December 1945. “There were all sorts of telephone calls and secret conversations. After the official news was released later” — about the bombs’ being dropped — “I was told that the general had been talking to Dr. Oppenheimer and making arrangements to deliver the atomic bomb to the air forces and have it dropped on Japan.”
Three days after the blast at Hiroshima, the entire front page of the local newspaper, The Oak Ridge Journal, was devoted to articles about it. Along with a banner headline —
“Oak Ridge Attacks Japanese”
— was one of Mr. Westcott’s photographs of General Groves.
Thousands of his negatives were stored at Oak Ridge, and then at the National Archives in Washington, before they were declassified years later.
He also developed aerial reconnaissance photos of the devastation wrought by the bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as armed guards waited outside his darkroom.
James Edward Westcott was born on Jan. 20, 1922, in Chattanooga, Tenn., and grew up in Nashville. His father, Jamie, was an accountant at the Louisville & Nashville Railroad. His mother, Lucille (Green) Westcott, was a homemaker.
Ed’s interest in photography took him as a teenage amateur to Nashville in the early 1930s to shoot, for himself, a whirlwind appearance by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He soon learned to develop pictures and built his own darkroom. After high school, he worked at local photo studios and for the National Youth Administration, taking pictures of the Works Progress Administration’s efforts in Nashville.
He joined the Army Corps of Engineers in early 1942, photographing the construction of hydroelectric plants, dams and military bases in the Southeast. Later that year he was asked by the Corps to choose between two new postings: Alaska or what would become Oak Ridge. He chose the latter because of his knowledge of east Tennessee.
When he arrived, there was little to suggest the massive complex it would become.
“We came under an underpass, which was called ‘Elza,’ and then they said, ‘This is the project,’ ” he told The Tennessean. “I didn’t see anything going on and didn’t see how it could be a project.”
Mr. Westcott moved into a small prefabricated house — a model
called a Cemesto A
— with his wife, Edith (Seigenthaler) Westcott, and his son, James Jr. When the Wescotts had more children, they moved into a larger, Cemesto D, house, which he modernized and lived in for the next 65 years.
Oak Ridge — which would become a thriving city (minus the barbed fencing) — was used after the war for government research under the United States Atomic Energy Commission, and Mr. Westcott remained as the official photographer. In 1966, he turned to documenting the commission’s activities at its headquarters in Germantown, Md. He returned to live in Oak Ridge in 1977, where he also did some local photographic and darkroom work until his wife took sick. She died in 1996.
In addition to his daughter, Ms. Hunnicutt, Mr. Westcott is survived by his sons, James Jr., William, John and David; nine grandchildren; and 11 great-grandchildren.
In his later years he became a revered figure in Oak Ridge, where a street and shopping center were named for him. The local congressman nominated him for the
Presidential Medal of Freedom, and “Ed Westcott Day” was proclaimed there when he turned 96.
A few days before his death, he attended the grand opening of the Oak Ridge History Museum, where his photographs are on display. His pictures of the event were his last.
“He photographed the ribbon-cutting,” Ms. Hunnicutt said. “He had a wonderful day.”
An earlier version of this obituary misstated the location of Oak Ridge, Tenn. It is about 25 miles west of Knoxville, not east.
An earlier version of a picture caption with this obituary misstated part of the name of the museum where Mr. Westcott took his final pictures. As the obituary correctly states, it is the Oak Ridge History Museum, not the Oak Ridge Historical Museum.
An earlier version of an online summary with this obituary misstated how the uranium enriched in Oak Ridge, Tenn., was used. It was enriched only for the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima -- not for the bombs that fell on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Richard Sandomir is an obituaries writer. He previously wrote about sports media and sports business. He is also the author of several books, including “The Pride of the Yankees: Lou Gehrig, Gary Cooper and the Making of a Classic.”

The league didn’t actually try to steal Nashville’s gorgeous cherry trees, but it sure felt that way.
By
Margaret Renkl
Contributing Opinion Writer
NASHVILLE — Last Saturday morning, all across the city, Nashville residents woke up to news that seemed almost Orwellian — or if not Orwellian, then at least Onionian: City officials had decided to cut down 21 mature cherry trees in full bloom.
On less than 72 hours’ notice.
Because the National Football League asked them to.
The cherry trees in question line downtown’s First Avenue North, which runs along the Cumberland River and fronts Riverfront Park, site of the city’s grandest celebrations. Later this month that park will be where the N.F.L. holds its annual draft, an event that seems to require a giant stage the likes of which Nashville — and possibly all of Tennessee, maybe even the whole country — has never seen. Nashville, otherwise known as Music City, is pretty well set with stages, but apparently none of them is sufficiently grand to suit the N.F.L. Better to chop down a bunch of living trees and build an even grander stage, and all for a three-day event that may be moved indoors anyway. Perhaps you’ve heard of April showers?
The ironies here abound. Just last October, Nashville’s mayor, David Briley,
announced a major initiative to plant 500,000 trees
by 2050 — an effort to replace the roughly 9,000 trees the city is losing each year to its explosive growth. But the trees in question here hadn’t been lost at all. They are mature Yoshino cherry trees, the same trees that bloom so extravagantly along the mall in Washington during the National Cherry Blossom Festival. And Nashville’s own
Cherry Blossom Festival
, which National Geographic ranks as one of the best in the country, is set for April 13, less than two weeks after news broke that 21 of the 68 trees on First Avenue North would be destroyed.
The optics of this plan to kill the cherry trees are bad: Let’s kill some living trees so that we can put up a temporary stage to promote an organization that profits from a sport widely understood to cause grievous, long-term damage to the brains of its players. Those airy pink blossoms with petals that float on the wind and fall on our shoulders like a benediction? Let’s cut them down for the sake of a blood sport.
Nashvillians erupted with fury. Conservation groups like the Nashville Tree Foundation and the Nashville Tree Conservation Corps mobilized their followers, who sent up a great alarm that quickly rippled across Facebook and Twitter and from there to local, and then national, news outlets.
A Change.org petition posted at 9 o’clock on Saturday morning racked up thousands of signatures — more than 61,000 by Sunday afternoon — and city officials were scrambling to respond, at first announcing that the 21 trees would be dug up and relocated in the city, and then reconfiguring the plan itself so that only 10 trees would be moved, leaving all the trees on First Avenue itself in place. “In our own brand promise, we talk about protecting the authenticity of the city,” Butch Spryidon, the chief executive of the Nashville Convention and Visitors Corp.,
said in a public apology
on Sunday. “I think it’s a balance. I think it’s a good reminder of that balance. Lesson learned. Hard lesson learned.”
Well, no. A lesson truly learned would have meant moving that stage. Mature trees can with great effort be transplanted successfully under ideal circumstances, but these are not ideal circumstances. Their roots lie under a public walkway paved with bricks, a location that makes it difficult to remove enough of the root structure for successful relocation. And transplanting a tree once it has already begun to bud out in spring, just before the stress of summer heat, makes the challenges to its survival even greater. Moving these trees, in other words, is just a more expensive way to kill them.
We have bigger problems in this city than the loss of 10 cherry trees. Our school board is
completely dysfunctional
. Our state legislature,
in thrall to the Koch network
, is energetically working to undercut every progressive law Nashville passes. A recent investigation by The Tennessean, the city’s daily newspaper, revealed that Tennessee has
surreptitiously cut 128,000 children from state health-insurance rolls
during the past two years. More than 14,000 of those kids live in Nashville.
And it’s not as though the cherry trees are stately oaks that go back hundreds of years. They’re ornamentals, not shade trees, and their ideal habitat is Japan, not Tennessee. The benefits of a robust tree canopy in the urban core are well known by now: Trees mitigate the effects of greenhouse gasses, cool city sidewalks and streets, reduce energy costs for buildings, absorb and filter storm water. The cherry trees at Riverfront Park provide those benefits, no doubt, but there are many native trees that could do that work much better, equally beautifully, and with a longer life expectancy.
When the N.F.L. draft was held in Dallas last year, it inspired some $74 million in visitor spending, according to the Nashville Convention and Visitors Corp., so it’s easy to see why city officials gave the cherry trees so little thought. These people are not villains. They aren’t sitting in a bunker plotting to steal Nashville’s trees. They aren’t thinking about trees at all. They’re thinking about landing a deal to bring a bunch of spending money to downtown Nashville, a city with a cash-flow problem so troubling that last year it reneged on a promised cost-of-living increase for city employees. (Mayor Briley’s proposed budget for the 2019-2020 fiscal year restores those raises.)
But sometimes good intentions can be as harmful as villainy. There is no “authenticity to the city” left in downtown Nashville anymore. Lower Broad is a neon wasteland of rooftop bars and pedal taverns and motorized scooters and horse-drawn carriages in the shape of Cinderella’s pumpkin and a terrible new rolling atrocity called the Music City Party Tub. Such tourist attractions are to the real Nashville what Las Vegas is to the pristine sands of the Mojave Desert before white people found it.
Nashvillians are not alone in finding their own city unrecognizable, in getting lost on once-familiar routes because longtime landmarks are gone and monstrous new buildings have risen, seemingly overnight, where they once stood. All across the country, in growing cities like Austin and Burlington and Charlotte and Denver, people are looking around and wondering if they still belong in the place where they actually live. We all have the same secret fear: What if this town we love so much is just the next Atlanta?
We are tired of not being able to walk on our own sidewalks because a construction site is sprawled directly across it. We are tired of the outside developers and rental-property “investors” who bid up the prices of our houses so high that local families can’t afford them. We are tired of watching our elected leaders giving all manner of incentives to outside corporations but offering no helping hand at all to the small businesses that are trying so hard to survive in the “New Nashville.”
Most of all we are sick, sick, sick of sitting in traffic. Years ago, people around here put funny bumper stickers on their cars that read: “Welcome to Nashville. Now y’all go home.” We aren’t laughing anymore. We’re sitting in our motionless cars and scrolling through Twitter, learning that when the N.F.L. said, “Just cut down these gorgeous cherry trees and we’ll bring our draft to Nashville,” the people who run this city smiled and said: “Sure. No problem. How many trees do you need?”

Have you ever felt like an outsider, or as if you just didn’t fit in somewhere? Maybe it was at school, on a team, with a group of friends, in a public place or even in your own home?
If so, what was it that made you feel different? Was it your race, ethnicity, gender or sexuality? Maybe it was it your economic status, political views, religious beliefs, nationality or language? Perhaps your ability, cultural values, personality or interests? Or maybe it was something else entirely?
What was that experience like for you? In general, did you enjoy standing out, or did you find it challenging?
In “
On Being an Outsider
,” Christina Thompson writes about her children’s experiences of feeling like outsiders because of their mixed ethnicity:
Before I had any children of my own, I spent a decade and a half living in places where I was an outsider. While I never lost the feeling of estrangement that comes from missing basic cultural cues, for me this was a period of great liberation. I loved the freedom that being a stranger gave me. I loved the fact that people were unable to “place” me and that I was also largely free of preconceptions about them. …
When we began having children — three boys in seven years — I was excited by the idea that our kids were going to have a complex identity. It would begin simply with the way they looked. My husband is dark, I am fair, our children are a range of in-between. They all have dark eyes, dark hair, neither curly nor straight, and skin that is light in winter and goes brown quickly in the sun. Ethnically speaking, they are quite difficult to place; over the years they have been mistaken for Latino, Iranian, Turkish, Pakistani, half-Korean, half-Japanese.
I loved the idea that our children were ethnically ambiguous. I saw this as their passport to freedom and viewed our boys as citizens of the world. I wasn’t sure how long it would take them to understand it, but I was confident that the rich complexity of their ancestry would become apparent to them in time. It never crossed my mind that it could be anything other than a bonus. …
Our three sons are now grown, and it recently occurred to me to ask about their experience of being hapa. Some of what they told me came as a surprise.
One of my sons described his childhood in terms of being “culturally unmoored.” “We were like expats,” he said, which, in fact, we were for much of his early life.
But it was a feeling that stuck, even after we moved back to live with my family in Boston. He always felt that we were different from the people around us, an experience he likened to being “not quite a native speaker.”
He conceded that being different was in some ways an asset, in that people were interested in him, but also that “it makes the game harder.” When you’re different, he said, you stand out, regardless of whether you want to or not. “Not everyone is suited to it,” he observed.
This was certainly the case for another of my sons. “From the first day of school,” he told me, “I felt different from my classmates.” He described this as a “slightly bad feeling” and said he’d been bullied, something he’d never told me before. For him, difference was not an advantage, it was a burden, and his looks, which are somewhat exotic, were “a card you could play but don’t really want to.” He, too, acknowledged that this exoticism could be an asset, but it was not one he had ever wanted and the price he’d had to pay for it was steep.
My third son had an entirely different take. By the time he was in middle school, he told me, he had recognized that being unusual gave him a social advantage. “I knew it was something that was cool,” he said. He told me that he got a kick out of the fact that people couldn’t pronounce his surname (something that caused his brother endless misery) and observed that the social cred effect had only increased with age.
And in “
Some College Students Choose a School Where They Don’t Fit, on Purpose
,” Kyle Spencer writes about college students who purposely attend colleges where they stand out:
Amir Goldberg, an associate professor of organizational behavior at Stanford University Graduate School of Business, who studies outsiders inside the workplace, says being an outsider can cause culture shock. But that doesn’t have to be a bad thing.
“If you have support, that shock can be translated into an advantage,” he said.
That was the case for Jonah Shainberg, a fencer from Rye, N.Y., who is Jewish. When he was accepted to Notre Dame, a football-heavy Catholic university in Indiana, his mother balked at the idea.
“I’m not sending my Jewish son to Notre Dame,” Mr. Shainberg recalled her saying. He was also skeptical.
But once he was there, Mr. Shainberg, who graduated this year with a bachelor’s degree in business administration, discovered something about himself he had not totally understood before: His faith was central to his identity.
“I think Notre Dame made me more Jewish,” he said.
For Elyse Hutcheson, 21, the opposite was true. Her time at Hillsdale College, a Christian college in Hillsdale, Mich., helped her get in touch with her views on reproductive rights, immigration and social welfare programs.
When she arrived, she said, “I knew I wasn’t a conservative, but I didn’t know I was a liberal.” By her junior year, she had re-energized a defunct club for campus Democrats and realized she was agnostic.
She graduated this year with a degree in psychology and art and took a job as a research assistant at Brown University, a liberal-leaning college in Providence, R.I.
While Ms. Hutcheson admits it’s a relief to now be around like-minded thinkers, she says fitting in comes with its own pitfalls.
“I don’t want to become complacent because the ideas I have aren’t being questioned anymore,” she said.
Students, choose one of the articles to read in its entirety, then tell us:
— Have you ever felt like an outsider somewhere? What made you feel different from the people around you? What was that experience like for you? How do you feel about it now?
— Have you ever purposely put yourself in the position of being an outsider somewhere? Why did you do it? What did you learn from the experience?
— In the second article, Nikki Bruno, an admissions coach in New Jersey, says being an outsider isn’t for everyone. Students should have an “adventurous spirit” and seem particularly confident before she would suggest an environment that is outside their comfort zone. Do you have that “adventurous spirit”? Do you prefer standing out or fitting in? Do you thrive when you are around people who are more similar to you or different from you? Why do you think that is?
— If you had the chance to be an outsider somewhere — say, to live in a foreign country or attend a college with people who have very different beliefs than you — would you take it? What do you think might be gained from doing this? What do you think would be challenging about it? Over all, do you think it would be a positive or negative experience for you? Why?

ELLISVILLE, Miss. — Bailey Davis, the former Saints cheerleader who last spring took on the N.F.L. and one of New Orleans’s most beloved institutions, has had quite a year.
Appearances with high-profile personalities in television turned her into a feminist folk hero after she complained about being fired for posting a photograph of herself in a lacy outfit. Yet those actions also made her the target of online attacks, not only from angry men, but also from cheerleaders who say she has made it harder for them to do their jobs.
“It’s, ‘You got what you were asking for, you whore,’ or ‘You knew what you signed up for, you slut,’” Davis said in an interview at her home, about a two-hour drive north of New Orleans. “It’s completely degrading to me as a person and to women everywhere.”
When Davis filed a sex discrimination case last year in late March against the Saints, accusing the team of having two standards, one for cheerleaders and another for players, she assumed few people would notice. As a cheerleader, she danced on the sideline on game days in front of tens of thousands of people but was largely anonymous.
Notice they did.
Davis has been besieged with news media requests from countries as far away as Germany and India, but also shunned by many friends and by her fellow cheerleaders. Her experience echoes those of others who have spoken out during the #MeToo movement and demonstrates the pitfalls of going against powerful institutions like the N.F.L. and its teams.
“We weren’t sure if anybody was going to be interested in it or if it was even going to matter,” Davis said of her complaint.
Davis, 23, spent much of her childhood in a small town in Mississippi aspiring to be an N.F.L. cheerleader. She was not surprised that the Saints adamantly denied discriminating against women or that they threatened to sue her for defamation. A year on, the team and the former cheerleader continue to argue the case in front of an arbitrator, who will determine whether she is eligible for damages. Sara Blackwell, Davis’s lawyer, said she believed the arbitrator would rule by summer.
“I don’t want to have to be dealing with this lawsuit,” Davis said. “But I have to remind myself I’m doing it for the cheerleaders, and for this culture to change.”
Greg Bensel, a Saints spokesman, declined to comment about the case or to make an executive available to discuss the accusations against the team.
Still, Davis’s calling out the Saints has led teams to re-evaluate their cheerleader squads. The
Saints have given their cheerleaders more modest, one-piece outfits
, ditched their annual swimsuit calendars and
hired their first male cheerleader
.
“Now they look like Rockettes,”
Gayle Benson, the owner of the Saints
, told The New Orleans Times-Picayune in reference to the more restrained uniforms. “They look like professional dancers … rather than other things.”
The Washington Redskins,
who have been accused by some cheerleaders of sexually exploiting them
on a 2013 trip to Costa Rica, also
chose more conservative uniforms
for their cheerleaders. The Indianapolis
Colts cheerleaders now wear less revealing uniforms
, which show no bare midriffs.
Six former
cheerleaders with the Houston Texans sued the team
, accusing it of failing to pay them a minimum wage and of providing unsafe work conditions. The case was referred to an arbitrator. The Los Angeles Rams, who were not accused of any wrongdoing,
added two male cheerleaders to their squad
.
The N.F.L. rebuffed an offer by Davis’s lawyer to give its
teams free training on how to treat cheerleaders
more fairly. Davis and another cheerleader also offered to drop their cases if they could meet with Commissioner Roger Goodell. He demurred.
But Blackwell, the lawyer, was able to meet with Anna Isaacson, the N.F.L.’s senior vice president for social responsibility, and league lawyers. Several months after Davis’s story broke, the general counsels for the 32 N.F.L. teams discussed how to handle the accusations raised by cheerleaders. Among other things,
they considered whether to tone down the cheerleaders’ image
to make them more “family friendly,” according to Vanity Fair.
An N.F.L. spokesman, Brian McCarthy, said the teams, not the league, hired and managed cheerleaders.
In a statement, he added: “Last year, the league office worked with clubs that have cheerleaders and encouraged them to review their programs to ensure that they were both appropriate and lawful. Since then, it is our understanding clubs made changes, which include providing additional security for public appearances, providing revised social media policies and providing more organizational support for cheerleading directors
.”
Davis did not expect empathy from the N.F.L., but longtime squadmates were another story. After an initial flurry of “atta girl” text messages from members of the Saintsations, the Saints’ cheerleading team, she was deleted from cheerleader chat groups. Few of them called when Davis’s younger brother, Justin, was given a diagnosis of Stage 4 colon cancer last summer. Friends who were planning to visit Davis in Florida, where she was staying after she left the Saintsations, canceled their trip.
“They were texting me: ‘How could you do this? This is going to make us look bad,’” Davis said.
People hearing about her story from a distance have been more supportive. Scores of women, including some former N.F.L. cheerleaders, have thanked her for sticking her neck out and pushing for equal treatment. Many of these women saw her on “Megyn Kelly Today,” “Full Frontal With Samantha Bee” or, most recently, “The Scarlet Letter Reports,” a Facebook Watch show hosted by Amanda Knox about women who have been publicly shamed.
Davis never imagined she would become a whistle-blower. But her dismissal by the Saints — ostensibly over a photograph she posted on Instagram that the team deemed too risqué, as well as accusations that she fraternized with a player — changed her attitude.
Her complaint exposed rules for cheerleaders that she said belonged to a bygone era. Davis said cheerleaders had to avoid contact with players, in person and online, even though players were not penalized for pursuing such engagement with cheerleaders. The cheerleaders had to block players from following them on social media and could not post photographs of themselves in Saints gear. They were told not to dine in the same restaurant as players, or to speak to them in any detail. If a Saints cheerleader entered a restaurant and a player was there, she had to leave. If a cheerleader was in a restaurant and a player arrived afterward, she had to leave.
After her three years on the sideline and many years of watching her mother work as a choreographer for the Saintsations, Davis’s love of the N.F.L. vanished. She recoils when she enters a restaurant and sees an N.F.L. game on a television there. She looks away when she sees fans wearing Saints jerseys and shirts. She walks out of the living room when her brother compartmentalizes her legal battle and watches the Saints on television.
Davis keeps a low profile most days. She dropped out of the University of Southern Mississippi, where she was studying communications, and works at her mother’s dance studio. She helps her mother care for her brother. She wants to return to performing, though not on an N.F.L. field.
For now, she is focused on finding balance after a tumultuous year. In January, she began a 21-day social media “cleansing” that included abstaining from checking her Instagram account. This has helped her avoid online bullies and reflect on why she filed her claim.
”Supporting the N.F.L. is supporting a culture that is discriminating to women, puts women down and is all about money and power,” she said. “The whole culture is so outdated.”

As commander of the coalition forces in Iraq, Maj. Gen. Walter Piatt juggled ruthless pursuit of enemies and delicate diplomacy with tribal leaders, using a trove of modern weaponry and streams of tech-generated data.
But his best decisions, he said, relied on a tool as ancient as it is powerful. Maj. Gen. Piatt often began daily operations by breathing deliberately, slack-jawed, staring steadily at a palm tree.
Mindfulness — the practice of using breathing techniques, similar to those in meditation, to gain focus and reduce distraction — is inching into the military in the United States and those of a handful of other nations.

This winter, Army infantry soldiers at Schofield Barracks in Hawaii began using mindfulness to improve shooting skills — for instance, focusing on when to pull the trigger amid chaos to avoid unnecessary civilian harm.
The British Royal Navy has given mindfulness training to officers, and military leaders are rolling it out in the Army and Royal Air Force for some officers and enlisted soldiers. The
New Zealand Defence Force
recently adopted the technique, and military forces of the Netherlands are considering the idea, too.
This week, NATO plans to hold a two-day symposium in Berlin to discuss the evidence behind the use of mindfulness in the military.
A small but growing group of military officials support the techniques to heal trauma-stressed veterans, make command decisions and help soldiers in chaotic battles.
“I was asked recently if my soldiers call me General Moonbeam,” said Maj. Gen. Piatt, who was director of operations for the Army and now commands its 10th Mountain Division. “There’s a stereotype this makes you soft. No, it brings you on point.”

The approach, he said, is based on
the work of Amishi Jha
, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Miami. She is the senior author of a paper published in December about the training’s effectiveness among members of a special operations unit.
The paper, in the journal Progress in Brain Research, reported that the troops who went through a monthlong training regimen that included daily practice in mindful breathing and focus techniques
were better able to discern key information under chaotic circumstances and experienced increases in working memory function
. The soldiers also reported making fewer cognitive errors than service members who did not use mindfulness.
The findings, which build on previous research showing improvements among soldiers and
professional football players
trained in mindfulness, are significant in part because members of the special forces are already selected for their ability to focus. The fact that even they saw improvement speaks to the power of the training, Dr. Jha said.
“They’re the best, and what they’re trying to do is the hardest,” she said.
Dr. Jha has spoken to the United States Army War College and the British Parliament, and she has been a consultant to New Zealand’s Defence Force and military officials in the Netherlands. “When the special forces do something,” she said, “not only does the rest of the U.S. military pay attention, but the rest of the world’s militaries pay attention.”
The science shows that techniques that focus and calm the mind allow people to perform better and make them less likely to overreact to incoming stimulation — whether a flash of movement, sound or an onslaught of information on a device.
The neuroscience of mindfulness involves, in part, strengthening a part of mental capacity known as “working memory” — a short-term, moment-to-moment catalog of tasks understood by scientists to effectively hold only a few pieces of information at one time.
As working memory clouds through overload, decisions become jumbled and reactions more impulsive. Breathing-induced focus lets people home in on the task at hand. But it does take practice.
The recent study found that service members who train for four weeks experience significant improvement, but those who train for only two weeks do not.
The mindfulness training comes as the military is exploring other options to intensify soldier focus, even the possibility of
implanting computer chips
into soldiers’ brains. But those potential solutions are expensive and years off.
Widespread adoption of mindfulness has challenges, including creating a staff of trainers, said Commander William MacNulty, a commissioned officer in the United States Public Health Service. He helped train a special forces unit in mindfulness (the precise military branch and location are confidential). The program entailed the soldiers spending about 15 minutes each day performing recorded, guided breathing exercises.
Mr. MacNulty said that about a third of the soldiers readily embraced the idea, a third engaged with curiosity, and a third seemed skeptical.
Mr. MacNulty likened the benefits of practicing mindfulness to those of, say, doing push-ups. “You might not drop and do push-ups when you’re in a gunfight, but you have increased capacity,” he said. That’s true of mindfulness, he added: Mental focus “becomes a transferable skill.”
In the newsmagazine of the Royal New Zealand Air Force, the military
explained the rationale behind adopting mindfulness
. Referring to the national rugby team, the magazine said: “The All Blacks talk about ‘red head/blue head’ — red head means being in a flustered state and blue head means being calm, centred and able to make clearheaded decisions.”
Research also has shown that use of mindfulness
can help soldiers overcome post-traumatic stress disorder
.
That has been the experience of Britain’s chief evangelist for use of mindfulness in the military, Commander
Tim Boughton
.
Mr. Boughton, decorated for service in many combat zones, discovered when he retired from active duty in 2008 that he’d grown withdrawn and angered by the horrors he’d seen: mangled civilian bodies fused together in combat zones; deaths of 48 compatriots in battle in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Falklands, Northern Ireland; “ethnic cleansing, hand-to-hand stuff.”
When he went to a psychiatrist in 2008, she broke down in tears after he described his experiences. Mr. Boughton discovered mindfulness after his own bout with PTSD, eventually becoming a trustee of the Oxford University Mindfulness Center.
He now starts and ends his day with five minutes of breathing exercises. He uses the technique each time he is gripped by anxiety or panic. The traumas haven’t disappeared, he said, but he isn’t haunted by them daily. Now he can more calmly examine each terrible incident, address it and have some control over it — rather than merely reacting.
“The amount of brain power it frees by not being trapped in the past or the future is incredible,” Mr. Boughton said. “The military is seeing the mass benefits of this.”
Mr. Boughton has thought about whether mindfulness is anathema to conflict. “The purists would say that mindfulness was never developed for war purpose,” he said.
What he means is that mindfulness is often associated with peacefulness. But, he added, the idea is to be as faithful to compassionate and humane ideals as possible given the realities of the job.
Maj. Gen. Piatt underscored that point, describing one delicate diplomatic mission in Iraq that involved meeting with a local tribal leader. Before the session, he said, he meditated in front of a palm tree, and found himself extremely focused when the delicate conversation took place shortly thereafter.
“I was not taking notes. I remember every word she was saying. I wasn’t forming a response, just listening,” he said. When the tribal leader finished, he said, “I talked back to her about every single point, had to concede on some. I remember the expression on her face: This is someone we can work with.”
In the end, he said, mindfulness allowed him to “reduce conflict by better understanding.”
“I’m not saying, be soft,” he added. “I’m saying, understand how compassion and empathy can be used for real advantages.”
“Peace takes a lot of hard work.”
An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the All Blacks. The phrase describes a prominent rugby team in New Zealand, not the national air force.

(Reuters) - The largest Democratic field in the modern political era is lining up to seek the party's 2020 presidential nomination - and is expected to keep growing.
The diverse group vying to challenge President Donald Trump, the likely Republican nominee, includes six U.S. senators. A record six women are running, as well as black, Hispanic and openly gay candidates who would make history if one of them became the party's nominee.
Here are the Democrats who have launched campaigns or are expected to pursue a presidential bid, listed in order of their RealClearPolitics national polling average for those who register in opinion surveys.
(For a graphic, see: tmsnrt.rs/2Ff62ZC)
JOE BIDEN
The leader in polls of Democratic presidential contenders is not even a candidate yet. But Biden, who served eight years as vice president under former President Barack Obama and 36 years in the U.S. Senate, looks poised to join the 2020 race. At 76, he will be the second oldest candidate in the Democratic nominating contests, after Senator Bernie Sanders. Biden will be a key figure in the Democratic debate over whether a liberal political newcomer or a centrist veteran is needed to win back the White House. Liberal activists criticize his Senate record, including his authorship of the 1994 crime act that led to increased incarceration rates, and his ties to the financial industry, which is prominent in his home state of Delaware. Biden, who relishes his ""Middle-Class Joe"" nickname and touts his working-class roots, made unsuccessful bids for the nomination in 1988 and 2008. Biden, recently the subject of allegations of unwanted physical contact with women, pledged in a video to be ""more mindful"" of respecting ""personal space,"" an attempt to tamp down the controversy.
BERNIE SANDERS
The senator from Vermont lost the Democratic nomination in 2016 to Hillary Clinton but has jumped in for a second try. In the 2020 race, Sanders, 77, will have to fight to stand out in a packed field of liberal progressives touting issues he brought into the Democratic Party mainstream four years ago. His proposals include free tuition at public colleges, a $15 minimum wage and universal healthcare. He benefits from strong name recognition and a robust network of small-dollar donors, helping him to raise $5.9 million during his first day in the contest. Sanders, whose father was a Jewish immigrant from Poland, has shown a more personal side in this campaign, highlighting his struggles while growing up in a working-class family. He also has tried to reach out to black and Hispanic leaders after having trouble winning over minority voters in 2016.
KAMALA HARRIS
The first-term U.S. senator from California would make history as the first black woman to gain the nomination. Harris, 54, the daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India, announced her candidacy on the holiday honoring slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. She has made a quick impact in a Democratic race that will be heavily influenced by women and minority voters. She raised $1.5 million in the first 24 hours of her campaign and drew record ratings on a CNN televised town hall. She supports a middle-class tax credit, Medicare for All healthcare funding reform, the Green New Deal and the legalization of marijuana. Her track record as San Francisco’s district attorney and California’s attorney general has drawn scrutiny in a Democratic Party that has shifted in recent years on criminal justice issues.
BETO O’ROURKE
The former three-term Texas congressman jumped into the race on March 14 - and has been jumping onto store countertops ever since to deliver his optimistic message to voters in early primary states. O'Rourke, 46, gained fame last year for his record fundraising and ability to draw crowds ahead of his unexpectedly narrow loss in the U.S. Senate race against Republican incumbent Ted Cruz. O'Rourke announced a $6.1 million fundraising haul for the first 24 hours of his campaign, besting his Democratic opponents. But with progressive policies and diversity at the forefront of the party's nominating battle, O'Rourke will face a challenge as a wealthy white man who is more moderate on several key issues than many of his competitors.
ELIZABETH WARREN
The 69-year-old senator from Massachusetts is a leader of the party’s liberals and a fierce Wall Street critic who was instrumental in creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. She has focused her presidential campaign on her populist economic message, promising to fight what she calls a rigged economic system that favors the wealthy. She also has proposed eliminating the Electoral College, vowed to break up Amazon, Google and Facebook if elected, and sworn off political fundraising events to collect cash for her bid. Warren apologized earlier this year to the Cherokee Nation for taking a DNA test to prove her claims to Native American ancestry, an assertion that has prompted Trump to mockingly refer to her as “Pocahontas.""
CORY BOOKER
Booker, 49, a black U.S. senator from New Jersey and former mayor of Newark, gained national prominence in the fight over Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination. He has made U.S. race relations and racial disparities a focus of his campaign, noting the impact of discrimination on his family. He embraces progressive positions on Medicare coverage for every American, the Green New Deal and other key issues, and touts his style of positivity over attacks. Booker eats a vegan diet and recently confirmed rumors he is dating actress Rosario Dawson.
AMY KLOBUCHAR
The third-term U.S. senator from Minnesota was the first moderate in the Democratic field vying to challenge Trump. Klobuchar, 58, gained national attention in 2018 when she sparred with Kavanaugh during Senate hearings for his Supreme Court nomination. On the campaign trail, the former prosecutor and corporate attorney supports an alternative to traditional Medicare healthcare funding and is taking a hard stance against rising prescription drug prices. Klobuchar's campaign reported raising more than $1 million in its first 48 hours. Her campaign announcement came amid news reports that staff in her Senate office were asked to do menial tasks, making it difficult to hire high-level campaign strategists.
PETE BUTTIGIEG
The 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is emerging from underdog status as he begins to build momentum with young voters. A Harvard University graduate and Rhodes Scholar at the University of Oxford, he speaks seven languages and served in Afghanistan with the U.S. Navy Reserve. He touts himself as representing a new generation of leadership needed to combat Trump. Buttigieg would be the first openly gay presidential nominee of a major American political party.
JULIAN CASTRO
The secretary of housing and urban development under President Barack Obama would be the first Hispanic to win a major U.S. party's presidential nomination. Castro, 44, whose grandmother was a Mexican immigrant who immigrated to Texas, has used his family’s personal story to criticize Trump's border policies. Castro advocates for a universal pre-kindergarten program, supports Medicare for All and cites his experience to push for affordable housing. He announced his bid in his hometown of San Antonio, where he once served as mayor and a city councilman. His twin brother, Joaquin Castro, is a Democratic congressman from Texas.
KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND
Gillibrand, known as a moderate when she served as a congresswoman from upstate New York, has refashioned herself into a staunch progressive, calling for strict gun laws and supporting the Green New Deal. The senator for New York, who is 52, has led efforts to address sexual assault in the military and on college campuses, and pushed for Congress to improve its own handling of sexual misconduct allegations. On the campaign trail, she has made fiery denunciations of Trump. She released her tax returns for the years 2007 through 2018, offering the most comprehensive look to date at the finances of a 2020 White House candidate, and has called on her rivals to do the same.
JAY INSLEE
The Washington state governor has made fighting climate change the central issue of his campaign. As governor, Inslee, 68, has moved to put a moratorium on capital punishment and fully implement the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, and accompanying expansion of Medicaid health coverage for the poor. He has not settled on a position on Medicare for All but does support the Green New Deal backed by progressives. Inslee spent 15 years in Congress before being elected governor in 2012.
JOHN HICKENLOOPER
The 67-year-old former Colorado governor has positioned himself as a centrist and an experienced officeholder with business experience. He is the only Democratic presidential candidate so far to oppose the Green New Deal plan to tackle climate change, saying it would give the government too much power in investment decisions. During his two terms in office, Colorado’s economy soared and the Western state expanded healthcare, passed a gun control law and legalized marijuana. The former geologist and brewpub owner is among the many candidates who have refused to take corporate money. He previously served as mayor of Denver.
JOHN DELANEY
The former U.S. representative from Maryland became the first Democrat to enter the 2020 race, declaring his candidacy in July 2017. Delaney, 55, plans to focus on advancing only bipartisan bills during the first 100 days of his presidency if elected. He is also pushing for a universal healthcare system, raising the federal minimum wage and passing gun safety legislation.
TULSI GABBARD
The Samoan-American congresswoman from Hawaii and Iraq war veteran is the first Hindu to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives. After working for her father’s anti-gay advocacy group and drafting relevant legislation, she was forced to apologize for her past views on same-sex marriage. Gabbard, 37, has been against U.S. intervention in Syria and slammed Trump for standing by Saudi Arabia after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. She endorsed Sanders during his 2016 presidential campaign.
TIM RYAN
The moderate nine-term congressman from a working-class district in the battleground state of Ohio has touted his appeal to the blue-collar voters who fled to Trump in 2016. He says Trump has turned his back on those voters and failed to live up his promise to revitalize the manufacturing industry. Ryan, 45, pledges to create jobs in new technologies and focus on public education and access to affordable healthcare. He gained national attention when he tried to unseat Nancy Pelosi as the House Democratic leader in 2016, arguing it was time for new leadership. A former college football player, he also has written books on meditation and healthy eating.
ERIC SWALWELL
The third-term congressman from a California district south of San Francisco says tackling student debt and gun violence are among the reasons he jumped into the race. Swalwell, 38, cites his work on the House Intelligence Committee and his founding of Future Forum, a group of more than 25 Democratic lawmakers that visits universities and community colleges to discuss issues important to millennial voters like student loan debt and climate change, among the reasons he would be a qualified White House candidate. In his first House campaign, Swalwell defeated a Democratic incumbent who had been in office since 1973, seven years before Swalwell was born.
ANDREW YANG
The entrepreneur and former tech executive is focusing his campaign on an ambitious universal income plan. Yang, 44, wants to guarantee all American citizens between the ages of 18 and 64 a $1,000 check every month. The son of immigrants from Taiwan, Yang also is pushing for Medicare for All and proposing a new form of capitalism that is “human-centered.” He lives in New York.
MARIANNE WILLIAMSON
The 66-year-old New York Times best-selling author, motivational speaker and Texas native believes her spirituality-focused campaign can heal America. A 1992 interview on Oprah Winfrey’s show propelled her to make a name for herself as a “spiritual guide” for Hollywood and a self-help expert. She is calling for $100 billion in reparations for slavery over 10 years, gun control, education reform and equal rights for lesbian and gay communities. In 2014, she made an unsuccessful bid for a House seat in California as an independent.
WAYNE MESSAM
Messam, 44, defeated a 16-year incumbent in 2015 to become the first black mayor of in the Miami suburb of Miramar. He was re-elected in March. The son of Jamaican immigrants, he played on Florida State University's 1993 national championship team, and then started a construction business with his wife. He has pledged to focus on reducing gun violence, mitigating climate change and reducing student loan debt and the cost of healthcare.

As Americans worry about the potential end of a 10-year expansion, it’s worth studying the Aussies, whose winning streak is about to turn 28.
By
Neil Irwin
SYDNEY — One Saturday in March, in the suburbs north of Sydney, around three dozen people gathered on a lawn outside a smallish two-bedroom apartment.
They were taking part in an idiosyncrasy of the Australian economic system. Here, selling a home tends to be an almost festive gathering, in which potential buyers show up for an auction and neighbors stop by to watch the spectacle — and quietly calibrate how much their own homes might be worth.
On this muggy day, almost all of the assembled crowd turned out to be gawkers; only four people actually raised their bidding paddles at any point. After bidding opened at 750,000 Australian dollars (about $532,000 in the U.S.), the action started slowly. Twice, it seemed to be petering out as the auctioneer, Andrew Robinson, nearly banged his final gavel, only to be extended with one more bid. Finally a young couple whose agent lobbed in a 930,000 Australian dollar ($661,000) offer
won the day.
It reflected a wheezing Australian housing market. Prices have fallen since the country’s banks tightened lending standards in mid-2018
and the Chinese government made it harder for its citizens to buy property abroad. Not too long ago, the number of interested parties might have been double.
“Twelve to 18 months ago, it would have sold for 1.1 million,” said Mr. Robinson, with Belle Property, as he packed up his gavel and papers and prepared to head to his next auction on a day he would conduct eight of them. “There was more of a frenzied atmosphere, more people bidding who just didn’t want to lose out.”
I had flown 16,000 miles not to study economic malaise, but its opposite: the remarkable resilience of the Australian economy, which has gone nearly 28 years without a recession. The government, with elections to take place next month, recently announced an expected surplus in the next budget year.
Surely this grand economic success story would hold lessons for the United States and the rest of the world, right?
Yet instead of giddy enthusiasm, what I found in Sydney was a pervasive sense of caution and wariness — and not just involving real estate, though housing does loom large in discussions about the economy. In conversations with Australian businesspeople and college students, economists and government officials, I detected no sense of triumphalism.
An entire generation of young adults has grown up without experiencing a protracted downturn. But in Australia, as I came to learn, nobody really
acts
as if they’re the stars of an unprecedented three-decade success story. They’re aware that the good times could end. The mood is more practicality than pessimism.
America is on the verge of its own economic milestone: The current expansion is on track to reach its 10th birthday this summer, which would also put it on record as the nation’s longest streak without a recession.
During the decade I’ve spent chronicling that growth as an economics writer, a persistent whisper has been: How long can it go? The run has been uneven, underwhelming and repeatedly on the verge of unraveling, including scary moments in 2010, 2015 and this past December. Seemingly every commentator without a good cliché blocker has
referred
to it as “long in the tooth.”
Even the language of economics suggests that an end to the good times is inevitable. If you’re going to call it the “business cycle,” things can’t just keep getting better forever. Some of history’s great economic thinkers have theorized that downturns are as essential to the workings of the economy as the seasons are to agriculture.
Is Australia a unique case, a beneficiary of some good economic luck that cannot be replicated in the rest of the world? Or is the nation onto something, and are there lessons in economic policy that are applicable everywhere?
When I landed there in mid-March, in the waning days of the Australian summer, that’s what I hoped to figure out.
Ask Australian economists about this golden run, and almost all will say it has been driven partly by good luck and partly by good policy.
The luck part can’t be minimized. Beneath the ground of large stretches of Australia are the iron ore and coal that have been the raw materials behind China’s long economic boom. Above ground lies the wheat and cattle that have helped feed China’s rapidly growing middle-class population.
China’s growth, in other words, has created a tailwind that has boosted Australia’s economy for much of this period. And if the Chinese economy ever truly tanks, even the most skilled policymakers in Australia will have a hard time preventing a recession.
But China’s gravitational pull can explain only so much. For one thing, other countries nearby have had recessions, some severe, in recent decades. And there are a long list of policy choices that enabled the long Australian boom even as otherwise similar economies sank.
One episode is particularly telling. In 1997, an East Asian financial crisis walloped the economies of countries like South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia. These nations were major buyers of Australian exports. The value of the Australian dollar started to fall on global currency markets, putting the expansion at risk only six years in.
On the other side of the Tasman Sea, New Zealand’s central bank responded to the same problem by raising interest rates. After all, a falling New Zealand dollar indicated a lack of confidence in the currency and implied that inflation would soon rise.
At the Reserve Bank of Australia, by contrast, officials concluded that the falling value of the Australian dollar reflected shifting economic fundamentals that were ultimately healthy — part of how the Australian economy could adapt to faltering demand from East Asia.
Rather than raise interest rates to try to prevent a falling currency, they viewed a falling currency as the key to navigating the peril — by making Australian exports more competitive in the United States and Europe, for example.
“The government was uncomfortable if the exchange rate went too low, because it looked like a sign of no confidence,” said Malcolm Edey, who was the central bank’s head of economic research at the time. “We had a good monetary framework in place, we stuck to it, and we didn’t panic when the exchange rate moved around along the way.”
Sure enough, New Zealand fell into recession in 1997 and 1998, while Australia endured only a period of subpar growth. Good policy, it turns out, has a way of creating good luck. And it wasn’t the only time.
If you had looked around the world circa 2006, you would have seen a number of countries where housing prices had soared into potential bubble territory, including the United States, Britain and Australia.
But two years later, while the United States and Britain were in a severe recession and financial crisis, Australia experienced only a single quarter of contraction. Why the difference?
The answer seems to be how the financial industries of those countries were structured and regulated. To understand that better, I sought out a tutor, one who turned out to have an unlikely background: David Morgan, a former child actor and professional Australian Rules Football player who later became one of the country’s leading bankers.
After a wave of deregulation in the 1980s, Australian banks took on ever-more-risky lending, especially for commercial real estate, and got into new business lines overseas in which they had no obvious competitive advantage. When that asset bubble popped and a recession arrived, the banks came near failure, and there was a wholesale firing of top bank executives.
It was a matter of “going through the furnace, and coming out tempered by experience,” said Mr. Morgan, who was chief executive of Westpac, one of Australia’s major banks, during the crisis. “We were adamant that we would go into the next shock with the least risk and the
most resilience,
and would not engage in any more offshore frolics.”
The banks — with prodding from regulators — reformulated themselves to take a more conservative and domestically focused approach to lending. After that near-death experience, there remained the “Big Four” banks that together control about 80 percent of deposits; they are not allowed to merge with each other.
The banks also did not engage in the kind of expansionist strategy that had gotten them in trouble in 1991. They did not open huge offices in Hong Kong, London or New York, nor get in the business of creating the complex mortgage securities that were the nexus of the financial crisis.
Good regulation was part of it. “They were good quality regulators; the public sector was getting good people,” Mr. Morgan said. Both major political parties have tended to be tough on banks, and there is a single powerful regulator rather than a patchwork of them as in the United States.
But just as important was the sense among bank leaders that they would need to be ready when the next downturn came.
It’s not as if Australia’s banks are perfect actors. A
royal commission
established to examine the industry found widespread misconduct, including abuses of customers, in a report issued this year.
But they have focused on lending to Australians, especially for home mortgages, and held those loans on their own books. No doubt Australia has missed out on some opportunities by not hosting the big, complicated banks that operate worldwide and do more sophisticated forms of finance. Sydney does not have the concentration of high-paying finance jobs that London and Hong Kong do.
But having a conservative, domestically focused, highly concentrated banking system meant that Australia wasn’t stuck importing other countries’ financial contagions when crises hit.
During the global financial crisis, Australia suffered from plummeting demand for its products. But a nicely designed fiscal stimulus — combined with a falling Australian dollar and an assist from aggressive stimulus by China — helped the country regain its footing rapidly and avoid the mass economic pain found in so much of the world.
If there’s anyone you would expect to be bullish, it might be the young adults entering the work force, who have never lived through a recession. But among them — as with other Australians who don’t occupy the halls of government or financial power — you find angst and uncertainty rather than boom-time optimism.
“I think there will be a recession within the next 10 years,” said George Ye, 25, who is studying for a master’s degree in data science at the University of Sydney. “I feel like sentiment is, we might have gotten to a peak. Things have gone so well for so long that the things we need to buy are getting more and more expensive,” especially housing. “I think the generation of people born 10 years prior to me are much more confident than I am.”
“I’m pessimistic,” said Freya Zemek, 24, an employee at the university. “I think we’re probably looking at a recession in 2020. Consumer confidence isn’t very high. The signs aren’t looking great, and I think it’s the sort of tightrope situation where we could be next for a recession. It’s only a matter of time. Nothing goes on forever.”
Housing especially seems to be in the opposite of a sweet spot. It’s still too expensive, especially in booming Sydney and Melbourne, for young people. Yet the prices are well below those from a couple of years ago, leaving recent buyers sitting on paper losses.
But just maybe, the contrast between a pessimistic mood and a long record of economic success isn’t as contradictory as it may seem.
In November 1990, the Australian treasurer (and later prime minister) Paul Keating described a painful downturn then underway as “the recession we had to have.”
His point was that excesses in a lending and credit boom, combined with high inflation, meant that the Australian economy needed the wrenching experience of a downturn to rid itself of those excesses. It was also a horrible political gaffe, a comment that went over poorly in a country then burdened with an 11 percent unemployment rate.
But the question of whether he was right is profound — one that economists can still debate.
The great economic thinker Joseph Schumpeter argued that recessions served an essential purging mechanism enabling a society to become richer over time. Through business failures, capital is redeployed to emerging high-growth industries. In this thinking, recessions play a cleansing effect, clearing the way for the future.
Hyman Minsky, another 20th-century economist, argued that long periods of financial stability could breed complacency: The longer a nation goes without a downturn, the more risky behavior will build up in the economy, making the eventual downturn worse.
Those theories sound plausible. Data to support the case is a little harder to find. In fact, there is some evidence that recessions actually cause lasting damage to a country’s economic potential — that they hurt, rather than help — by thrusting people out of the work force unnecessarily and causing their skills to atrophy. Research shows that people who enter the work force during a recession take a hit to their earnings even decades later.
There have also been long periods when the Minskyite story has seemed not to apply, notably in the decades after World War II in the United States.
“I think Australia’s experience shows that you don’t need recessions to clean out the system, but it does show that what you need is strong, clear policy settings from governments,” said James Pearson, the chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. “There is a risk, and I think we’re seeing it in Australia today, that a prolonged period of economic growth without recession can lead to complacency both among policymakers and the electorate.”
But that brings us back to the slowing housing market, and the general sense of pessimism that sneaks into conversations about the economy in Australia, especially among the young.
Maybe the real reason Australia has made it so long without a downturn is an absence of complacency. No one is brimming with overconfidence that all is well and always will be.
“What has happened in the last 27 years is a series of shocks, each of which, thanks to policy and luck, we were able to overcome,” said Stephen Grenville, the former deputy governor of the
Reserve Bank of
Australia and now a fellow at the Lowy Institute. “That’s the nature of the economy we’re in now — an economy with shocks plus flexibility.”
It isn’t the absence of bad stuff happening in the economy that has kept Australia growing for so long. It is the nation’s economic flexibility and policymakers’ rejection of complacency.
So maybe the pessimism isn’t a paradox at all. And maybe we would be more worried about Australia’s economic future if house prices had kept soaring toward unsustainable highs, or if young people had made economic decisions with a sense of reckless invincibility and engaged in borrowing and spending behaviors accordingly.
The Australian experience is evidence that the “business cycle” is a misleading
way to think about economic growth.
Recessions aren’t like thunderstorms, an inevitable, random event that may be violent but provide much-needed water to crops.
Maybe recessions are more like car crashes. They may never be completely eliminated, but making the right choices can make them rarer and less damaging when they do happen.
In trying to learn the lessons of Australia, that may be the biggest of them all. There will always be bad things that happen in an economy. The best way to keep them from causing the mass pain that accompanies a recession is to combine sound policy, a flexible and dynamic economy and — perhaps most important — just the right amount of fear.

New York’s newest neighborhood drew inspiration from Battery Park City, but is filled with 21st-century twists.

Land where there was none before. A careful ratio of places to live, work, eat and recline on lawns. A sense of being in New York, but not quite of it.
At first blush, Hudson Yards and Battery Park City, cities-within-a-city on the western edge of Manhattan, would seem kindred spirits.
But Hudson Yards, which is to wrap up by 2026, will have taken 18 years to complete its gleaming clump along 10th Avenue — and it remains to be seen how quickly the rest of the neighborhood will develop. Battery Park City, which lumbered across the finish line in 2011, took 45 years to fully form.
Battery Park City stretches across more space along the Hudson River in the financial district, but a similar number of buildings make up the two master-planned, mixed-use communities, which have both also enjoyed tax breaks and other public benefits.
Why
Hudson Yards
was able to come together quickly, relatively speaking, has a lot do with how the approach to creating whole-cloth neighborhoods has changed over the years, as the private sector has stepped in to fill voids left by the government, according to city officials, brokers and developers.
But also, vibes have changed. What was architecturally appealing a few decades ago now seems staid. Planners say that if the past was about fitting in, the present is all about standing out. In the end, they add, Battery Park City and Hudson Yards represent very different theories about development.
“Hudson Yards represents the 21st century, and Battery Park City represents the end of the 20th century,” said Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University. “They are just totally different.”
Both Hudson Yards and Battery Park City hatched from efforts to remake once-industrial areas that were not living up to their potential.
Dirt unearthed during the construction of the first World Trade Center in the mid-1960s, plus sandier fill, allowed Battery Park City to essentially be sewn onto the edge of Manhattan, creating a bumped-out shoreline where rotting piers for fruit and vegetable shipments had stood before.
But to make the 92-acre swath more than just a park required a huge investment: in sea walls, water pipes and electrical lines. And constructing that infrastructure fell to the state, which had to borrow a lot of money to make it happen. In 1972, the
Hugh L. Carey Battery Park City Authority
, the neighborhood’s quasi-public governing body, had to sell $200 million in state-guaranteed bonds — considering inflation, about $1.2 billion in 2019 dollars — to set the table for development.
But by 1979, there was still almost nothing to show for it. (The barren and beachy terrain drew sunbathers for years.)
With payments on those bonds coming due, and little in revenue to pay its debt, the Authority had to sell even more bonds, $65 million worth, to avoid default. Doubling down on their bet, officials were buying time until rent-producing structures went up. It wasn’t until 1982 that the first building, the Gateway apartment complex, with 1,712 units, opened.
Hoping to avoid another dragged-out process, the city took a different tack with Hudson Yards, a 28-acre parcel being developed by the Related Companies and Oxford Properties Group at the heart of the neighborhood of the same name, where other projects are also underway.
Most of the Hudson Yards site is ribbed with railroad tracks, by way of the John D. Caemmerer West Side Storage Yard, where Long Island Rail Road trains rest before heading back to Nassau County.
To create the development site, the tracks had to be covered. But the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which controls the property, wisely avoided building that platform itself, said Tom Wright, the president and chief executive of the Regional Plan Association, an urban research group.
By punting to Related and Oxford, which paid $1 billion for the rights to the site and built the deck, the M.T.A. made sure taxpayers wouldn’t be on the hook, said Mr. Wright, whose group supports the project.
“Battery Park City required the public to take on a lot more risk,” he said. But with the Hudson Yards model, “whether Related goes belly up, or not, is not our problem.”
As a private entity, Related, the lead developer, was also able to work relatively quickly and avoid being subjected to shifts in public opinion. If the M.T.A. had been responsible for building the platform, for example, a subway crisis might easily have diverted its attention and stalled the project.
A bit of forethought also worked in the project’s favor. In the 1980s, when the Transportation Authority was undertaking a $196 million project to
turn a defunct freight depot into the 30-track Hudson Yards rail yard
, Richard Ravitch, who was then the chairman, realized the air above the new yard had great potential.
So he added enough space between the tracks to allow columns to stand between them, while also fortifying the ground to support huge weights. The groundwork for Hudson Yards was laid.
In 2008, the state received six proposals to develop the site and initially awarded development rights to Tishman Speyer, which controls Rockefeller Center. But as the Great Recession gathered steam, Tishman,
which lost a key anchor tenant, Morgan Stanley
, soon backed out, and Related took over.
Having fewer people calling the shots may also have helped. Battery Park City was constructed by a parade of companies, including
Milstein Properties
, LeFrak Organization and Zeckendorf, plus commercial builders.
But Hudson Yards is the result of a single company, which is a huge advantage, said Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor under Michael Bloomberg who pushed hard for the rezoning that created Hudson Yards as part of the city’s unsuccessful bid for the 2012 Olympics.
“What’s very different is that one developer built the commercial and residential and retail space,” said Mr. Doctoroff, who has firsthand knowledge of both places. Early in his career, he worked at 200 Vesey Street in Battery Park City for Lehman Brothers, the investment bank that was one of the neighborhood’s first office tenants. He is now chief executive of Sidewalk Labs, a city-focused technology company headquartered at 10 Hudson Yards, the area’s first commercial tower.
As part of the Olympics proposal, a football stadium that would have become the home of the New York Jets would have been built on the western half of the train yards, but state officials spiked the plan in 2005 in the face of community opposition.
Mr. Doctoroff said he is still proud that the rezoning of the broader Hudson Yards neighborhood has allowed warehouses, parking lots and billboards to give way to stylish modern towers.
While Battery Park City may embody the lessons of the urbanist Jane Jacobs, who favored short blocks, Hudson Yards can feel derived from her opposite, master builder Robert Moses, whose approach was often big and muscular.
The fits-and-starts history of Battery Park City is also evident in its varied designs.
Plans for Battery Park City went through multiple iterations. It started with a 1966 “towers in the park” plan for apartment buildings to house World Trade Center employees that Ada Louise Huxtable, the architecture critic for The New York Times, called “sterile high-rise towers in vacuous open space.” The plan estimated about 90,000 residents, a far cry from the 16,000 there today.
By 1969, the Authority had scrapped that plan in favor of a more architecturally ambitious one, from Philip Johnson and other architects, that featured a mix of six-sided towers and smaller buildings with walls that sloped like pyramids. A third version in the 1970s added more offices, but was revised again in 1979 because corporations had started migrating to the suburbs to escape a crime-troubled metropolis.
“I think the original designers were people that didn’t like the city very much, because they kept giving a cleaned-up view of what the city could be,” said Stan Eckstut, the architect who, along with Alexander Cooper, was tapped for that fourth version.
Aiming for a traditional extension of Manhattan, Mr. Eckstut aligned streets with existing ones in the financial district, while creating small blocks, in a Jacobs-type gesture.
Today, Battery Park City is probably best known for its brick-and-stone buildings, many from the 1980s, after developers finally came around, although there are exceptions, like the parabolic Visionaire, a condo high-rise built in 2008. The
last two apartment buildings to go up
, in 2011, were the rentals Liberty Luxe and Liberty Green.
Many blocks have an unvarying appearance, the urban equivalent of a subdivision, and critics have pounced on that conformity.
Rent-regulated housing is a modest percentage of the total. But a portion of payments collected by the Authority — residents don’t pay property taxes, but fees that are similar — goes to New York City to be spent on affordable housing development elsewhere in the city, though it has been
tapped for other purposes
. Last year, the city took in $197 million, according to the Authority.
People who work in Battery Park City are clustered in
Brookfield Place
, a warren of interconnected office buildings interspersed with shops formerly known as the World Financial Center, whose enclosed, climate-controlled walkways evoke, in a sense, Johnson’s vision. Also inside is the Winter Garden, an airy, skylighted space with 16 palm trees that holds events like Best Brews, a New York-focused craft-beer tasting.
In 2015, after a four-year, $300 million effort, landlord Brookfield Properties revealed a renovation of the retail spaces, including Le District, a 30,000-square-foot French-style market and Hudson Eats, a food hall dedicated to New York-only restaurants.
Brookfield also installed high-end shops, but the mall’s anchor tenant, a multilevel Saks Fifth Avenue department store, closed this winter after less than two years. Competition for upscale shoppers is stiff because Westfield, a sprawling mall in the nearby Oculus transportation hub, is a quick walk away.
Outdoor green spaces include Teardrop Park, whose rocky walls recall the Catskills, and Rockefeller Park, whose wide-open lawns offer Hudson views.
“The sentiment seems the same between us and Hudson Yards. It’s ‘I want to be in a Manhattan that doesn’t feel like Manhattan,’” said Wesley Stanton, a salesman with Douglas Elliman Real Estate.
“But from a sales perspective, it’s very different,” Mr. Stanton said. While apartments at 15 Hudson Yards, a condo that opened this winter, average $3,300 a square foot, he noted, prices in Battery Park City are lower, as at the Ritz-Carlton condo, where units average $2,300 a square foot.
The blocks at Hudson Yards, by contrast, don’t feel as plugged into the street grid. The view ahead when walking west on West 31st Street, which ends at the development, is of the site’s soaring seven-story mall and the tall logo of its most prominent tenant, Neiman Marcus.
Streets like West 33rd will eventually bisect the site, and there are other ways in. But the site poses an inconvenient hindrance, in the form of that platform, which in places is the equivalent of three stories in the air, Mr. Doctoroff said. If parts of the site feel like a Moses-style superblock akin to Lincoln Center, that’s likely the explanation, he added.
Since 2012, when Related broke ground, buildings have been slow to arrive. But
last month
, much of the first phase, between 10th and 11th Avenues and West 30th and West 32nd Streets, opened to the public. The second phase stretches west to the West Side Highway, and the platform over that portion of the rail yards has yet to be built.
Inside the mall, upscale shops like Cartier, Rolex and Molton Brown line conventional-looking corridors. Dining options seem light years ahead of the food courts of old, including Thomas Keller’s TAK Room, David Chang’s Kawi and the Drug Store, a “nonalcoholic bar.” There is also a compact outpost of Citarella, the gourmet grocery chain, while Battery Park City leans on a pair of Gristedes.
Trees and greenery, for now, are limited. But public spaces that recently opened include Vessel, a shiny sculpture that encourages climbing, and the Shed, an all-purpose and telescoping arts center.
There was hardly free rein at the site, said Marianne Kwok, a director of the architecture firm KPF, which has worked from the get-go on the platform, site plan and buildings. Designers had to sift through “two telephone-book-size books of rules and regulations,” said Ms. Kwok, who analyzed Battery Park City, among other neighborhoods, for inspiration.
Unlike in Battery Park City, each Hudson Yards building had to have a singular appearance; some towers angle and others curve. Every corporate tenant “wants to have brand,” Ms. Kwok said. Indeed, Hudson Yards is also a far cry from the homogeneous Rockefeller Center, the 1930s complex considered a master-planning pinnacle. “Individuality is now what’s desired,” she said.
It may be working. A hefty 82 percent of the office spaces in the eastern half of the site, which is mostly commercial buildings, has been spoken for, even though some of the buildings are not yet open, according to Related.
Tackling mostly offices first was an important decision, Mr. Moss said. “The game plan is genius,” he said, adding that an office tower can be filled with a handful of tenants, unlike an apartment building, which needs hundreds of them and can take much longer to fill.

By The New York Times
Now Related has a nice critical mass to publicize the residential buildings on the unbuilt western half, he said, dismissing criticisms that the affluent enclave is not for everyday New Yorkers: “They took a rail yard and made it a productive part of the city’s economy.”
Overall, Related will have to build 1,300 units of housing that are affordable, or reserved for those in certain income brackets. Those units can be built on site or elsewhere.
Less public money has flowed to Hudson Yards, the development, than to Battery Park City, but the amount spent in the neighborhood has not been insignificant. The city has had to pay $359 million in interest on bonds for infrastructure projects, although property taxes are supposed to start covering that debt now that buildings are open.
Assessing the success of the condos is tougher. The first building, 15 Hudson Yards, went on the market two and a half years ago, and is only 60 percent sold. And
35 Hudson Yards
began selling its units, which start at $5 million, in March.
Battery Park City has a ferry stop, but no subway service. But at Hudson Yards, a four-year-old 7 train stop is on site. Brokers remain confident that the subway service will be key to the project’s success, even as critics have called the $2.4 billion transit project, which sits near several Related buildings, a
pricey subsidy
.
Criticism of change doesn’t surprise Roger Del Valle, a prop stylist who has lived in Manhattan since 1995 and owns a studio in the Flatiron district, but is hunting for a home in Hudson Yards.
“I know people have mixed feelings about Hudson Yards,” said Mr. Del Valle, who has visited the mall and enjoys its “spark.” “But it’s a part of New York City now. And ignoring it is not going to make it go away.”

At 80, the legendary playwright reflects on his forward-looking art.
At 80, the legendary playwright reflects on his forward-looking art.
By Philip Galanes
Portrait by Todd Hido
Scene Photographs by Bon Duke
APRIL 10, 2019
At first glance, the early life and career of
Terrence McNally
seems suspiciously charmed: Just a year after graduating from Columbia University in 1960,
1
he was hired by
John Steinbeck
and his wife as a tutor for their two teenage sons on a yearlong family trip around the world.
2
By then, McNally was already in a relationship with his first lover, the playwright
Edward Albee
, who was a decade older.
3
Even a warning about McNally’s heavy drinking, in 1980, was starry: The actress
Angela Lansbury
admonished him that he would never reach his potential as a writer if he continued drinking — at a birthday party for
Stephen Sondheim
, no less.
From his Broadway debut as a playwright in 1965,
4
at the age of 26, McNally wrote comic plays prolifically and mostly successfully for over two decades. Then something shifted: Nearing 50, newly sober and single, he found a new voice — more probing and dramatic, less dependent on wit — with “Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune,”
5
which opened off Broadway in 1987, starring Kathy Bates and F. Murray Abraham. Like much of McNally’s best work, “Frankie and Johnny” explores the longing for human connection and the fears that stand in its way. A new revival, starring
Audra McDonald
and
Michael Shannon
, will debut on Broadway in May.
McNally followed “Frankie and Johnny” with several well-regarded plays, often focusing on gay men and reflecting his own love of opera, notably “Love! Valour! Compassion!” (1994)
6
and “Master Class” (1995),
7
both of which won him Tony Awards. In parallel, he wrote librettos for several Broadway musicals, including “Kiss of the Spider Woman” (1993), based on the novel by
Manuel Puig
, and “Ragtime” (1998), adapted from the 1975 novel by
E.L. Doctorow
, earning him two more Tonys.
What distinguishes all of McNally’s later plays, however, is his canny mix of terror and humor. He probes his characters’ deepest fears — of illness, intimacy, betrayal or death — while making them manageable for all audiences, leavening the dread with his rat-a-tat dialogue and well-timed jokes.
8
You can call it fainthearted, but there is generosity and wisdom in his calculus: For decades, McNally has brought both the darkness and light of the human condition to theatergoers who might have avoided the pure despair of his closest predecessors,
Eugene O’Neill
or
Arthur Miller
. Like them, though, McNally’s scripts rely on a kind of classic formalism (larger-than-life characters, well-defined conflicts, clear narrative arcs) that has influenced the current era of television — you need only look at “Succession” or “Mad Men” for echoes of McNally’s work: his skill at elevating the tension in stories to nearly unbearable levels before releasing that pressure, suddenly, with unexpected tonal shifts.
McNally’s other great legacy might be bringing gayness to a broad theater audience, and in doing so, humanizing and universalizing the specific concerns and sorrows, including AIDS, of the community. He all but coined the expression “love is love” — the third act of “Love! Valour! Compassion!” alone, in which an improbable romance blooms between a character with H.I.V. and another dying of complications from AIDS, would likely draw tears from even the most virulent homophobe. Still, his gift for transforming inherent tragedy into an entertaining evening may have cost him in terms of his critical reputation: McNally is rarely considered to be at the cutting-edge of contemporary playwrights, even though he
was
among the first to place such marginalized characters at center stage and, too, one of a small group of men at the time who wrote persuasively about the interior lives of women.
9
In that way, his work stands for itself — and being produced and nearly endlessly revived for more than 50 years is inarguably its own kind of acclaim.
Now 80 — and the author of more than three dozen plays, 14 librettos for musical theater and opera as well as several adaptations of his work for film and television — McNally is still writing. We met in March at his Greenwich Village apartment, where he lives with his husband, the theater producer
Tom Kirdahy
, for a discussion of his life, his career and his argument for becoming a playwright in the age of prestige television.

PHILIP GALANES: In an essay about your childhood,
10
you wrote: “I had a very strong desire to make myself heard.” Do you know who writes that? Someone who hasn’t been heard.
TERRENCE McNALLY:
Maybe the better word is
mattered
. I wanted to write things that mattered. I wanted to matter. I felt so unnoticed growing up.
11
I remember my father going to work, early in the morning, and the dining room table would be covered with mock copy for El Tejano, the school newspaper, which I wrote a lot of and copy-edited. I measured the columns and made them fit. But he didn’t seem impressed that I’d been up all night.
PG: Tell me about your family dynamic.
TM:
Now that I’m older, I think I somewhat terrified my parents. They left me alone. They weren’t unfeeling, more like:
We don’t know what he’s doing in his room — writing all the time or listening to Broadway shows and operas.
12
We have a weird child.
They didn’t get me. And they didn’t particularly want to get me.
PG: I think part of my parents’ remoteness was their dawning sense that I was gay.
TM:
We never discussed it, but that was probably true of mine, too. My parents’ marriage was not without strain. I come from a family of heavy drinkers, so that was an aspect of growing up. But I mainly felt left alone, not blockaded. They were the original “don’t ask, don’t tell.”
They could be quite charming, too. One year, [the Italian conductor Arturo]
Toscanini
was conducting “Aida,” and the best radio in the house was with the TV. Remember consoles — a TV and record player in a beautiful cabinet? So my parents sat in the car, listening to the football game, and let me be in the house, listening. I think that’s more love than saying “I love you.” I remember them out there in their coats; it can get cold in South Texas in the winter.
PG: Were you always planning to become a playwright as opposed to, say, a novelist?
TM:
I realized very early that my descriptive powers — what a room looked like, what a person looked like — were scant. But I could write credible dialogue. And my characters sounded different from one another. I could define them better by how they spoke than by telling you how they looked. And after college, when I went to Mexico and wrote half of
my
Great American Novel, I decided if I really wanted to be a writer, I’d better focus on theater.
PG: Well, you’ve definitely been heard as a playwright. Does that desire to matter ever go away?
TM:
No, I don’t think it does.
PG: I reread some of your early plays, and as your work matures, it becomes harder to know what
you
make of your characters and their situations. The man who wants to be heard is gone. Was that intentional?
TM:
You’re right. I noticed it, too, in hindsight. It was not deliberate. The first play I wrote after I got sober was “Frankie and Johnny.” It was the first play where I’m not writing my opinion of everybody. My early work
13
is more satirical, so you know who’s bad; you know my politics. You know what I approve of and what I don’t.
So, there was sobriety. I remember how terrified I was, writing “Frankie and Johnny,” being sober for the first time. I just drank too much, alcoholic or not. I was drunk every day. And maybe there was maturity, too? But there was certainly a change in my work. It’s hard to know who you are if you’re drunk all the time. It clouds your thinking. I started thinking more about my people — my characters.
PG:
Who were your strongest mentors and influences?
TM:
I’m always reading and rereading
Chekhov
and Shakespeare. They’re my constant sources of inspiration. They’re not on the page, either. I don’t know what Shakespeare thinks of his characters. And Chekhov plays are totally mysterious. What are they
really
about?
PG:
Was Edward Albee, your lover in the late ’50s and early ’60s, helpful to you?
TM:
No, Edward was very supportive of the next generation of writers, but he found it difficult to be as generous with me.
PG:
Because he was competitive?
TM:
Well, it seems absurd that the author of “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” would be competitive with someone trying to write his first play. But I don’t want to sound like I’m complaining. Edward had his limitations. We all do.
PG:
That yearning to connect at the heart of “Frankie and Johnny” had appeared in your work before, but never so urgently. The idea of a one-night stand who won’t go away, who wants to marry you in the morning — it’s very extreme!
TM:
It’s a poetic play, poetic and very personal. Most of the plays I’ve written, I think: “No one’s going to want to do this, but I want to tell the story anyway.” I was living in Chelsea, and I saw all these attractive men and women at Blockbuster Video with stacks of tapes. They were clearly going to spend the weekend watching movies at home rather than going out to bars or clubs. And I thought, “How sad! They’ve given up.”
I was nearly 50, and I wasn’t in a relationship. I thought, “Maybe it’s all over?” But then I changed my mind. I thought, “I don’t want to imagine a world where being 50 and not looking like a Greek Adonis or Marilyn Monroe means your life is over.” And of course, most of us don’t look like Adonis or Marilyn Monroe, so it turned out there was a huge audience for the play. We dismiss people so quickly:
She’s not the one
. My favorite line is when Johnny says, “Everything I want is in this room.” I believe that.
PG:
It’s a remarkably prescient play, with Blockbuster Video morphing into social media and our obsession with cellphones, where
nothing
we want is in this room.
TM:
At 80, I’ve certainly lived. And I can say I’ve seen some big changes in my lifetime. But that phenomenon of six people at a restaurant all on their phones! Why did you bother to say, “Let’s have dinner together”? But it just makes you sound like an old grump. And I’m not.
PG:
No, you were a pioneer, one of the first playwrights to explore gay characters in your work — from the very beginning, in the 1960s. Did you see that as bravery?
TM:
Not at all. I saw it as: These are people. I wasn’t writing these plays in Texas. I was writing them in New York, which is sophisticated. I always felt it was O.K. to be gay in the American theater. And I never understood my friends who stayed closeted.
PG:
Maybe coming out required a special temperament when you did, in the late ’50s?
TM:
It required the temperament to say, “This is who I am. I want to be Terrence McNally.” There’s a line in “Master Class” where one of the students says, “You just want us to sing like you.” And Callas responds, “Only Cecilia Sophia” — and she gives all five of her names — “Kalogeropoulou could sing like Maria Callas.” You had to have had her life to sing like her: the unloving mother, the suffering during the war, the betrayal and struggles.
And my life has made me who I am. So, I didn’t think of writing as a gay man as brave. I respected the playwrights and artists who chose to remain closeted, but it angered me. I thought it was morally wrong not to stand up and say, “Hey, I’m one of them.”
PG:
There’s a leitmotif running through your work, starting with “The Lisbon Traviata,”
14
about gay men submerging their deepest emotional lives in Broadway musicals and opera divas.
TM:
When I came along, gay men were often represented as witty and a little sad. And it’s easier to hide out in the world of
Bette Midler
or
Judy Garland
, now
Lady Gaga
, than really deal with our own lives. But I thought, “Gay men are
filled
with emotion.” In “The Lisbon Traviata,” I wanted to write a play about a gay man whose passions make him capable of murder — not that I approve of murder.
People think gay — no, people
thought
, I do see change — that gay men and women were somehow “people lite” because we didn’t have the responsibility of families or children. The idea that a gay person can’t have the authentic emotions of a heterosexual — that drove me insane! So, gay anger, loss, grief and rage run through a lot of my plays.
PG:
What do you think of the labels “gay writer” or “gay play,” now that the nation is circling back to identity politics?
TM:
No one has asked me that question in years, thank God! I’m a playwright. I think the era when we need to categorize people is over. I went from always being “the gay playwright Terrence McNally” to just being Terrence McNally. I’m glad to have been alive to see that happen. It was always honorable to be a gay man and a gay writer. But I think categorizing people that way marginalizes them.

PG:
When the AIDS crisis exploded, there were some very moving “issue” plays, like “The Normal Heart” (1985) by
Larry Kramer
, about gay men dying. But you were ingenious with “Lips Together, Teeth Apart,” flipping the script and writing about AIDS from the vantage of two straight couples, after the gay man, a brother of one of the women, has died.
TM:
Gay people, like people in all minority communities, are often being observed by the majority. So, I imagined these four straight people, surrounded by all these houses, suddenly in the minority on Fire Island on this big Fourth of July weekend. They’re the ones being judged. It seemed like the right idea.
PG:
Was it hard not to judge those characters — refusing to get into the swimming pool, for instance, for fear of catching AIDS?
TM:
I didn’t need to judge them. Just showing their actions conveyed the foolishness of it, their hysteria. That moment was actually based on a good friend of mine. She said, “Can I have another water glass?” And I replied, “What’s wrong with it?” She said, “I think you took a sip out of my glass.” It was unspoken. And this was a sophisticated woman. Suddenly, my dentist had gloves and masks. It didn’t need to be spoken.
Most people think playwriting is writing dialogue. But, actually, it’s observing action. I don’t puzzle out plays:
What should I write about next?
An idea comes. And in “Lips Together,” I knew I was writing for those four actors.
15
I love that! If someone said to me, “Could you write a play in the next two weeks?” and gave me four actors I like and can write for, I could do it. I like imagining the voices. In my early plays, I used to write for
Laurence Olivier
and Ethel Merman. I could hear Ethel saying my lines.
PG: It’s an interesting element of your career, the way you’ve established a company of actors:
Nathan Lane
,
16
Anthony Heald.
17
Later, Zoe Caldwell
18
and
Audra McDonald
.
19
TM:
Working with a company of actors who get it, who get
you
, is incredible. You don’t have to explain. If you have to explain to an actor why a line is funny or poignant, they’re wrong for you. Those actors you mentioned, I’ve never once said, “You know that one line? If you just hit that word harder … ” But those same actors, they’re all stars. They’re too big to be contained. So, they fly away and are often unavailable.
PG:
That must hurt. You made some of their careers.
TM:
I used to take it very hard. But at 80, I’m better about it.
Oh, a chance to play Hamlet at London’s National Theater?
I get it. But that generosity took a while.
PG: I gather you’re not an adherent of the
Alfred Hitchcock
school: Treat actors like cattle?
20
TM:
The hardest part of the job is, and always will be, to get the right actors and the right director in a room together with the right script. That’s the inviolate law of good theater. You want to surround yourself with the best. Especially for a play that’s having its world premiere. You’re making a footprint of it with the actors and designers. And I’ve been very lucky. It’s a wonderful challenge to write for actors like Nathan Lane or Zoe Caldwell. I’ve always said that Shakespeare must have had great actors at the Globe. You don’t write parts like King Lear or Cleopatra unless you have actors who can handle them.
PG: How much are you still discovering plays when you take them into rehearsal with the actors and director? I’m thinking of a sprawling play like “Love! Valour! Compassion!” with eight big characters romping through a crowded summer house.
TM:
That was a play I struggled with. A lot happened to it in rehearsal. But I ended up being very proud of it. I wanted to show what else gay men were doing besides having AIDS and dying. There was life! We were going on nice weekends to the country. I thought of it as writing a gay “Our Town.”
21
Some plays are fun to write. I loved writing “Master Class.” It’s pretty much the first draft we took to this remote town in Montana.
22
They offered to do a reading of my new play, and I talked Zoe Caldwell into it. I said, “Let’s try it out. Because if it’s only of interest to people who care about opera and Maria Callas, no one will produce it.” They loved it, and Zoe was magnificent. And other plays I’ve worked on so hard I can’t believe it, they’ve been completely rejected.
PG: Let’s talk about “Master Class.” In Callas’s final speech, we may get as close to you as we do in any play: “The older I get, the less I know, but I am certain that what we do matters. If I didn’t believe that … ” and then she can’t finish the sentence.
TM:
Because it’s incomprehensible to her. If art doesn’t matter, then she has lived her life in vain and suffered in vain. It’s a moment that means so much to me.
PG:
We hear an echo of it in the short play “Muses of Fire,” which you wrote for this magazine — with all these famous American playwrights kibitzing in heaven on Inauguration Day after the 2024 election. Bad things may happen, but preventing them was never the point of playwriting.
TM:
No, it’s about having those pure feelings again, reminding the world that we’re not alone. There is finally a generosity among artists, especially when we get older. When we’re young, New York is a big city with a lot of competition. Everyone wants to be
Maria Callas
or
Leonard Bernstein
or Nathan Lane. You’ve got to fight. And the people I know who’ve succeeded in this business are killers — including me, or I wouldn’t have kept it up this long. But being a killer is having the fierce need to matter, to be heard. You don’t have to agree with me, but I want to grab you by the lapel and shake you: “At least you’ve heard what I have to say.”
PG:
Take me through how your best-known musical, “Ragtime,”
23
came together.
TM:
The producer Garth Drabinsky called and said, “I just acquired the rights to ‘Ragtime,’ as a musical. Are you interested?” I reread it that night. It’s one of my favorite books. And I called him back in the morning: “Absolutely!” But what I wanted to do was to write a synopsis and show it to [the author] E.L. Doctorow. If he didn’t like my concept, I didn’t want to do it. I never saw the film of “Ragtime” (1981), but he was on every TV show saying they’d ruined his book. I didn’t want that to be me. But he approved my treatment.
So, then we asked different people to submit ideas for five or six songs, based on my outline. It was all anonymous — on cassette tape. And Drabinsky, Doctorow and I all agreed on Tape 7, which turned out to be by
Lynn Ahrens
and Stephen Flaherty.
24
PG:
I’ve never heard of a process like that.
TM:
It was my idea. I mean, I auditioned; the actors audition. Why shouldn’t the composer and lyricist?
PG:
Well, it worked: The production was nominated for 13 Tony Awards. Has the show aged well?
TM:
It hits about every mark in the world of politics today: immigration, refugees, violence against African-Americans. They just did a very successful production at Pasadena Playhouse. People said to me, “You’ve updated it.” Not a word! It’s like the last time I saw “Corpus Christi” (1998),
25
people said to me, “I love the way you updated it to include gay marriage.” But my gay Jesus married two guys 20 years ago. It’s nice when things catch up.

Okay, let’s do it.
PG: How about when things don’t need to catch up — when you’re writing in the middle of calamity and crisis, like with H.I.V., for instance, or even the current administration? Does the artist have a special responsibility then?
TM:
Well, I’m working in an age of calamity, but also in an age of great progressive things happening, too, which I consider joyful. So, there’s both, and I think what’s required is an openness to them. One of the reasons I choose to live in New York City — and have since I was 17 — is that you go out onto the street and there are so many different kinds of people, and every one of them has a story. These are tumultuous, rich times for a writer. All you need is ears and a heart.
It’s all in a speech in “A Perfect Ganesh.”
26
When the character arrives at the airport in Bombay, she prays to open her heart to India, which is so different from the cloistered life she’s lived among affluent white people in Connecticut:
Let me experience fully these people who are so different from me. Let me be part of this fabric. Not disappear into it, not become them, but be with them.
My advice to artists is the same as I’d give to someone who wanted to be a better dentist or a better lawyer. Show up, listen, let your heart expand.
PG:
I want to end by asking you about something Steinbeck said to you when you were a young man: “Don’t become a playwright. It’ll break your heart.”
TM:
I remember it vividly. I think he meant failing in the theater is a very public humiliation. When a show of mine is not going well, and I’m sitting in the audience, I don’t need a critic to tell me. I can feel it.
PG:
So, did playwriting break your heart?
TM:
Plenty of times! But it’s filled my heart, too. And I picked myself up and started all over again several times, which is all you can do in life.
PG:
Are you still writing?
TM:
I am.
27
PG:
And still going to the theater eight nights a week?
TM:
Yes, but I’m napping beforehand now. That’s a new phenomenon. I’m living with cancer, which is challenging. The medications often make me tired. But it’s been 20 years since my diagnosis, so I can’t say I didn’t get value.
PG:
That’s a big change. The theater has changed a lot, too.
TM:
The world wants blockbusters now: “Hamilton”s, infinite runs. The theater where “The Phantom of the Opera” plays has been unavailable for about 30 years. Hit shows used to run for two seasons. Ticket prices are much higher. But you know what the biggest change is? I ask people who take tickets in the theater what they get asked the most: “How long is it?” And if they answer: “One act, 90 minutes,” people are happy. Attention spans have gotten shorter since I was writing three-act plays with two intermissions.
PG: Has the work of being a playwright changed, too?
TM:
The biggest change I feel in the nearly 60 years I’ve been doing this is that it’s a much longer time from the day you write “The End” on your first draft to the curtain falling on its opening night. It was never literally true, but in the ’60s, it felt like you finished your play on Friday and went into rehearsal on Monday. Now, it feels like you finish your first draft in 2010; you get a reading in 2011; you revise the play and get another reading in 2012. It takes years to get a play on, as opposed to months. And it’s harder to hold onto your vision of what you wanted to write about in the first place.
When I first came to New York, plays went out of town and they were developed in front of paying audiences. Now the workshop is the preferred method for developing a show, and I find them tricky because you’re performing it for friends, nervous producers, everybody wanting to make sure it’s a hit. But nothing teaches you more about your play than an audience who has no financial or emotional interest in it: They squirm in their seats; they don’t come back after intermission. Plays are treated like hothouse flowers now. And the theater is more rough-and-tumble than that.
PG: So, is there still an argument for becoming a playwright in the age of Netflix?
TM:
I believe that people’s nervous systems are more open to emotion in the theater with their fellow human beings. When a play is going well, the audience breathes as one. They stop breathing. They breathe together because they’re getting this from other live people. And that doesn’t happen watching Netflix. You talk during it. The phone rings. People are in the theater for one reason: to hear this story and meet the people in it. That’s a human need. If you want to change minds, write a great editorial for the Op-Ed page. But if you want to get people to
feel
differently, reach them through the theater.
