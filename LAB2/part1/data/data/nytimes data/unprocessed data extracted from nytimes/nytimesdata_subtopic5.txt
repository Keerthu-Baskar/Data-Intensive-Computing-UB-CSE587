SYDNEY — Australia's players' union has joined Melbourne Victory boss Kevin Muscat in denouncing the ""dangerous"" Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) pitch after a player suffered a knee injury during an A-League match against Sydney FC on Saturday night.
Midfielder Terry Antonis fell to the ground untouched on the edge of the cricket square during a 2-1 loss for his side in a clash between the last two Australian champions.
The iconic ground is being used for football codes while the neighbouring Sydney Football Stadium is re-vamped and has already attracted criticism after it was torn up during a rugby match.
""It was dangerous, first and foremost,"" Muscat told reporters.
""To ask players to come and work under those conditions is unacceptable. It might be a serious injury as a result from it. And for players to go out onto that, whatever it's called, is a disgrace.""
Professional Footballers Australia (PFA) called for an independent investigation into how the match was allowed to go ahead given the ""deplorable state"" of the pitch, which the body said posed a ""clear danger"" to ""player safety"".
""The players confirmed with us last night that they were not consulted at any stage on whether or not the match should proceed, notwithstanding the clear issues that the pitch presented to their livelihoods,"" chief executive John Didulica said in a statement.
""The PFA will ... recommend two clear resolutions for adoption. Firstly, that FFA immediately commission an independent investigation into the process undertaken to approve last night's match as being fit for play.
""Secondly, endorse a motion that players will no longer play on surfaces unacceptably compromised by a cricket wicket.""
Sydney FC, whose victory kept them second in the A-League, are scheduled to host league leaders Perth Glory at the ground on April 18.
""The pitch clearly wasn't up to the standards required for professional football and we are working with the SCG Trust and FFA to assess its suitability to host our game against Perth in 11 days' time,"" said Sydney FC chief executive Danny Townsend.
""All options are on the table, including moving the game, and those discussions are already underway.""
Some 3,000 square metres of turf at the ground were replaced last month after huge divots came up during a rugby union match between the New South Wales Waratahs and Queensland Reds.
The Sydney Roosters rugby league team have also used the ground and the various codes have varied the layout of the pitch in order to mitigate the impact of the three different types of grass on the surface.
The SCG has hosted test cricket since 1882 and was the venue for hundreds of rugby league and union matches before the SFS was completed in 1988. It has also been the home of the Sydney Swans Australian Rules team since 1982.
Didulica said the presence of a cricket wicket on a playing surface presented ""an unreasonable danger to the health and safety of footballers"".
""It remains the view of the PFA that players are under no obligation to participate in matches when such risks are present. This includes the SCG.""

Football Federation Australia (FFA) will meet with Sydney FC and the Sydney Cricket Ground management on Monday to discuss the condition of the playing surface.
""If we're not confident that the ground will improve significantly then alternate venues would be sought in the future for Sydney FC home matches,"" A-League head Greg O'Rourke said in a statement.
""Whilst FFA understands the current demands on the surface...it appears that the needs of our code around surface condition may not be able to be met, despite the best intentions of all parties.""

SYDNEY — Sydney FC's top of the table A-League clash against Perth Glory this month has been moved away from the Sydney Cricket Ground after a furore over the 'dangerous' pitch at the iconic stadium during the weekend.
Australia's players' union joined Melbourne Victory boss Kevin Muscat in slamming the SCG pitch after visiting midfielder Terry Antonis suffered a knee injury during a match against Sydney FC on Saturday night.
Head of Leagues Greg O'Rourke said that although the Football Federation Australia (FFA) considered the surface to be ""playable and safe"", the April 18 fixture would be moved to Jubilee Oval ""in the best interests of all stakeholders"".
""The SCG's (cricket) wicket block ... compromises the uniformity of the field for football in particular,"" he said in a joint statement with Sydney FC and the SCG.
Antonis fell to the ground untouched on the edge of the cricket square during a 2-1 loss for his side in a clash between the last two Australian champions.
Professional Footballers Australia (PFA) called for an independent investigation into how the match was allowed to go ahead given the 'deplorable state' of the pitch, which the body said posed a clear danger to player safety.
The SCG is being used by soccer, rugby league and rugby union teams in addition to hosting its usual cricket and Australian Rules matches while the neighbouring Sydney Football Stadium (SFS) is re-built.
Some 3,000 square metres of turf were relaid after the surface was torn up during a rugby union match last month.
Sydney FC travel to city rivals Western Sydney Wanderers next weekend but are assured of still being in second place behind Perth, who are six points clear at the top of the A-League, going into the match the following week.
""This is a hugely important fixture with first playing second and we want the narrative to be about the football,"" Sydney FC Chief Executive Danny Townsend said.
""This is a decision made in the viewing interest of members and supporters.""

(Reuters) - West Indies fast bowler Alzarri Joseph picked up six wickets for 12 runs on his Indian Premier League (IPL) debut on Saturday, the best bowling figures in the competition's history.
Joseph bettered Sohail Tanvir's 6-14 for Rajasthan Royals in 2008 to lead the Mumbai Indians to a 40-run victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad.
""It's a dream start, can't get better than this,"" Joseph said. ""I just wanted to bowl to the plans. When they said I was playing, I decided to keep it simple and back myself.""
Indians captain Rohit Sharma paid tribute to Joseph.
""(It was a) sensational effort from Alzarri,"" Rohit said. ""To come out and play like that shows what he's capable of.""

MUMBAI — Kieron Pollard last turned out for West Indies in a one-day international in 2016 but the burly all-rounder has not given up hope of making the squad for this year's World Cup.
Contractual disputes between the players and Cricket West Indies have weakened the team for several years now with the frosty relations famously culminating in the 2014 tour of India being called off midway through the series.
There have been signs of a thaw recently, however, with a new leadership team in place at the board and former captain Chris Gayle returning to the ODI side for the recent series against England in a big boost ahead of the World Cup.
Pollard, like Gayle famed for his six-hitting prowess, returned to the West Indies fold after a year out to join the Twenty20 team for the three-match series in India last year.
""I am a cricketer, I am 31 years of age and I have lot of cricket left in me,"" Pollard told reporters after smashing 83 off 31 balls against Kings XI Punjab to lead the Mumbai Indians to a thrilling last-ball win on Wednesday.
""Every day I get the opportunity to play, I want to do my best. There has been a lot of turmoil in West Indies cricket over the last couple of years. But we have seen in the last couple of weeks there's a change.
""Pollard was one of the guys blacklisted. The most I can do every time I step on the cricket field is try to put runs on the board. There's people there who have the job to select and whatever and we'll see how that goes.
""As I said, I'm 31, Chris Gayle is still playing, he's 39, and he's still whacking it all around.""
Leading Mumbai in the absence of injured regular captain Rohit Sharma, Pollard helped his side to an unlikely win chasing Punjab's 197-4, which was built on an unbeaten 100 from KL Rahul and a typically punishing 63 from Gayle.
Pollard belted 10 sixes and three fours in his knock for Mumbai's fourth win in six matches this season, after they needed 104 off the last eight overs.
West Indies have proved in this year's IPL that they have no shortage of short-form matchwinners at their disposal in the likes of Pollard, Gayle, Sunil Narine and Andre Russell.
The twice world champions could therefore be a tough prospect for any opponent at the May 30-July 14 World Cup in England and Wales.
""We know what we can do and I think Chris batted superbly,"" Pollard said.
""A fellow West Indian is (Andre) Russell... he's smacking the ball and it's great to see the way he's hitting the ball and (Sunil) Narine.
""These guys are having a good tournament and again it's just about enjoying cricket, when your mind is free, you just go out and enjoy cricket.
""You don't think about much because there are a lot of opinions, there are a lot of things, but it's people as close to you and what they think matters.""

(Reuters) - Afghanistan replaced long-serving one-day international captain Asghar Afghan with Gulbadin Naib on Friday, less than two months before this year's 50-over World Cup in England and Wales.
Afghan, 31, took over the team's captaincy in 2015 after Mohammad Nabi had stepped down following the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.
Under his leadership, the war-torn South Asian country gained full membership status from the governing body International Cricket Council and also qualified for the 2019 World Cup.
Afghanistan's chief selector Dawalt Ahmadzai backed Naib to continue Afghan's legacy and said he was the right choice to lead the team at the World Cup.
""Asghar Afghan who captained team Afghanistan for a period of around four years achieved a lot and made the country proud,"" Ahmadzai said in a statement on the Afghan Cricket Board's (ACB) website https://www.cricket.af/acb-news-info/960.
""I hope Gulbadin Naib will be able to continue his legacy at the helm of the team's affairs.""
However, the news did not go down well with Afghan's predecessor Nabi, who took to Twitter to question the timing of the change.
""Being a senior member of the side and having seen the rise of Afghanistan cricket, I don't think it's the right time to change the captain before the WC,"" Nabi said.
""The team has gelled really well under Asghar and I personally feel he is the right man to lead us.""
The 28-year-old Naib, who bowls seam and bats in the middle order, has played 52 ODIs for Afghanistan since making his debut in 2011.
In wholesale changes to the leadership structure, all-rounder Rahmat Shah was appointed test captain replacing Afghan while leg-spinner Rashid Khan was put in charge of the Twenty20 team.
Rashid, who was also named vice-captain for the 50-over format, was even more vocal in his criticism of the move and called the decision to oust Afghan ""irresponsible"".
""With all the respect to the selection committee, I strongly disagree with the decision,"" Rashid said on Twitter. ""As we have the cricket World Cup in front of us... Asghar Afghan should remain as our team captain.
""With just months to go for such a mega event like World Cup, changing the captain will cause uncertainty and also team morale will be affected.""
The Afghan Cricket Board was not immediately available for comment.
Afghanistan will tour Scotland and Ireland next month to prepare for the World Cup and will also play an ODI each against Pakistan and England before kicking off their campaign against Australia on June 1.

NEW DELHI — Former captain Steve Smith laid to rest any concerns about his fitness and form ahead of the naming of Australia's World Cup squad with his first half century of this year's Indian Premier League on Sunday.
The 29-year-old Smith, who underwent elbow surgery earlier this year, top-scored with 73 not out for Rajasthan Royals in their relatively meagre total of 139 for three in Jaipur.
Smith's innings lasted just 59 balls but he was relatively circumspect at the start against some tight bowling from spinners Piyush Chawla and Sunil Narine.
West Indies all-rounder Narine (47) then combined with Australia's Chris Lynn (50) in a 91-run opening partnership in 8.1 overs to set up an eight-wicket victory with 37 balls to spare.
Despite the loss, Smith's innings would have pleased Australia's selectors as they mull over their squad for the defence of the one-day World Cup in England and Wales.
Instead of a traditional all-out attacking innings normal in the Twenty20 format, Smith worked the ball into gaps and had scored just 39 runs from his first 40 balls before he accelerated in the final overs.
The innings drew some praise from West Indies batting great Brian Lara during the commentary of the match.
""He is not a big-hitter of the ball,"" Lara said. ""He's not an Andre Russell or a Ben Stokes. He gets the gaps. I respect him.""Former England captain Michael Vaughan also tweeted that a six by Smith off Narine would put to bed any concerns over the elbow.
Smith's 12-month international ban for ball tampering only ended 10 days ago and he has started slowly with scores of 20, 28 and 38 in his three matches before Sunday's innings.
He had been playing mostly Twenty20 tournaments around the world during the ban. He also played club cricket in Sydney before having the surgery.
Both Smith and former Australia vice-captain David Warner missed last year's IPL following the imposition of the bans by Cricket Australia for their roles in the ball-tampering scandal that rocked their national team.
Australia are expected to name their team for the defence of their World Cup title over the next week, with the 15-man squads needing to be finalised by April 23.

MUMBAI — India captain Virat Kohli does not want performance at the ongoing Indian Premier League to determine team composition for this year's World Cup but selectors have little choice after a series of candidates failed to nail down the number four slot.
Twice 50-over champions India have an otherwise settled batting line-up with a formidable top order consisting of Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan and Kohli himself.
The selectors, however, continue to fret over who should walk out to bat after the fall of the second wicket during the May 30-July 14 showpiece tournament in England and Wales.
Ajinkya Rahane, Manish Pandey, Lokesh Rahul, Dinesh Karthik and Ambati Rayudu have all been trialled for the number four spot and found wanting.
With the ongoing IPL the only form of cricket left before Kohli's team embarks on their World Cup campaign, the selectors maybe forced to consider the form of the players in the T20 tournament before picking the squad ahead of the April 23 deadline.
""They have maintained that they won't look at IPL but it's going to be very hard,"" former India batsman Sanjay Manjrekar told Reuters in a recent interview.
""There are some borderline cases, like if they are looking at Dinesh Karthik, Ambati Rayudu and Vijay Shankar or a Manish Pandey or an Ajinkya Rahane. So all these people are there and thereabout.
""And if somebody has a great IPL season, it will be hard to ignore him, but they (selectors) should not actually get too carried away with what happens in the IPL.""
Rayudu, 33, emerged as the most likely choice to fill the void but scores of 13, 18 and two in the first three matches of the recent home series against world champions Australia hurt his cause.
Pressure is only mounting on the selectors with Rayudu, who plays for IPL champions Chennai Super Kings, scoring 28, five, one and zero in the first four matches of the tournament.
Manjrekar felt India were back to square one with no more ODIs scheduled before the World Cup in England and Wales, where the team will be looking to add to their 1983 and 2011 triumphs.
India's limited-overs vice-captain, Rohit, believes inputs from Kohli and coach Ravi Shastri should determine the selection of the final 15.
""With their inputs, the selectors will keep an eye on what is happening with those guys during the IPL,"" Rohit, who leads the Mumbai Indians side in the IPL, told reporters at the launch of cricket.com website on Thursday.
""Although I feel IPL shouldn't be the criterion for team selection. We have played enough international matches to see where each individual stands.
""You can't select a 50-overs format team based on a 20-overs franchise competition. IPL is a different ball game, it's franchise cricket.
""Yes form matters a lot. But in this last four years we have played enough ODI matches, we have played enough T20 internationals. So that should be enough to understand that these are the players we want.""

Each species of orchid is designed to attract a specific pollinator. The genes that make that possible are highly adaptable, scientists say.
By
C. Claiborne Ray
A.
The approximately 25,000 to 30,000 different species of orchid
evolved along with their many pollinators
— from bees, wasps and flies, to moths, butterflies, a cricket and even the occasional bird.
Many of the plant’s special shapes
accommodate just one pollinator or a closely related group of pollinators
. The flower may mimic the female of a pollinating insect, for example.
Orchids
make up about 10 percent of all extant flower types
, but their genome suggests that they all descended from a common ancestor. These descendants developed a special deck of genetic cards that can be reshuffled to produce many variations of their characteristic flower plan.
The plan involves bilateral symmetry, rather than radial symmetry; protective sepals alternating with petals; and usually a special lower petal, called a lip, that
can serve as a landing pad for pollinators
.
Scientists say that this strategy is well suited to efficient pollen transfer, and
can be adapted through evolution to attract different pollinators

WASHINGTON — The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday approved a bill on a 232 to 190 vote to reinstate landmark net neutrality protections adopted in 2015, but the effort faces an uphill battle to become law.
Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday the bill overturning a Federal Communications Commission December 2017 repeal would be ""dead on arrival"" in the Senate. The White House said Tuesday aides would recommend President Donald Trump veto the bill, which would reinstate rules barring providers from blocking or slowing internet content or offering paid ""fast lanes.""
The reversal of net neutrality rules has been a win for internet service providers (ISPs) such as Comcast Corp, AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc, but was opposed by companies like Facebook Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc.
Republicans have said the bill would open the door to the FCC imposing rate regulations or adding taxes to internet service similar to levies on cable or phone bills. Democrats say the bill is essential to ensuring the government enforces rules that prohibit improper conduct by internet providers and guarantee Americans access to an open internet.
Just one Republican, Florida Representative Bill Posley, voted with 231 Democrats. No Democrats voted against the measure.
Representative Mike Doyle, a Democrat, said Wednesday that after repealing net neutrality protections the FCC had replaced them with ""nothing, nada, zip, crickets. They did nothing. It's the wild, wild west -- let the ISPs do anything they want and consumers be damned.""
Under FCC chairman Ajit Pai, the commission voted 3-2 to hand ISPs sweeping powers to recast how Americans use the internet, as long as they disclose changes.
In a statement Wednesday, Pai called the House bill a ""big-government solution in search of a problem.""
USTelecom, a trade group, said internet providers support net neutrality protections but oppose the 2015 FCC order that reclassified the internet as a utility-style service that handed the FCC sweeping authority to regulate it.
A federal appeals court upheld the 2015 net neutrality rules, while another appellate panel is considering whether the 2017 FCC order is legal. California and some other states have adopted their own net neutrality rules but they are on hold pending the outcome of the challenge to Pai's order.

BANGALORE — West Indies finisher Andre Russell continued his destructive Indian Premier League form with an unbeaten 48 off 13 deliveries to lead the Kolkata Knight Riders to a five-wicket victory over Royal Challengers Bangalore on Friday.
Twice a world champion in the Twenty20 format, Russell hit seven sixes from nine balls in one purple patch as he drove his side to the win with five balls to spare, keeping Virat Kohli's Challengers winless in five matches in the process.
Kohli (84) and South African AB de Villiers (63) had combined for 108 of the home side's 205 for three but hopes of a first victory were dashed when their death bowlers were unable to contain Russell.
The 30-year-old Jamaican all-rounder, who has now hit a remarkable 207 runs off 77 balls with 22 sixes in four matches, came out to bat with his side needing 68 runs from 26 balls and proceeded to flay the bowling around the Chinnaswamy.
""I was watching on the tellie upstairs so I kind of knew what the wicket was doing,"" said Man of the Match Russell.
""Sixty off 20 odd balls is not going to happen every day so we had to make sure we put our bodies on the line and I didn't quit. I trust my strength and I trust my power and I have a good bat speed so I trust that as well.""
The home side were not helped by pacemen Mohammed Siraj being suspended midway through the 18th over for bowling a second beamer and Kohli said they deserved their place at bottom of the IPL standings.
""If we bowl like that, (and) don't show composure in pressure moments, we deserve to be where we are in the table,"" the India captain said.
""There's no rocket science behind it. We haven't played the kind of cricket we should be playing at the level of the IPL and if you bowl like that, with not enough bravery in the crunch moments, then it's always going to be difficult when you have power-hitters like Russell in the opposition.""
Russell, who struggled with knee problems at the back end of last year, will be hoping his sensational Twenty20 form will carry over to the 50-overs World Cup in England and Wales, which starts at the end of next month.

ISLAMABAD — Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan said he thinks there may be a better chance of peace talks with India if Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) wins the general election due to begin there on Thursday.
Khan said that if the next Indian government were led by the opposition Congress party, it might be too scared to seek a settlement with Pakistan over disputed Indian-controlled Kashmir, fearing a backlash from the right.
""Perhaps if the BJP - a right-wing party - wins, some kind of settlement in Kashmir could be reached,"" Khan told a small group of foreign journalists in an interview.
This was despite the massive alienation that Muslims in Kashmir and Muslims in general were facing in Modi's India, said Khan, who took office last August.
""I never thought I would see what is happening in India right now,"" said the former international cricket star. ""Muslim-ness is being attacked.""
Khan said Indian Muslims he knew who many years ago had been happy about their situation in India were now very worried by extreme Hindu nationalism.
He said Modi, like Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, was electioneering based on ""fear and nationalist feeling"".
The BJP's pledge this week to propose stripping decades-old special rights from the people of Jammu and Kashmir, which prevent outsiders from buying property in the state, was a major concern, though it could also be electioneering, Khan said.
Khan did appear to offer India an olive branch, saying that Islamabad was determined to dismantle all Pakistan-based militias in the country, and that the government had full support from Pakistan's powerful army for the program. Those to be dismantled include groups involved in Kashmir.
Nuclear-armed neighbors Pakistan and India both claim Kashmir in full but rule in part.
Khan said Kashmir was a political struggle and there was no military solution, adding that Kashmiris suffered if armed militants from Pakistan came across the border, leading to Indian army crackdowns.
Relations between Pakistan and India, which have fought three wars since gaining independence from Britain in 1947, two over Kashmir, reached a crisis point in February after a suicide bombing killed 40 Indian paramilitary police in Kashmir.
Islamabad denied responsibility for the Feb. 14 attack, which was claimed by Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed, but the bombing prompted India to carry out a cross border air strike against what it said was a militant training camp in Pakistan.
Pakistan responded with air strikes of its own.
Pollsters say Modi and the BJP's re-election bid got a boost from a wave of patriotism after the suicide bomb attack and the Indian government's fast response.
Khan said there was still the possibility if the polls turn against Modi in the next few weeks that India could take some further military action against Pakistan.
The rolling election is held in phases and does not finish until May 19. The result is not due until May 23.
Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi warned on Sunday that Islamabad had ""reliable intelligence"" that India would attack again this month. India described the claim as irresponsible.
Khan said that it was vital for Pakistan to have peace with its neighbors, Afghanistan, India and Iran, if it was to have the kind of economy needed to pull 100 million people out of poverty.

ISLAMABAD — Pakistan's push to curb armed militant groups in the wake of a standoff with India that brought the nuclear-armed neighbors close to war reflected an urgent need for stability to meet growing economic challenges, Prime Minister Imran Khan said.
Facing a financial crisis and heavy pressure to take on militant groups to avoid sanctions from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global money laundering and terror finance watchdog, Khan said Pakistan was acting in its own interests.
""Everyone now knows that what is happening in Pakistan has never happened (before),"" Khan told a group of foreign journalists at his office in Islamabad on Tuesday, outlining a push to bring the more than 30,000 madrasas across Pakistan under government control and rehabilitate thousands of former militants.
""We have decided, this country has decided, for the future of the country - forget outside pressure - we will not allow armed militias to operate,"" he said.
The comments underline a push by Pakistan to improve its image after years of accusations that its security services have exploited militant groups as proxies against neighbors, including India and Afghanistan.
Islamabad has consistently denied the accusations and said Pakistan has suffered more from militant violence than any other country, with tens of thousands of deaths and billions of dollars in economic damage over recent decades.
But Khan, a former cricket star, implicitly accepted the role played by Pakistan in fostering and steering militant groups that grew out of the U.S.-backed mujahideen fighting Soviet forces in neighboring Afghanistan in the 1980s.
""We should never have allowed them to exist once jihad was over,"" he said, rejecting suggestions that he could face opposition from the powerful military and the ISI, Pakistan's main intelligence agency.
""Today, we have the total support of the Pakistan army and intelligence services in dismantling them,"" Khan said. ""What use has ISI of them any more? These groups were created for the Afghan jihad.""
BROKEN PROMISES
Pakistan's critics, including India, have dismissed Khan's promises of a crackdown, saying similar pledges have been repeatedly made by previous governments only to be quietly dropped once attention shifted.
They point to Pakistan's continued failure to arrest Masood Azhar, leader of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), the group which claimed responsibility for the Feb. 14 attack in Pulwama district of Indian-controlled Kashmir that killed 40 paramilitary police.
Khan said Pakistan was constrained by the need to build a legal case that would stand up in court but said Azhar had been driven underground and was ""ineffective"" and unwell.
""More important than him is the set-up and that is being dismantled,"" he said.
Although Khan insisted that the actions against militant groups were being undertaken for Pakistan's own benefits, his government, which came to power last August, faces severe economic headwinds that have made international support vital.
In discussions with the International Monetary Fund over what would be its 13th bailout since the 1980s, Pakistan is struggling to stay off the FATF blacklist, which would bring heavy economic penalties.
""We can't afford to be blacklisted, that would mean sanctions,"" Khan said.
With a currency that has lost more than a quarter of its value over the past year, a yawning current account deficit and galloping inflation running at over nine percent, Pakistan is in desperate need of a respite to get its economy on track.
Elected on a platform of tackling the endemic corruption that has helped cripple Pakistan's economy, Khan said his top priority was to take 100 million people, or around half the population, out of poverty.
""You can only do this if there is stability in Pakistan.""

(Reuters) - David Warner continued to blaze his way through the Indian Premier League with the bat but his misfield helped Kings XI Punjab to a dramatic victory over his Sunrisers Hyderabad on Monday.
The aggressive opener scored 70 not out from 62 balls for the Sunrisers, confirming his strong form ahead of his expected return to the Australia team for the 50-overs World Cup in England and Wales.
It was his third half century in six matches and extended his hold at the top of the IPL run-scoring table with 349 runs at an average of 87.25.
He has scored a century in addition to the three half centuries, indicating there is little rust in his game despite the one-year international ban for his part in the Newlands ball-tampering scandal.
The suspension ended on March 29 and the 32-year-old is all but certain to be included in Australia's squad for the May 31-July 14 World Cup when it is announced this week.
While Warner batted the entire 20 overs of Hyderabad's innings, tight bowling and muggy conditions in Mohali meant he was required to work hard as he guided his side 150 for four.
India opener KL Rahul's 71 not out then led the Kings XI to a six-wicket victory with a ball to spare.
Hyderabad did well to force the game into a final over by taking three quick wickets for eight runs in just 12 balls, leaving Punjab needing 11 runs from the last six.
Rahul and England all-rounder Sam Curran scored nine from Mohammad Nabi's first four deliveries before Rahul hit the ball to Warner at long on.
Warner fumbled it then slipped over on the dewy surface as he went to retrieve it, allowing Rahul and Curran to scamper through for the victory.
Punjab are third in the IPL standings with four wins from six matches, trailing Kolkata and Chennai, who have both played only five games, on net run rate. Hyderabad are fourth with three wins and three losses.

MUMBAI — The English weather will play a major role during the World Cup and teams from the Indian subcontinent stand to gain if hot and dry conditions prevail during the May 30-July 14 tournament, former captain Kevin Pietersen has said.
England, which last hosted the quadrennial showpiece in 1999, has witnessed more batsmen-friendly conditions in recent past with scores of 300 regularly posted in one-day internationals held in the country.
A hot English summer will translate into dry pitches on which the batsmen and spinners from the subcontinent teams are expected to thrive.
""It is going to be weather dependent,"" Pietersen told reporters in Mumbai at a promotional event last week.
""Last year was one of the most beautiful English summers since 1976. It was the hottest summer recorded in the UK with hardly any rain at all, conditions were extremely dry.
""If the conditions are like they were last summer, then I think the subcontinent teams are going to have a massive role to play in the World Cup.
""If they are not and it's horrible and green and seaming, then it's going to play in England's favour and the team that copes best in those circumstances.""
While many see it as England's best chance to win their maiden 50-overs World Cup, India will also be among the favourites.
Led by Virat Kohli, the two-time champions have more or less a settled batting line-up even though they continue to search for a reliable number four in the batting order.
Opener Rohit Sharma agreed the English conditions could have a big say on their team selection.
""I think we are pretty much settled. There are a few spots which everyone know about,"" Rohit, Kohli's deputy in limited-overs formats, said.
""It all depends on what the captain, coach and selectors think about the combination. Whether we need to go with the extra seamer, extra middle order batsman, extra opening batsman or an extra spinner.
""The conditions in England will matter the most. The last time when we were there the conditions were really dry. I don't know if it will be the same again. If it is like that then we need to get an extra spinner, as simple as that. If it's not then we should probably get an extra seamer.""
All 10 participating teams will have to submit their 15-member squads by April 23, while injury replacements can be named until May 23.

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — His country nearly went to war with a neighboring enemy six and a half times its size. Militants lurk in religious schools and in the countryside.
And with inflation soaring and debt ballooning, his finance team is scrambling, desperate to secure a multibillion-dollar rescue package to avoid economic collapse.
But Imran Khan, Pakistan’s prime minister, is apparently feeling confident about his first eight months in office — so much so that he invited a group of foreign journalists for an informal, hourlong chat on Tuesday in Islamabad, the capital.
While he seemed subdued, with puffy circles under his eyes, Mr. Khan also sought to project resolve — particularly about ridding Pakistan of the militants it once tolerated.
“We have decided, for the future of our country — forget the outside pressure — we will not allow armed militias to operate anymore,’’ he said.
“The Pakistan Army created them,’’ he said, referring to the 1980s when Pakistan and the United States backed Muslim insurgents in Afghanistan against Soviet forces.
But, he added, “there is no use for these groups anymore.’’
Mr. Khan, 66, sat in a brightly lit drawing room on a gold-painted chair. He wore a long white shalwar kameez with the sleeves crisply pressed and spoke about corruption, poverty and trying to make peace with the Taliban.
He reminisced about traveling the world as an international cricket star and expressed alarm about India’s shift toward Hindu nationalism and the rising crimes against India’s Muslims.
India used to be “a very open society,’’ he said. “I never thought that I would see what is happening in India right now. Muslim-ness is being attacked.’’
In August, Mr. Khan took over as the elected leader of one of the world’s most troubled countries. And he did with a shadow over him.
Many observers said that the election was deeply flawed and that Mr. Khan had been secretly helped by Pakistan’s powerful military, which cleared a path for him by harassing and threatening his political opponents. In many ways, he was a curious choice.
Pakistan is a conservative Muslim nation, and Mr. Khan, by contrast, was once an international playboy and celebrity athlete. He befriended notables like Princess Diana in a high-flying life that could not be more different from the lives of most Pakistanis, though in recent years he has mellowed and turned more toward Islam.
In office, Mr. Khan has struggled to right the economy and get the security forces to more effectively
crack down on
militant groups that shelter in Pakistan
.
Mr. Khan promised that this new crackdown would go far deeper than previous ones criticized as cosmetic. The government, for instance, plans to send 200,000 teachers to religious schools across the country to teach secular subjects like English and math. The intention, Mr. Khan’s aides said, was to deradicalize students.
His government sees the stakes as high.
An international watchdog group
, the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force, is on the brink of blacklisting and sanctioning Pakistan. If that happened,
Pakistan would face greater difficulties in obtaining the financial bailouts and loans it has sought.
“We can’t afford to be blacklisted,’’ he said on Tuesday.
But Mr. Khan has also won praise for his seemingly coolheaded and statesmanlike behavior during the
recent crisis with India
, which he helped de-escalate by releasing a captured Indian pilot and emphasizing peace. He seemed quite cognizant that the last thing Pakistan needed was a war.
On Feb. 26, around 3:30 a.m., Mr. Khan said he was awakened by a phone call. A top military official told him that
Indian warplanes had just crossed the border and conducted airstrikes
on Pakistani soil.
Pakistan and India have been bitter enemies since 1947 when Britain decolonized the Indian subcontinent and created two nations: the mostly Hindu India, and the mostly Muslim Pakistan. The two have warred several times.
This time, the spark was a suicide bombing in the disputed territory of Kashmir that killed dozens of Indian soldiers. India blamed Pakistan for supporting the militant group behind the attack and vowed revenge.
After learning that the Indian bombs had fallen into an empty ravine around Balakot (India said the bombs had struck a terrorist training camp), Mr. Khan said Pakistan opted for a measured response and bombed an empty area just across the Indian border.
“They hit our trees, so we thought we’d hit their stones,’’ he said.
When asked whether he or the country’s military establishment controls Pakistan, Mr. Khan said that they work closely. Independent analysts don’t disagree, but many Pakistanis still see Mr. Khan as the army’s puppet.
Even some of Mr. Khan’s own ministers have said that they worry the relationship could sour if Mr. Khan, famous for self-confidence and unpredictability, crosses the army bosses.
But in this case, after Pakistani forces shot down an Indian fighter jet and captured the pilot, Mr. Khan and the military seemed to agree the best response was to release the pilot, which eased tensions.
“I’ve played down the whole thing,’’ he said.
Now Mr. Khan is back to wrestling with the economy.
Pakistan has struggled for years with high unemployment, extremely low rates of tax collection, runaway corruption, and sluggish exports. The country’s trade deficit had swelled to $33 billion when Mr. Khan took office in August.
He blames Pakistan’s economic problems on his predecessors, especially the Sharif family, his political rivals.
“You can’t have the ruling elite siphoning off money and taking it abroad,’’ he said. “If you don’t hold them accountable, the country has no future.’’
With barely enough foreign reserves to cover the country’s monthly import bills, Mr. Khan’s government knows it needs
a large bailout from the International Monetary Fund
, but those often come with painful austerity conditions. His finance team has been reluctant to turn to the I.M.F. but now promises that a deal will be announced in the coming weeks.
On the streets, discontent is rising. People grumble about rising prices. Mr. Khan’s government is trying to slow down demand to keep the trade deficit from growing even bigger.
But his government’s decisions to raise levies on fuel and collect more taxes from ordinary Pakistanis, even if necessary for the economy’s long-term health, have made people even angrier. Economic growth is forecast to slow further, leading to even more joblessness.
Nonetheless, Mr. Khan said, “my first priority is to take 100 million people out of poverty.’’
Pakistani analysts say his priority is genuine but question how Mr. Khan can possibly pay for it.
“I’ve been pretty consistent of my criticism of the P.M. going back a long time,’’ said Mosharraf Zaidi, a newspaper columnist. “One thing that I cannot criticize him for is the core purpose of his being in public life, which is compassion.”
As far as India, Mr. Khan could not resist a few digs. He said that India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, had opted for airstrikes to please a domestic audience — India begins holding elections on Thursday.
But he added that Mr. Modi’s government might actually be the best possible option for settling the Kashmir conflict, because right-wing Hindus would support Mr. Modi in achieving it.
“We have more chance for peace,’’ he said, and then added with a smile, “except for this glitch of India’s election.’’
