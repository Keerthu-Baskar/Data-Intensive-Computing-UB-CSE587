CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — The summer of 2015 found the University of North Carolina in what some, including Jay M. Smith, a professor at the university, would characterize as a curious position.
A year earlier, a university-commissioned report had found that the African and Afro-American Studies Department had offered
nearly 200 fraudulent classes
over almost two decades. These classes had been disproportionately populated by athletes in the high-profile sports of football and basketball, who in some cases were steered by athletic department tutors who knew the courses required little work.
The result was one of the worst academic scandals in college sports history, and a huge black mark on a prestigious university and its proud athletic program. The university’s accreditation body placed North Carolina on probation. The N.C.A.A. conducted an investigation.
But critics saw few systemic changes.
“There’d been none of these public forums, no signs of lessons learned,” Smith said recently.
A
history professor
whose area of study is pre-Revolutionary France, Smith had been agitating about the scandal for several years. He had even written a book about the affair, “Cheated,” with a former learning specialist who helped blow the whistle on the classes.
“I thought, I cannot rely on this institution to do the right thing,” Smith said, “and I think it would be an abdication of responsibility for us to pass up the opportunity to provide students at this institution an opportunity to learn about their scandal — how it happened, what it says about college sports, what it tells us about the plight of athletes.”
And that is why earlier this week, as the men’s college basketball world turned its attention to the Final Four — an event the Tar Heels qualified for in 2016 and 2017, winning the title in the latter year — well over 100 undergraduates heard Smith lecture on the scandal as part of his increasingly popular course, History 383: Big-Time College Sports and the Rights of Athletes, 1874 to the Present.
Students in the class read “Cheated” and “Pay for Play: A History of Big-Time College Athletic Reform,” by Ronald A. Smith, as well as articles about the post-Civil War underpinnings of college football and the struggles of female and black athletes. The last quarter of the class, beginning this week, concerns the North Carolina scandal, including the much smaller controversy that arose over the course itself.
Smith is not trolling the university with the class, he said, although he wondered whether his superiors took it that way when two senior administrators seemed to be pressuring the then-department chair to cancel the course a few years ago. (The officials said their questions about the course had nothing to do with its content. The provost overturned a grievance committee’s finding that the officials’ interference had been undue.)
More righteous than self-righteous, Smith said the course is an earnest attempt to fight for a fairer college sports system, at North Carolina and elsewhere.
His class, he insisted, does not have an agenda. But it certainly has a point of view. And that includes the notion that efforts like the class itself are futile.
“By examining all these earlier episodes of growth followed by hand-wringing and efforts at reform, which inevitably fail — what they see is there are systemic features in college athletics that hardened over time and became ever more intractable,” Smith said.
Smith provides an unsentimental education that suggests a messy reality, one in which the scandal resulted from the workings of the college sports industry, including how it prevents athletes from getting a piece of the profits they generate.
While Smith has clarified in class that he is antagonistic to the college sports industry rather than to college athletes, this ambiguity leads to misconceptions, according to Lydia Thompson, a senior on the rowing team who is taking the class.
“Students hear critiques of the ways in which athletes have been abused by the educational system,” Thompson wrote in an email, “and automatically extrapolate those critiques and apply them to athletes who merely have to abide by the rules of that system.”
Smith has taught at Chapel Hill since 1990, having arrived during the era of good feelings associated with the legendary late basketball coach Dean Smith (no relation). “I drank the Kool-Aid,” he said.
Within three years of his arrival, though, according to a university report, the academic fraud had begun. It did not begin to come to light until 2011, right around when Jay Smith’s involvement with it commenced.
That summer, a football player named Mike McAdoo
sued the university
and the N.C.A.A. over his ineligibility related to another instance of academic misconduct. A student-run honors court had suspended him for submitting a paper in a Swahili class for which a tutor had formatted footnotes. But the paper, which was disclosed in court filings, included plagiarism, and that discovery led to a stream of revelations that eventually exposed the fake-classes scandal.
Smith was serving on a faculty committee overseeing the honors court. When a reporter asked to discuss McAdoo, Smith looked up the paper and was “flabbergasted,” he said, not only by its blatant evidence of plagiarism, but also because he knew the ostensible instructor of the course, Julius Nyang’oro, was not a language instructor. (Nyang’oro, the African and Afro-American Studies chair, was later found to be complicit in the scandal.)
“All of this smelled really, really fishy to me,” Smith said.
Smith and a few other faculty members convened an ad hoc group for academic reform. A neophyte when it came to college athletics, Smith was tutored by Richard Southall, a professor who directed the university’s College Sport Research Institute.
Southall, whose institute is now housed at the University of South Carolina, said he gave the group a “primer” on college sports, with the thesis that scandals are the regular, inevitable consequence of the conflict between the N.C.A.A.’s amateurism model and market forces such as fan interest and player value.
“Players understand their market value, coaches understand it, everybody understands it,” Southall said in an interview.
To hear Smith tell it, the course, first taught over the summer of 2016, came naturally to him. As a historian, he said, “you look for developments over time, charting both continuities and change, and you identify the issues that seem to be at stake.”
“I want them to leave the class with a reform spirit,” he added. “I want them to have a fresh appreciation for the way the system mistreats the athletes and why we need radical new thinking to correct those inequities.”
Ally Mastroianni, a sophomore on North Carolina’s lacrosse team, said she had enrolled in Smith’s class out of a sense of responsibility. “I did want to learn about the scandal,” she said. “I feel as an athlete I should know the facts.”
Her days are long, she said, filled with practice, rehab, classes, meals, homework and maybe some social time. Her main complaint about the relatively new Loudermilk Center for Excellence, a state-of-the-art athlete support center in the football stadium, is that it does not stay open past 10 p.m.
“When I see people rolling their eyes, it’s hurtful,” she said of her classmates’ attitude toward Loudermilk, which Smith’s students toured. “I don’t think it’s just a sham.”
Still, she did not regret enrolling in Smith’s course. It is, she said, “probably the most interesting class I’ve taken at U.N.C.”

LOS ANGELES — The lawsuit recently filed by the U.S. women's soccer team is part of a wider public ""awakening"" to the challenges that women athletes face, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti told Reuters on Saturday.
Speaking on the sidelines of the launch of an initiative aimed at the development of more women coaches, Garcetti said the suit against the U.S. Soccer Federation alleging wage discrimination marked an important step toward gender equality.
""I think there is an awakening happening in women's sports whether it's abuse, discrimination or simply having basic civil rights denied,"" he told Reuters.
""I support women athletes who are saying enough is enough. That for too long the federations have not done right by them to protect them and empower them,"" he said.
""It's an exciting moment to see that happening.""
Closing the pay gap between male and female athletes is critical to attracting women to professional sports, which will in turn boost the popularity of women's sports leagues, he said.
Women would no longer accept being treated as second class citizens by their sports, he said, and will demand a greater share of the overall wealth it generates going forward.
""The WNBA survives and it has been great to see it survive but women who play in the WNBA have to cobble together jobs in Europe in between,"" he said.
""We have to step up as a society and say this matters and that men and women should be on as equal a footing as we can be.""
The next generation of woman athletes will be better served if they can see similarities between themselves, their coaches and the sports icons they look up to, U.S. gold medalist gymnast Laurie Hernandez said at the Women Coach LA launch event.
""I took it as a really big responsibility to be a role model for these kids,"" she told a gathering of about 400 women at the kickoff for the initiative, which is a partnership between the City of LA and Nike.
""Growing up I didn't see many, if any, Hispanic gymnasts and I just resorted to being my own person,"" she said.
""I guess I didn't realize how big of a deal it was to be a Hispanic American on the Olympic team because then so many little girls started becoming gymnasts,"" she said.
""And it's because they saw someone that looked like them.""

(Reuters) - Former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) featherweight Artem Lobov, a long-time friend and team mate of Conor McGregor, is set to make a lucrative debut in bare-knuckle boxing as combat sports bid to gain more mainstream acceptance.
Nicknamed the ""Russian Hammer"", Lobov told Reuters he had accepted a big payday from the Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship to fight another UFC veteran, Jason Knight, on a pay-per-view card in Biloxi, Mississippi on Saturday.
""I'd be lying if I didn't tell you that money was a big factor in signing for Bare Knuckle - we're prize fighters, and our success is measured by the size of our purse,"" he said during a stopover in New York.
Long considered the only realistic professional alternative outside of boxing for combat sports athletes, the UFC is now competing with other mixed martial arts and grappling promotions.
European and Asian promotions are attracting sellout crowds, and the Bellator organization recently signed a large number of British and Irish prospects to try to make inroads in Europe.
They were also on the trail of Lobov when he was released from the UFC in January.
""They made a very nice offer, a lot more than I was getting in the UFC, but it did not match the offer that Bare Knuckle made. With Bare Knuckle, I can also accept other offers as long as it doesn't interfere with their schedule, so it's a win-win for me,"" the 32-year-old said.
""I get to go in, fight bare-knuckle, make a lot of money, hopefully build a better name for myself and then see what else is out there.""
FRONT FOOT
Though he has a losing professional record of 14 wins and 15 losses, Lobov is hugely popular with fans due to his fearless style of fighting off his front foot and his toughness, with 12 of his MMA losses coming by decision.
Lobov brushes aside the suggestion that bare-knuckle boxing is more primitive than MMA.
""It might seem that way, but getting hit with a bare knuckle is not as raw as getting hit with a bare knee, or getting kicked with a shin to your head, which I have been a few times,"" he said. ""In that sense, it's nothing.
""I truly, truly love fighting, so that's not an issue for me. It's like saying to a swimmer, 'Do you mind getting wet?' Of course not, he's a swimmer,"" he said.
Lobov credits Irishman McGregor, the former UFC featherweight and lightweight champion, with bringing combat sports into the mainstream in the U.S. and enabling him and many others to make a living as fighters.
""In many ways it is thanks to Conor, for sure, and it's definitely a lot better than before, but the best times are still ahead of us,"" Lobov said.
""Ten years ago I fought a top-10 European fighter on four days' notice for 400 pounds, and to go from that to where I am now, earning six figures for a fight? Certainly, I see the improvements in the sport.""
Though delighted to have a chance to test his boxing without the threat of kicks or takedowns, Lobov will be back in the MMA cage soon.
""I always seek the biggest challenge and MMA is the biggest challenge. I'm still grappling, I'm still wrestling and doing everything,"" he said.
""I want to improve and to achieve many, many things in MMA, boxing and bare-knuckle boxing.""

NEW YORK — Two congressmen want Major League Baseball to produce documents by April 25 tied to its attempt to purchase control of 21 regional sports networks.
The two Democrats are Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, chairman of the House oversight and reform committee, and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, chairman of the subcommittee on economic and consumer policy.
They wrote to baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred on Thursday, saying they are wary of ""anticompetitive conduct."" They asked for documents on potential acquisition and operation of the regional networks plus MLB's strategies. They also want MLB officials to brief committee staff.
The Walt Disney Co. acquired 22 regional sports networks as part of its $71 billion purchase of 21st Century Fox's entertainment business last month. The Justice Department said last June that Disney had to sell the networks as a condition of the deal. The Yankees' YES Network is being sold separately by Disney.
""We are concerned that MLB's potential expansion of its business to RSNs could increase the risk of anticompetitive conduct that harms American consumers and, in turn, baseball itself,"" the congressmen wrote. ""This potential expansion also raises the question of whether additional limits on the league's antitrust exemption are warranted.""
Baseball was granted an antitrust exemption in 1922 by the Supreme Court, which ruled the sport was not interstate commerce. Congress passed a limited cutout that was signed into law in 1998, making the employment of major league players subject to antitrust law.

ST. PAUL, Minn. — Native American tribes have emerged as key players in the legislative debates over whether states should legalize sports betting.
Some oppose the idea because it could threaten their casinos. Others support legalization, but only if they retain a monopoly.
In many states, tribes are fighting sports betting or taking a go-slow approach because they worry it could force them to reopen decades-old agreements. Those agreements give them exclusive rights to operate casinos and offer certain forms of gambling.
In others, including North Carolina and Connecticut, casino-operating tribes are the ones leading the legalization efforts.
A U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year opened the door to expanding legalized sports betting beyond Nevada.

MINNEAPOLIS — The toilet paper was already flying at Toomer's Corner, the spot where the biggest celebrations go down when Auburn's sports teams win big.
Then, the whistle blew.
A foul. Three free throws.
A comeback win transformed into a devastating loss.
And within seconds, the pain and second-guessing of the final plays flowed from everywhere. From TV: ""Man, I want to cry right now ,"" said Auburn alum Charles Barkley. From Twitter on a non-call: ""Were they paid by Virginia? "" From the headlines: ""Foul Play .""
Lost somewhere amid all that agony at Auburn and euphoria in Virginia heading to the NCAA Tournament final was the fact that we've seen all this before.
No official is perfect.
No instant replay is going to fend off all mistakes.
Even when the call is the right one, sports aren't always fair.
And when they're being played on the biggest stages, those facts of life are placed out there on vivid, often heart-wrenching display.
""At that level, you'd hope it's not going to happen because of what's at stake, but it's going to happen,"" said John O'Suillivan, founder of the Changing The Game Project , which teaches about keeping perspective in youth sports. ""It has always happened, and it always will.""
Virginia earned a date with Texas Tech in Monday's national title game because of the foul and those three free throws, to say nothing of the whistles that weren't blown in the moments before.
In Virginia's 63-62 win over Auburn on Saturday, the discussion about whether Samir Doughty fouled Kyle Guy as Guy was shooting a 3-pointer with 0.6 seconds remaining turned out to be the simplest part of the debate.
More difficult to untangle: Should that foul have been called under those circumstances? Many see it simply, others point out that worse infractions have been ignored.
And what about the Ty Jerome, the Virginia guard who lost the ball, picked it up and then started dribbling again, on the play that came seconds earlier near midcourt? Should that have been whistled? And why didn't the refs call a foul when Bryce Brown grabbed Jerome's jersey as Jerome was trying to re-collect the ball just before he double-dribbled?
It all happened in the blink of an eye — much easier to detect, and break down, with the help of super slow-motion and a couple different angles that none of the three officials had the luxury of seeing either while it was happening, or directly after it occurred. It was a judgment (non) call, so it wasn't subject to being reviewed, the way many tough, late-game calls are under the rules in college hoops.
""I would challenge anyone complaining about that call, I'd say, 'Did you recognize that in real time?'"" said Dean Blandino, the former vice president of officiating for the NFL. ""It's just one of those unusual plays that happen. When I used to be in officials' meetings, we would always say, 'Something is going to come up that's never happened before, so you just have to anticipate that.'""
But how to react to something that's never happened before?
Less than three months ago, the Los Angeles Rams made the Super Bowl at the expense of the New Orleans Saints in the wake of an unthinkable non-call of an obvious pass-interference infraction late in that game.
The NFL got pilloried for the call. Lawsuits were filed. The commissioner, Roger Goodell, got destroyed during his annual Super Bowl press conference for failing to promise immediate change.
Only last week did the league's teams vote to make pass interference calls, and non-calls, reviewable .
""But you do that, and you're potentially creating a whole host of other issues,"" Blandino said.
Only time will tell what they are.
Serena Williams in tennis. Dustin Johnson in golf. The 1972 U.S. Olympic basketball team . The ""Hand of God "" in soccer. Fifth down for Colorado in college football.
Blown calls, controversial calls and calls that were ""correct"" according to the rulebook but questionable given the circumstances are nothing new to sports. Sometimes, the reaction of the wronged party can be as memorable as the call itself.
After Saturday's whistle, Auburn coach Bruce Pearl, apoplectic at first, diffused the situation as best he could: ""There are lots of calls during the game, and you're going to get some, and some you're not going to get,"" he said.
That's boilerplate material for good sportsmanship and teaching your players, and fans, how to handle the toughest of situations.
Similar emotions sometimes manifest themselves in other types of cruel or redeeming moments. On Sunday, Guy explained how his winning free throws followed a year rebuilding his confidence after Virginia's historic 16-over-1 loss last year. A few hours later, Notre Dame star Arike Ogunbowale lost a chance to repeat as hero in the women's NCAA final by missing a free throw she intended to make and then making a free throw she intended to miss.
In general, O'Sullivan warns it's not good to use the examples set in elite sports as lessons for how to behave at the youth or recreational level.
""Those are two different things,"" he said. ""One is sport for entertainment, the other is sport for development.""
Sometimes, especially in places where sports are so enmeshed with daily life, they seem hard to separate.
But even at Toomer's Corner in Auburn, the sun came up the next morning. America started counting down to Monday night's big game, and fans on every side could agree on one thing: Hopefully an official's call won't decide it.
""Regardless of the circumstances, we're all human,"" said Craig Littlepage, the former athletic director at Virginia. ""We all have to realize that it's sports. There are going to be mistakes made along the way.""

The sports radio personality Craig Carton was sentenced to three and a half years in prison on Friday by a longtime fan and listener — the judge — for a ticket reselling scheme that ended his broadcast partnership with the former N.F.L. quarterback Boomer Esiason.
Carton, convicted in November of conspiracy, wire fraud and securities fraud, was sentenced by Chief Judge Colleen McMahon in Manhattan federal court.
She greeted him like a radio listener.
“Good afternoon, Mr. Carton. Colleen from New York. First time, long time,” the judge said, adding that she used to listen to his show as she drove to court.
“I knew you could be fun to listen to,” she said. “I also knew you could be a jerk.”
The prison term was half of what prosecutors sought after Carton was convicted at a November trial of soliciting and then largely gambling away nearly $7 million.
Geoffrey S. Berman, United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a release that Carton’s ticket resale business, which purported to use his connections to obtain good seats for events like Metallica and Barbra Streisand concerts, was an “elaborate fiction.”
Carton, a 50-year-old Manhattan resident, blamed his fall from a measure of celebrity and wealth on “wildly stupid decisions” he made as he tried to cope with memories of being sexually abused at age 11.
He said memories of the abuse were set off by revelations of the crimes of Jerry Sandusky, a former Penn State football assistant who was convicted of child sexual abuse in 2012. That led him first to speak angrily and more emotionally than he ever had before on WFAN’s “Boomer and Carton” show, which he co-hosted for years with Esiason. Then he could not sleep.
“Nobody knows what it’s like when lights go out and you lay in bed awake and the demons come,” Carton said.
He recalled turning to blackjack and eventually developing a gambling addiction so serious that winning and losing became irrelevant.
Carton said his arrest in 2017 was a “lightning bolt of awareness for me.” He said he had joined Gamblers Anonymous and was undergoing therapy.
“I am truly powerless over this disease,” Carton said. His last bet — a loss — came in June, he added.
Before describing the sentence, the judge said she had enjoyed Carton’s show, except when it became too “raunchy.”
But she likened his crimes to those of the financier Bernard L. Madoff, who is serving a 150-year prison sentence, though she said Madoff’s scheme, in which he squandered roughly $20 billion, went on far longer.
The judge dismissed Carton’s claims that he never meant to lose investors’ money, saying it was a common justification in financial crimes.
“The money always runs out at some point, and only then do you realize the road to your personal hell was truly paved with your good intentions,” she said.
“Craig Carton, you have indeed descended into a hell of your own making,” the judge said. “Everything you spent a lifetime of building up is gone. Your marriage is over. Your family is decimated. Your kids are terrified. Your career is in tatters. Your reputation is lost.”
She did, however, praise Carton’s plan to publicly urge others to stop gambling as she ordered him to pay $4.8 million in restitution and to forfeit $4.2 million. He also must do 150 hours of community service.
She said Carton could perhaps someday resume a radio show, which he left after his arrest, but she noted one of the biggest advertisers on sports radio shows seemed to be legal gambling businesses.
“That troubles me,” the judge said.
Carton must report to prison on July 15.

(Reuters) - Sports Direct chief Mike Ashley has offered to underwrite a 150 million pound rights issue at Debenhams on condition he is named CEO of the British department store chain, the Financial Times reported on Saturday, citing two sources.
The owner of the sportswear firm is also considering a 60 million pounds takeover bid for Debenhams this weekend, the Sunday Times said in a separate report.
A formal offer is being put together by him and would come with conditions, the Sunday Times said, citing an unnamed source.
Debenhams secured 200 million pounds in new funds last week but warned that shareholders still face being wiped out unless it secures financial support from Sports Direct, which holds a near 30 percent stake.
Debenhams said Sports Direct needed to either make a firm offer for the group, underwrite a rights issue of new stock, or provide debt funding if it wanted to prevent Debenhams falling into the hands of its lenders.
In a letter to the Debenhams board dated April 5, Sports Direct said it would be willing to underwrite the group with 150 million pounds in cash if Ashley was named as CEO, the FT said.
Sports Direct was not immediately available for comment and Debenhams declined to comment.
Last year Sports Direct bought department store chain House of Fraser out of administration and it has been trying to wrest control of Debenhams for months to further beef up its presence in the sector.

Robin and David Kowalski barely recognized their daughter Bailey when she was visiting home in White Lake, Mich., in the spring of 2015.
Their perennially positive daughter, who was about to finish her freshman year at Michigan State, was sullen. She had suddenly decided to abandon her long-held dream of being a sports journalist, and she refused to tell her mother, in whom she typically confided everything, why.
It was not until October, after months of erratic behavior, that Ms. Kowalski told her parents that she had been raped by three Michigan State basketball players that April. The incident left her depressed and considering harming herself. She dropped out of college for a while and received counseling. She gave up sports journalism for good.
Last year, Ms. Kowalski, 22, who is speaking publicly about her case for the first time, sued Michigan State in federal court for violating her rights under Title IX, the federal law mandating gender equity in higher education, as a Jane Doe. The lawsuit asserts that Michigan State mishandles sexual misconduct complaints against athletes. One woman said two football players raped her in 2009, but she was not advised of her Title IX rights, the lawsuit said, and another woman said three basketball players raped her in 2010, after which the accusations were not reported outside the athletic department.
A Michigan State motion to dismiss the case is pending. A university spokeswoman, Emily Guerrant, declined to comment on the case while the litigation is ongoing but said Michigan State “is dedicated to making sure every student receives fair treatment and support when they need it.”
Ms. Kowalski has decided to come forward, hoping she can persuade other victims, at Michigan State or elsewhere, to tell their stories.
According to Ms. Kowalski, when a university counselor learned that the men who she said assailed her were members of the basketball team — a storied and treasured program that has played in 10 Final Fours, including this year’s — the counselor discouraged her from reporting it, the lawsuit said.
“If you pursue this, you are going to be swimming with some really big fish,” a staff member told Ms. Kowalski, the lawsuit said.
Ms. Kowalski plans to hold a news conference in East Lansing on Thursday, the fourth anniversary of the incident. A month later, she will graduate from Michigan State.
“I don’t want any other girl who has gone through this or who God forbid may have to go through something like this to feel for one second that they should be too afraid to come out and do something,” Ms. Kowalski said in a phone interview last week.
Her lawyer, Karen Truszkowski, said that a separate Title IX investigation initiated by the university last June had dragged on.
“It will not be resolved within a year,” said Ms. Truszkowski, who declined to discuss the substance of the investigation because it is pending. “That has consumed her entire senior year.”
Ms. Kowalski is still declining to name the men she says raped her on the night of April 11, 2015. All were members of the 2014-15 Spartans team, she said. She has not filed a police report, but is considering doing so.
It’s still unclear to Ms. Kowalski who at Michigan State eventually learned about what she told the counselor. “I still to this day don’t know who knew,” she said. “How far up. Who was the last person to know about what I told the counselor in the counseling center the day I went in?”
More than a year ago, Michigan State’s president and athletic director resigned after the depredations of Lawrence G. Nassar, the former university doctor who has been accused of sexual abuse by hundreds of women, including Olympic gymnasts, and convicted of sex crimes, became a source of national outrage.
Also last winter, ESPN
reported
several previously undisclosed sexual misconduct allegations against members of Michigan State’s football and men’s basketball programs. In several instances, ESPN said, the accusations were handled by the athletics program, rather than the venues mandated by federal law.
“There’s a lot that they have yet to take accountability for, as far as what’s going on in the athletic department and the systematic errors that are allowing the athletic department to be put above females that have been victims of sexual assault by athletes,” Ms. Kowalski said.
The lawsuit states that the sexual assault occurred in April 2015 after an informal celebration at an East Lansing bar for the basketball team, which had recently returned from the Final Four in Indianapolis, where it lost to the eventual champion, Duke, in the national semifinals. (Ms. Kowalski, days away from turning 19, said she used fake identification to enter the bar.)
Ms. Kowalski’s roommate encouraged her to approach the players.
“I knew their stats, numbers, everything,” Ms. Kowalski said, adding, “She knew how I looked up to those guys.”
A team member invited Ms. Kowalski to his place for a party, and she accepted a drive to an off-campus apartment, the lawsuit said. When she arrived, there was no one else there, and Ms. Kowalski, who had already had trouble holding her glass at the bar despite not drinking much, had trouble controlling her thumbs to send a text, the lawsuit said.
The three players took turns raping her, the lawsuit said. She woke up later in the apartment and took a taxi back to her dorm.
Ms. Kowalski visited the Michigan State University Counseling Center roughly a week later, she said. The counselor she met with appeared to change her response to Ms. Kowalski upon learning that the men she said had attacked her were members of the basketball team. The counselor immediately insisted on having a second person in the room, the lawsuit said. Ms. Kowalski was not advised to seek a physical exam or pregnancy or S.T.D. testing, and was not made aware of her rights under Title IX.
With cases with “guys with big names,” she was told, according to the lawsuit, the best thing was to “just get yourself better.”
“She lived with that thought of, ‘Just get yourself better,’” said her mother, Robin Kowalski, in a phone interview last week.
When Bailey Kowalski first sued Michigan State last spring, the university rebutted her claims in a statement with significant and unusual detail. “We have not found any evidence or indication that she was discouraged in any way to make a Title IX complaint or a complaint to the police department,” it said. It also said that the university police eventually contacted her.
A day later, Michigan State’s former interim president, John Engler, said in a statement, “We regret that we provided an unnecessary amount of detail” in the initial response.
“They went out to the press and essentially addressed my lawsuit as a lie,” Ms. Kowalski said, “which basically was a message to anyone else coming forward with allegations similar to mine that, ‘If you’re going to do that, we’re going to completely exploit you.’”
After taking much of a semester off and receiving outpatient psychiatric treatment, Ms. Kowalski elected to return to Michigan State, believing that transferring to an unknown campus where she did not know anyone would have been worse. Her brother is currently a sophomore at Michigan State.
She suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, she said, and felt she could never return to the vocation to which she had long aspired. She switched from a planned double-major in journalism and Spanish to one in biology. She hopes eventually to become a veterinarian.

Tiger Woods is taking his match-play prowess on the road -- again -- in a series of head-to-head matches set to stream on GolfTV's over-the-top (OTT) platforms, according to Discovery president and CEO David Zaslav.
Zaslav announced the news on Wednesday while speaking at the CAA World Congress of Sports at Monarch Beach Resort in Dana Point, Calif., and said one match is already planned for Tokyo and most will take place outside of the United States.
No timeline was given for when the matches will begin.
""Tiger is going to decide what is the best format,"" Zaslav said. ""Should it be one-on-one? Two-on-two? Should we have two matches going on at the same time? But he's all in.""
GolfTV was announced last year as part of a long-term partnership between Discovery and the PGA Tour. In November 2018, Discovery secured a multi-year deal with Woods to provide exclusive content for the international streaming service, which launched in January.
Zaslav cited Woods' made-for-TV spectacle, ""The Match,"" with Phil Mickelson last Thanksgiving weekend as inspiration for the GolfTV series. The event, hosted by Turner Sports as a pay-per-view event on its B/R Live platform, logged 750,000 unique users.
""We looked at it and said, ‘(That's) pretty interesting,'"" he said. ""One million people came in and wanted to watch it -- could we improve on it? What could we do? So, we're going to do a number of those type events (and) Tiger's excited about it.""
Woods lost to Denmark's Lucas Bjerregaard in the quarterfinals of last week's WGC-Dell Match Play in Austin, Texas. His next Tour start will be next week's Masters, where Woods will go for his fifth green jacket and first since 2005.

MINNEAPOLIS — This Final Four is the fifth anniversary of one of the most effective, if inadvertent, instances of athlete activism in college sports.
This was when the Connecticut star Shabazz Napier, speaking to the news media shortly before the 2014 national championship game, said that he sometimes did not have enough to eat.
“There are hungry nights that I go to bed and I’m starving,” he said.
Within weeks, the N.C.A.A.’s board of directors for Division I voted to
lift
restrictions on how much teams could feed their players. No longer would there be bizarre hairsplitting over what was and was not a meal (notoriously, serving peanuts
did not count
, while serving peanut butter did). Now teams can and do routinely give athletes feasts.
This common-sense reform had been in the works and probably would have occurred eventually. But the stark comments by a high-profile player at the N.C.A.A.’s signature event ensured the nearly immediate change and boatloads of attention on the N.C.A.A.’s power over college athletes.
It is fruitful to remember the efficacy of Napier’s comments, because we are at a moment when it appears that further reform to college sports’ much-maligned policy of amateurism will come only from within. The players will have the foremost and maybe even exclusive power to agitate for change.
What would have happened if Zion Williamson had said, after his Nike shoe exploded, jeopardizing his career, that enough was enough, that he no longer would wear a shoe for nothing while his coach was at least indirectly paid millions by Nike? And that no other player should put up with this hypocrisy, either?
“The power is with labor and the players,” said Kain Colter, the former Northwestern quarterback who led a unionization drive among his teammates several years ago.
This was most obviously displayed in 2015, when Missouri football players threatened to sit out a game unless the university president stepped down or was fired. He stepped down. That the boycott concerned the campus’s racial climate rather than the players’ compensation ought not conceal the reality of what happened: The players — unpaid, un-unionized — flexed their muscles, and the system gave in.
Vesting power in athletes to reform sports is not historically aberrant. From Jackie Robinson withstanding taunts, threats and worse to break Major League Baseball’s color line; to baseball players striking in the 1970s and ’80s to gain and keep full-fledged free agency; to the track standout Edwin Moses devising benefits for Olympic athletes, athletes have often been the ones bringing about change. Their leverage is unmatched: They are the ones the fans pay to see, and therefore the ones who ultimately have the power over profit.
And they are the only ones with a steady interest in, well, their own interest.
Consider what else has happened since Napier’s comments.
Colter’s unionization effort, which a National Labor Relations Board regional director endorsed weeks before Napier’s Final Four, was squashed by the overall board.
The antitrust lawsuit that might have allowed players to profit off the use of their likenesses in video games and other media ended in an extremely limited victory for players.
Last month, a second antitrust suit, which sought to explode the N.C.A.A.’s ban on compensation, concluded at the district-court level with a technical victory for players that
looked as much like a victory for the establishment
. A federal judge ruled that the N.C.A.A. could continue to limit payments to players that were not directly related to education.
“The courts are not a forum where you’re going to get relief,” said Don Yee, a sports lawyer and players-rights advocate.
For Yee, who also happens to be Tom Brady’s agent, the solution is “private entrepreneurialism.” He is planning a small professional football league that would field players not yet eligible for the N.F.L. (which generally requires players to be three years removed from high school). It would be developmental, like college football, but unlike college football, average pay would be $50,000.
A planned summer basketball league, the
Historical Basketball League
, would pay scholarships for its college-level players while enabling them to sell their names, images and likenesses to sponsors. The N.B.A.’s development league plans to offer higher salaries. The probable dissolution of the one-and-done rule in the next few years will again permit the most talented high school graduates to jump straight to the N.B.A. instead of having to spend at least a year in college.
A few states, notably North Carolina and California, have bills floating around that would allow athletes to be paid if, say, a video game uses their names and likenesses.
All these efforts are well intentioned. But if past is prologue, the system will not be successfully reformed in such patchwork fashion.
Nor is the college sports establishment likely to change its mind of its own volition.
At a news conference in Minneapolis last week, the N.C.A.A. president, Mark Emmert, said that he had sought to increase athlete participation in college sports’ governance.
“I’m a lifelong academic,” he said. “I grew up with that tradition, and I never worked at a school that didn’t have students on their board, and they were full voting board members. They voted on my contract, and I think that’s just perfectly appropriate.”
There are athletes serving on several important councils, but there is
not one
on the N.C.A.A. Board of Governors. No athletes vote on Emmert’s contract, which was extended late last year through 2023.
Tim Nevius, a onetime N.C.A.A. investigator whose experiences led him to turn on the system, believes the answer lies with player activism. Last month, he announced a new organization, the College Athlete Advocacy Initiative, that plans to pair his business representing athletes before the N.C.A.A. with trying to advocate for broader reform in coordination with players.
He acknowledged in an interview the challenges, including the relatively short time spans that college athletes actually are college athletes, as well as their current lack of formal bargaining power. But he insisted that player action was the surest avenue to change.
“There are powers here that the athletes have,” he said, “and we have to simply have them realize it and help them take the power into their own hands.”
Ros Gold-Unwude, a Turner Sports analyst and former Stanford basketball player, said last month that she expected to hear more from college athletes about how they felt about their position in the pecking order.
“That’s the way our culture is, where we all are telling our stories on social media platforms,” she said.
“If you’re really struggling or hungry,” she added, “that experience will come out.”
Apathy will come out as well, though. Beyond the structural obstacles to athletes deciding the system is unfair and determining to act to change it, a player could validly decide that he is happy receiving what he currently gets.
Napier, who is now a reserve on the Nets and who through a spokesman declined to comment for this article, said more during his “hungry nights” speech heard ’round the world, even though it received less publicity.
He noted that there were other wrongs. Players’ jerseys were sold to fans, and the players did not receive a cut. More basically, he said, the players were not paid.
It was, he suggested, wrong. Probably.
“Something can change, something should change,” Napier said five years ago. “But if it doesn’t, at the end of the day, we’ve been doing this for so long.”

MOSCOW — Russia's parliament on Thursday approved draft legislation that would impose fines of up to 50,000 rubles ($775) on athletes found to have used banned performance-enhancing drugs.
Russia has been rocked by several sporting bans in recent years after international investigations found evidence of widespread, state-sponsored doping in athletics and a string of other sports.
The amendments, which envisage fines of between 30,000 and 50,000 rubles for drug cheats, must still be approved by the upper chamber of parliament and signed by President Vladimir Putin before they become law.
Russian legislation already considers it a crime for coaches and medical staff to coerce athletes into doping, but there have so far not been any convictions under that law.
There is currently no law in Russia that punishes athletes themselves for doping.
The Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA and Russia's athletics federation were suspended after a 2015 report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russian athletics.
Russian authorities have denied state-sponsored doping but have accepted that senior officials were involved in providing banned substances to athletes, interfering with anti-doping procedures or covering up positive tests.
RUSADA was reinstated last year by WADA, angering sports bodies and athletes around the world. Russia's athletics federation remains suspended by the International Association of Athletics Federations, the sport's global governing body.
Despite the federation's suspension, some Russian athletes -- including twice world champion high jumper Maria Lasitskene and 2015 world champion hurdler Sergey Shubenkov -- have been cleared to compete internationally after demonstrating they are training in a doping-free environment.

MINNEAPOLIS — It is not Duke, North Carolina or UCLA.
Yet when sorting through all the games, personalities and events that helped shape college basketball into the billion-dollar colossus it is today, it's hard to look past the name ""Virginia.""
It's the program that gave us one of the sport's greatest players in Ralph Sampson, and its two biggest upsets, by Chaminade and the world's most famous No. 16 seed in the University of Maryland-Baltimore County. Virginia is now on the verge of writing a new chapter — one that arguably wouldn't be appreciated by nearly as many people were it not for the huge platform Virginia hoops helped create.
The Cavaliers play Texas Tech for the NCAA Tournament title Monday with a chance to add ""national champion"" to a resume already brimming with color and characters.
""University of Virginia holds a unique place in college basketball,"" said Craig Littlepage, the program's former longtime athletic director and one-time assistant basketball coach. ""Yes, there were some painful experiences. But if you look at them two years down the road, or 10 years, or 20 years, those things (were) good for the overall health of the game.""
Even in today's overhyped world of instant, nonstop sports analysis, Virginia's 77-72 loss on Dec. 23, 1982, to Chaminade of the NAIA remains among the handful of the very most shocking upsets in sports history.
The Cavaliers scheduled the game to keep the limbs loose on their way back from Tokyo, where they had played Hakeem Olajuwon, Clyde Drexler and Houston's Phi Slama Jama juggernaut as part of an early season tournament. Less than two weeks before that, it had been Virginia vs. Patrick Ewing and Georgetown in a meeting then billed as the Game of the Decade .
Virginia stood front-and-center in what college basketball was becoming in the early 1980s, a few years after Larry Bird and Magic Johnson set the stage with their epic meeting in the 1979 national final.
But that Chaminade game broke through the sports pages and onto to the front pages. Virginia was ranked No. 1 in the country and Sampson was the three-time national player of the year. Things like that simply weren't supposed to happen.
""It was one of those things that, for sure, had to have been a misprint or a miscommunication,"" Littlepage said.
It was not.
And in the hours — then days, months and years — that followed, the legend of that upset remains strong.
""We didn't really realize how big it was until the next day,"" Mark Rodrigues, the Chaminade point guard, told The Associated Press in a recent reminisce about the game. ""That's when AP was calling, everyone's sports department was calling, it was getting on CNN news, the local news and then you realize what really happened.""
Increasing popularity and more TV exposure helped spread the word about all the good programs out there, and the talent spread out with it.
Upsets became more common. Picking them became a pastime, as the NCAA Tournament bracket morphed into an office pool, and that turned into a small industry of its own.
Virginia was a bit player in — and two-time loser to — Jim Valvano's North Carolina State team during its miracle run through the 1983 tournament.
The year after Sampson left college, Virginia made the Final Four. That trip was a mere footnote in a 1980s hoops archive that included Villanova's shocker over Georgetown in the 1985 final and Danny Manning lifting Kansas to a similar upset over Oklahoma in 1988.
The NCAA Tournament expanded to 64 teams to start turning into the behemoth it is today — one that will soon command more than $1 billion a year in TV revenue from CBS and its partners.
Through all that, one unfulfilled occurrence remained the last bastion of ""Things That Will Never Happen"" in college hoops. In the 33-year history of the first-round matchups between 1 seeds and 16s, the 16 had never prevailed.
Then came Virginia. Again.
Its 74-54 loss last year to the Terriers of UMBC sent shockwaves across the country and reminded everyone, once again, of why they play these games.
""During last year's game, I had my phone on the table (on press row) and I started getting texts from old teammates,"" said Jim Miller, the Virginia forward who played with Sampson in the 1980s and was calling the UMBC loss on radio last year. ""They all said, 'Maybe they'll stop talking about Chaminade now.'""
More likely, they won't.
Miller says that even today, the two questions he's asked the most are: What was it like to play with Ralph Sampson? And, Were you on the team that lost to Chaminade?
And so, in his mind, the real legacy of Virginia basketball might be this: ""On any given night,"" he said, ""something like that can happen.""

The Arizona Diamondbacks' Adam Jones had a fan removed from San Diego's Petco Park during Wednesday night's game for spewing profane language, the outfielder told AZCentral.com.
Jones, who is from San Diego, said the fan was ""cussing me out"" while tracking down a fly ball in right field during the fifth inning of Arizona's 4-1 loss to the Padres.
""These fans in sports, man, they're starting to get a little more brazen,"" Jones told AZCentral. ""My biggest thing is, keep the banter polite - we suck, I struck out, the team's not good. Keep it light, keep it smart. ... But the second you start cussing me out like I'm a little kid, that's a no-no.
""On the street, they'd never do that. In the ballpark when you've paid your admission, there's no need for all that stuff. The second I hear somebody cussing us out, you're gone,"" Jones said. ""I made a nice play, and just hearing the B-word, F-word, that's not baseball talk. So ... he gone.""
Jones made national headlines in 2017 when, as a member of Baltimore Orioles, he claimed to be on the receiving end of racial taunts and having a bag of peanuts thrown on him at Fenway Park during a game in early May.
The incident resulted in an investigation and official apology from the Red Sox as well as condemnations from the Boston mayor and Massachusetts governor.

STOCKHOLM — The Swedish government is getting behind the country's bid to host the 2026 Winter Olympics.
Sports Minister Amanda Lind told broadcaster TV4 that hosting the games ""would be great for Sweden.""
Swedish Olympic Committee chief operating officer Peter Reinebo says taxpayers would not foot the bill for the games, which would be held in Sweden and Latvia. The committee has estimated it will cost 13.1 billion kronor ($1.4 billion) and has said no public funds will be used.
Last week, Latvian Prime Minister Arturs Krisjanis Karins pledged support for the 2026 bid. Most events would be held in Sweden — mainly in Are, Falun and in Stockholm — but luge would be in Sigulda, Latvia.
The IOC is scheduled to vote on the 2026 host in June. The other candidate is a combined Italian bid from Milan-Cortina d'Ampezzo.

(Reuters) - North Korea's Pyongyang marathon may be among the most complicated to enter but an easing of tensions on the Korean peninsula has made it a stage to highlight the power of sport amid growing interest for the race.
Athletes can only register through one operator, Koryo Tours, for a chance to run through the capital of the reclusive state in the Mangyongdae Prize International Marathon, as the race is officially known.
But close to 1,000 foreigners -- several hundred more than last year -- signed up in the sixth year foreign runners are allowed to compete on Sunday, according to officials, as tensions between North Korea and South Korea have eased since 2018.
Among those running were two Olympians -- retired Swiss freestyle skier Mirjam Jaeger and British snowboarder Aimee Fuller -- who are part of a documentary produced by the Olympic Channel on the Pyongyang marathon and the pair's experience of the local sports culture.
The Olympic Channel is a media operation of the International Olympic Committee and the documentary is set to air in September.
""The start (in Kim Il Sung Stadium) was very busy, the stadium completely full,"" Fuller, who took part in the 2014 and 2018 winter Olympics, told Reuters in a telephone interview from the North Korean capital.
""It felt as if we were on a world stage competition. That was completely surreal. It was like the Olympics in an Olympic stadium.""
Large crowds also lined the street at the start of this world athletics body IAAF-accredited bronze label road race with women wearing traditional costumes ready at refreshment stations.
""Around mile 13 it definitely started to thin out. Having that unique opportunity to move from Pyongyang out into the countryside was really surreal.""
Politics, however, is never too far away from the Pyongyang marathon, with visitors promised a tour of the capital's landmarks ""including a visit to the famous Victorious Fatherland Liberation War Museum and captured spy ship USS Pueblo."".
U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have met twice in the past year to discuss denuclearization while North and South Korea are planning for a joint Olympics bid in 2032.
Relations between the North and South greatly improved last year, with South Korean President Moon Jae-in meeting his North Korean counterpart Kim Jong Un at several summits.
North Korea had for years pursued nuclear and missile programs in defiance of U.N. sanctions but the neighbors moved to thaw relations in 2018.
""I would do it again. It was totally worth it,"" Jaeger, a 2014 Sochi Olympic participant, told Reuters.
""I met so many different people. I know it from my 12-year career as a skier. Sports really has no borders.""

TAMPA, Fla. — Notre Dame Coach Muffet McGraw has been on the Final Four stage nine times in her career. She has answered hundreds of questions about her team, about her rivalry with Connecticut’s Geno Auriemma, about the state of women’s basketball. But her news conference on Thursday was different. It was passionate, and it was personal.
Muffet McGraw has had enough.
Enough of the declining percentage of women coaching women’s basketball teams. Enough of the limited female representation in Congress. Enough of confining gender roles. Enough of the
gender pay gap
.
“Men run the world. Men have the power. Men make the decisions. It’s always the man that is the stronger one,” McGraw said, her voice rising in response to a question about saying in a recent ThinkProgress article that she
would not hire another man for her coaching staff
.
“When these girls are coming out, who are they looking up to to tell them that’s not the way it has to be?” McGraw continued. “Where better to do that than in sports? All these millions of girls that play sports across the country, we’re teaching them great things about life skills, but wouldn’t it be great if we could teach them to watch how women lead?”
In 1972, when the gender equity law known as Title IX was enacted, women were head coaches of more than 90 percent of the women’s college teams across two dozen sports. The percentage has decreased to about 40 now. The numbers are slightly better for women’s basketball, the most visible collegiate sport for women; about 59 percent of women’s college basketball teams were coached by women last year compared with 79 percent in 1977.
Though the issue is not new, it has been especially prominent on the sport’s biggest stage this week. Tennessee has not been to a Final Four since 2008, but the program’s coaching vacancy has been widely discussed.
Pat Summitt coached Tennessee for decades, building the program into a perennial powerhouse and making herself a leading figure in the sport. Holly Warlick, Summitt’s longtime assistant, took over when Summit left in 2012 because of early onset dementia. Warlick was fired last week, and Tennessee is conducting its first search for a women’s basketball coach in 45 years.
When Louisville Coach Jeff Walz was mentioned as a candidate, a loud debate about the ramifications of that decision ensued. Would Tennessee hire a man to run the House that Pat Built? And should it matter if the coach is a man or a woman, as long as they’re qualified?
McGraw said — loudly, pointedly — that it definitely matters.
“When you look at men’s basketball, 99 percent of the jobs go to men, why shouldn’t 100 or 99 percent of the jobs in women’s basketball go to women?” she said. “Maybe it’s because we only have 10 percent women athletic directors in Division I. People hire people who look like them. That’s the problem.”
McGraw’s comments also addressed topics like the failed Equal Rights Amendment and female representation in politics.
“I’m getting tired of the novelty of the first female governor of this state, the first female African-American mayor of this city. When is it going to become the norm instead of the exception?” she said, adding: “We don’t have enough female role models. We don’t have enough visible women leaders. We don’t have enough women in power.”
Notre Dame, the defending national champion, will meet UConn in a national semifinal on Friday night, the latest chapter in an intense rivalry that has played out on the court and in the news media for more than a decade. The assistants for both teams are all women.
Aware of McGraw’s vow not to hire another man, Auriemma pulled no punches when he responded this week.
“I hope she sends a thank you to all those guys that used to be on her staff that got her all those good players that won a championship,” he said.
Auriemma’s leading recruiter for 34 seasons has been the associate head coach, Chris Dailey. While building teams that won 11 N.C.A.A. titles at Connecticut, Dailey has been offered countless head coaching jobs, but she stayed to sustain the Huskies’ success.
“Women can be empowered by a lot of people, men included,” Dailey said after McGraw spoke on Thursday. “Opportunity for women is important, and it’s being brought to the forefront, which is amazing. But I do think you want good people in the game without excluding anyone.”
Auriemma has long been an advocate for women in the sport, but he disagreed with the idea of limiting opportunities for men.
“I just come at it from a different standpoint,” he said Thursday. “I just like to think that there’s probably a way to do one without the expense of another.”
He pointed to Oregon Coach Kelly Graves, the other man coaching in the Final Four this weekend. “So they weren’t trying to advance women’s basketball or women by hiring Kelly? That was a bad move? They should have just found the best available woman?”

Canadian children age 12 and younger will no longer be able to play the fullest version of tackle football starting in 2022. The restriction was devised by Football Canada, the sanctioning body for youth football in the country, as the latest in a series of steps to protect players from concussions and potential long-term cognitive problems.
Randy Ambrosie, the commissioner of the Canadian Football League, which works closely with Football Canada, announced the change Wednesday in Ottawa at a parliamentary hearing on concussions and sports.
“While we enthusiastically support tackle football for older age groups, we are putting a huge emphasis on flag football for young girls and boys,” Ambrosie said.
Football Canada has a number of categories for the versions of tackle football children can play and when they can do so. Already, children 8 or younger are not allowed to play tackle football. Children 10 and younger are allowed to play only six-on-six tackle football, or non-contact versions of the game, like flag football.
The new rule for will prohibit children 12 and under from playing 12-on-12 football, the version of the game used in Canadian colleges and in professional leagues. Children from 10 to 12 years old will still be able to play six-on-six tackle football and nine-on-nine, as well as non-contact football.
Some research has shown that
people who started playing tackle football before age 12
were at greater risk of developing cognitive problems later in life, compared with those who started playing tackle football after age 12.
In some ways, Canada has taken more steps to protect its players than the United States has. In 2017, for instance, the Canadian Football League
barred players
from deliberately slamming into one another during regular-season practices, and while they still wear helmets, they
no longer wear shoulder pads and other protective gear
in practices.
The N.F.L. has reduced, but not eliminated, full-contact practices during the season. The
Ivy League is the only United States college conference
to have ended full-contact football practices in the regular season.
The C.F.L. also added a third bye week to its 18-game calendar so there would be more time between games for players to recover.
Ambrosie, who played nine seasons in the C.F.L. and became commissioner of the league in 2017, has accelerated the introduction of safety measures partly to ward off potential lawsuits, but also to restore confidence in the sport, which has been losing players faster than in the United States.
The number of children in Canada playing tackle or non-contact forms of football has plummeted since 2010, to 100,000 from 170,000, according to government surveys and research by the C.F.L.
“Support for football in this country is underwhelming and disappointing,”
Ambrosie told lawmakers
in the House of Commons Subcommittee on Sports-Related Concussions. “At times it can feel like it’s under attack.”

LONDON — England football manager Gareth Southgate received the OBE award at Buckingham Palace on Thursday after steering the national team to the World Cup semi-finals in Russia last Summer.
Southgate, 48, dressed in his trademark waistcoat, was presented the award for services to football by Prince Charles after he was included in Queen Elizabeth's 2019 New Year's honours list.
""It's very special,"" he told Sky Sports TV after the ceremony. ""It's a privilege to be the English manager and to receive an award from the royal family - as a proud royal fan, that was very special. It's a moment that will live with me for ever.""
Last month, team captain Harry Kane received the MBE award. He was top scorer with six goals in Russia but the team was knocked out after a 2-1 loss to Croatia in the semi-finals.
Southgate's OBE came as England climbed one place to fourth in FIFA's latest world rankings after Euro 2020 qualifying victories over the Czech Republic and Montenegro.

NEW YORK — Baseball's 2026 All-Star Game will be played in Philadelphia to mark the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, a person familiar with the planning told The Associated Press.
The person spoke on condition of anonymity Thursday because no announcement had been made.
A news conference is scheduled for Tuesday with Independence Hall as a backdrop and is to include Commissioner Rob Manfred, Phillies owner John Middleton, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf and Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney.
This will be the first All-Star Game at Citizens Bank Park, which opened in 2004. The 1976 All-Star Game was played at Veterans Stadium to mark the 200th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, and the 1996 All-Star Game also was played at the Vet, which stood in the same sports complex in South Philadelphia. The 1943 and 1952 games were at Shibe Park.
This year's All-Star Game is July 9 at Cleveland's Progressive Field, which also hosted the All-Stars in 1997, when the ballpark was known as Jacobs Field. The 2020 game will be at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, site of the 1980 game. Sites for 2021-25 have not been announced.
Lincoln Financial Field, adjacent to Citizens Bank Park, is among the venues under consideration to hold matches during soccer's World Cup in June and July 2026.

Former New York Mets outfielder Lenny Dykstra has sued ex-teammate Ron Darling, alleging defamation over comments Darling made about him in his new book.
TMZ Sports reported Tuesday that the lawsuit was filed in New York. Dykstra wants Darling to pay damages for ""defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress.""
Dykstra, 56, also wants a judicial injunction to keep further copies of the book from being sold.
Darling has stood by an allegation he made in his book that Dykstra shouted racial slurs at Boston Red Sox pitcher Dennis ""Oil Can"" Boyd in the 1986 World Series.
""I heard what I heard and I put it in the book for a reason,"" Darling said last week's on ESPN's ""Golic and Wingo,"" referring to his new book titled, ""108 Stitches: Loose Threads, Ripping Yarns, and the Darndest Characters from My Time in the Game.""
In the book, released last week, Darling wrote that Dykstra was ""shouting every imaginable and unimaginable insult and expletive in his (Boyd's) direction -- foul, racist, hateful, hurtful stuff"" while in the on-deck circle. Further, Darling wrote that the insults were ""worse than anything Jackie Robinson might have heard.""

(Reuters) - Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe is unsure if Ryan Fraser will be at the Premier League club next season with the Scottish winger linked with a transfer to Arsenal in the close season.
Fraser, whose contract ends in June next year, told Sky Sports on Friday that he was flattered to be linked with a ""massive club"" such as Arsenal after British media reported manager Unai Emery was interested in securing his services.
""We have spoken to Ryan and his representatives about his contract. It's one where we will see what happens,"" Howe told reporters on Friday.
""There is no doubting Ryan's quality and how highly we think of him. He is an outstanding talent but it is a two-way prospect to sign a contract, so let's wait and see.""
Fraser, 25, has been one of Bournemouth's key players this season with six goals and 10 assists in the league.
""Ryan has contributed to the team this season but it's not the time to talk about speculation,"" Howe added. ""Who knows in the summer? It's that time of year when things change and us ourselves will be looking to sign players.""
Bournemouth, who are 12th in the league standings, host Burnley later on Saturday.

BERLIN — Borussia Moenchengladbach have appointed Marco Rose as their head coach for next season, the club said on Wednesday, after they agreed last week to part ways with current coach Dieter Hecking at the end of the current season.
The 42-year-old led RB Salzburg to the Austrian title last year in his first season in charge of the senior team while also reaching the Europa League semi-finals and the Austrian Cup final. He has also been coaching their junior teams since joining in 2013.
""Marco Rose did outstanding work in the past six years at RB Salzburg and we are delighted that he will be with us from next season,"" said Gladbach sports director Max Eberl.
Rose had a contract until 2020 at Salzburg, and Gladbach have reportedly paid a fee of 2.5 million euros (2.15 million pounds) to sign him away from the Austrian club. There were no details regarding the length of the deal.
Gladbach said last week that Hecking would be leaving at the end of the season, a year before his contract finishes.
Gladbach enjoyed a fine first half to the season but have since dropped to fifth in the league and won only one of their last eight matches. Hecking has been in charge since 2016.

TOULOUSE, France — Former France coach Guy Noves is entitled to one million euros (£862,415) in compensation for wrongful dismissal by the national rugby federation, a French court said on Monday.
The FFR alleged Noves was guilty of serious misconduct, but a Toulouse labour tribunal decided otherwise. Noves was asking for 2.88 million euros.
Both parties have the right to appeal, although initial reactions suggested that they had accepted the outcome.
""I am satisfied with this decision. The FFR said there was serious misconduct and the tribunal said there was none,"" Noves, the first France rugby union coach to be sacked, told reporters.
""I don't know if we are going to appeal, we have a month to do so. The demands (from Noves) were excessive and the decision is reasonable,"" the FFR's lawyer Joseph Aguera told French sports newspaper L'Equipe.
The FFR later welcomed a ""balanced"" decision and said in a statement it did not plan to appeal.
Noves was sacked by the FFR in December 2017 after winning seven of his 21 matches in charge, while his contract was due to run until the end of this year's World Cup in Japan.
Noves, 65, was replaced by Jacques Brunel, who has been struggling to turn the situation around.
France beat Scotland and Italy in this year's Six Nations but lost against England, Ireland and Wales to finish fourth.

""I'm proud to become a member of the Nike family and excited about getting involved in all of the opportunities Nike has to offer,"" said Osaka in the statement.
""Nike has a legendary track record of writing history and I look forward to being a part of those moments for many years to come.""
The Japanese has won the last two Grand Slams, having become the first ever Japanese player to win one of the four majors when she overcame Serena Williams at the U.S. Open in September.
""Naomi is an incredible talent to add to our roster and help drive our commitment to inspiring a new generation of female athletes,"" Nike VP Amy Montagne added in the statement.
""We are thrilled to have her join our team.""
Osaka's ascent to the top of the women's game has made her a hot marketable commodity for the world's top brands.
She already has deals with Japanese airline All Nippon Airways, car manufacturer Nissan and watch company Citizen, amongst others.

OR YEHUDA, Israel — Darting between the goal posts with his striking white hair, 73-year-old Israeli Isaak Hayik set a new world record on Friday as the oldest person to play in a professional soccer match.
Hayik, who celebrates his 74th birthday next week, broke the record after playing as a goalkeeper in an afternoon game with Israel's Ironi Or Yehuda soccer club.
The Iraqi-born keeper was officially recognized in an award ceremony attended by representatives from the Guinness World Record organization.
""I'm ready for another game,"" said Hayik, who made some good saves in the team's 5-1 defeat to Maccabi Ramat Gan.
""This is not only a source of pride for me but also to Israeli sports in general,"" added Hayik, who moved to Israel when he was four years old.
The previous record was held by Robert Carmona of Uruguay, who in 2015 played a professional match with Uruguay's Pan de Azucar at the age of 53, an official adjudicator for Guinness World Records said.
Hayik's family were among the tens of thousands of Iraqi Jews who fled to Israel in the mid-20th century, following the country's creation in 1948.
His children spoke of their pride in their father's achievement. One of his sons said he and his father used to play together.
""I used to get tired before he did,"" Moshe Hayik, 36, said. ""He is unbelievable.""

In two weeks, the N.C.A.A.’s primary legislative body, the Division I Council, will vote on a measure that could severely restrict graduate transfers.
By
Billy Witz
MINNEAPOLIS — When Matt Mooney was refurbishing used basketball shoes and selling them out of the trunk of his car in high school, that entrepreneurial streak looked as if it would carry him further than basketball. At the time, he had only one Division I scholarship offer.
When Tariq Owens was at a renowned prep school, as a bouncy, loose-limbed, four-star recruit, an N.B.A. career seemed less like a pipe dream than a reasonable career path. College would serve as finishing school.
But several years (and universities) later, there they were last weekend in Anaheim, Calif., with fists clenched and arms raised triumphantly overhead, as unlikely teammates — and improbable one-season catalysts — in helping Texas Tech reach the Final Four for the first time.
Mooney and Owens arrived at Texas Tech less than a year ago as a less heralded type of one-and-done player, having taken advantage of the N.C.A.A.’s graduate transfer rule, which allows athletes who have earned a degree and have eligibility remaining to switch colleges without having to sit out a year.
The graduate transfer rule, the rare N.C.A.A. regulation that gives leverage to the athlete, has been used by hundreds of players since it was relaxed in 2011. And at a moment when athletic admission graft, shoe company payola and questions about whether a transcendent (and unpaid) figure like Zion Williamson should even risk playing college basketball at all, the graduate transfer rule casts the beleaguered N.C.A.A. as reasonable and almost munificent.
It is also a rule that may not last much longer.
In two weeks, the N.C.A.A.’s primary legislative body, the Division I Council, will vote on a measure that could severely restrict graduate transfers. The proposed rule change would require that colleges accepting graduate transfers be docked a scholarship the next year if the transfer does not earn his secondary degree within a year.
So as graduate transfers have continued to increase — there were 124 this season in men’s basketball, according to the website
GradTransferTracker
, including a handful who were key contributors on N.C.A.A. tournament teams — and as programs have found value in them as a quick fix that suits both team and player, the new rule is seeking to discourage them by effectively adding a tax on programs that accept such players.
“That’s really draconian,” Rodney Fort, a sports economist and professor of sports management at the University of Michigan, said of the rule change. “This is like losing a scholarship from an N.C.A.A. penalty.”
The proposal, which could go into effect as soon as Aug. 1, would apply to only three sports — football, women’s basketball and men’s basketball — but appears particularly aimed at men’s basketball. Football teams, with 85 scholarships, are far more capable of coping with the loss of a single scholarship than a men’s basketball squad, which has 13. And there are roughly twice as many graduate transfers each year in men’s basketball as in women’s basketball.
Justin Sell, the athletic director at South Dakota State who led the Division I transfer working group that developed the proposal, said that too often graduate transfers in men’s basketball and football had little interest in obtaining graduate degrees.
“We really want to protect against the football player who is done and leaves in December and the basketball player who is done and leaves in March,” Sell said. “A lot of students are looking to use it to play another year. Who’s seriously there for the master’s?”
Sell said that the committee surveyed athletic directors, faculty representatives, senior woman administrators, coaches and athletes over 18 months. Still, the fingerprints of basketball coaches in the working group’s recommendation were not hard to miss. The lone men’s basketball voice on the committee was St. Joseph’s Coach Phil Martelli, who in a widely publicized 2011 case
blocked one of his graduating players from transferring
by refusing to sign a release. Partially as a result of that case, releases are no longer required. (Martelli, who was fired by St. Joseph’s last month, declined to comment through a university spokesman.)
The rule itself seems to have come straight from the mouth of Kentucky Coach John Calipari, who suggested to ESPN in 2016 — long before the committee began its work — that “if the kid gets his grad degree in one year, fine; if he doesn’t, you’ve got to use the scholarship for two years.”
Sell conceded objections about practicality (many graduate programs take two years to complete) and fairness (the rule does not apply to athletes who compete as graduate students without transferring) were fair, but said his group’s intent was to “manage behavior.”
“When you’re trying to manage behavior and put together policies and rules in trying to create ethical behavior and integrity, there are challenges to that,” Sell said. “It’s really hard to police integrity.”
But the rule change leaves no room to assess the motivations of players who, degrees in hand, seek new horizons with their remaining eligibility. The Ivy League, for example,
does not allow its teams
to play graduate students; that led the former Yale guard Makai Mason — who had missed his junior season with a broken foot —
to help Baylor
to the N.C.A.A. tournament this spring. The rule also gave the former Stanford player Reid Travis the opening he needed to take his N.B.A. hopes, and his final year of eligibility,
to Kentucky
for some postgraduate basketball education.
Geno Crandall, who had begun his college career at North Dakota, ended it as a reserve guard at Gonzaga this spring.
“I kind of wanted a different experience,” said Crandall, who said he had sought out Mooney, whom he had met when Mooney was at South Dakota, for advice on the transfer process. Crandall is working toward a master’s degree in organizational leadership at Gonzaga but said he took a lighter course load, two classes per semester, so that he could focus on basketball.
“Honestly, I’m actually enjoying it a lot more than I did undergrad,” Crandall said before the Zags lost to Mooney’s Red Raiders in the West Region final last weekend. “There’s a lot more discussion that goes into it, a lot more adult feel. This is more tailored to what you find interesting.”
Gonzaga’s Crandall said he was only vaguely aware of the proposed restrictions on graduate transfers. But he did not like the idea that a rule change might deny future players the path he had chosen.
“Whether it’s good or bad, the N.C.A.A. tries to take a lot of control away from players,” he said. “You commit to a school and they tell you they want you to play and help you get your degree, so I feel like once you get your degree your obligations are kind of fulfilled.”
Nearly 40 percent of Division I men’s basketball players who arrive from high school will transfer by the end of their sophomore year, according to N.C.A.A. data from 2011 to 2017. Owens and Mooney, now in the Final Four, were in that group.
Owens left Tennessee after his freshman year when its coach was fired. He transferred to St. John’s, where he earned a degree in sports management. Mooney left Air Force, unhappy with the military lifestyle, for South Dakota, where he got a degree in innovation and entrepreneurship. He was content to remain there for his final year until his coach, Craig Smith, left for Utah State last April.
With eligibility left because of their transfers, Owens and Mooney hit the graduate transfer market seeking the same thing — a place where they could win (neither had been to the N.C.A.A. tournament) and burnish their skills for a possible pro career. Texas Tech turned out to be a perfect match: a program on the rise with a respected coach, Chris Beard, and a roster that was a perfect fit for Owens, a 6-foot-10 shot-blocker and finisher, and Mooney, a ball-hawking point guard who could find his shot.
“This is an environment where I knew I’d be able to work and I’d be coached hard,” Owens said. “I like being in environments where you’ve got something to prove.”
At Texas Tech, Owens, 23, and Mooney, 24, are enrolled in a master’s program for interdisciplinary studies, taking three classes in the fall and spring that are tailored to their interests. Mooney is taking two of his classes online.
“My primary focus is basketball, to try to set myself up for the pros,” said Mooney, who is studying educational leadership. “Academics aren’t a huge priority right now, but you’ve still got to take care of it. I’ve got my degree — that’s what’s most important.”
He added: “I didn’t leave places because I wasn’t satisfied with playing time or things like that. I definitely didn’t want it to go this way. I didn’t want to go to three different schools. I wanted to go to one school, play there four years, have a great career and have a home to go back to and graduate. But sometimes life doesn’t work out that way.”
An earlier version of this article misidentified the university at which Geno Crandall began his college basketball career. It was North Dakota, not North Dakota State.

AUGUSTA, Ga. — Only when Nick Faldo took a break after playing nine holes Sunday at Augusta National did he look differently.
At least to Matt Wallace.
Faldo was asked to present prizes for the Drive, Chip and Putt National Finals, and he had to look the part. The three-time Masters champion headed upstairs to his locker, slipped on his green jacket and returned to the trophy presentation.
Wallace, making his Masters debut, rushed over to Faldo and rubbed the sleeve of his jacket with his fingers.
""I love it,"" Faldo said. ""I come here, open my locker, there's my jacket. I've got to tell you, it's pretty cool. It's a pretty special thing.""
It's what everyone wants a week from Sunday, perhaps the most significant piece of clothing awarded in sports. And the race for it is as open as ever against the smallest field of the four majors.
Tiger Woods is going for his first Masters title in 14 years. Rory McIlroy is going for his first, which would be the last leg of the career Grand Slam. The last seven Masters champions were among the top 25 in the world, and six players from the top 10 in the world arrive at Augusta National having already won this year.
Players began filtering in at Augusta National in the last few days even as they had to share the golf course. The inaugural Augusta National Women's Amateur was held the previous two days, with 72 players practicing on Friday and the 30 players who made the cut competing on Saturday.
On Sunday, parts of the practice facility, the putting green and the 18th green were occupied by kids ages 7 through 15 for the sixth Drive, Chip and Putt.
""With yesterday and today, the buzz is unbelievable,"" Adam Scott said. ""The kids are amazing, and it makes me feel like a kid again. As long as they're still finding it fun, these kinds of things are so good. Just wait — one day, a Drive, Chip and Putt champion will be a Masters champion.""
Unique about the Masters, among many things, is that it's the only major organized and hosted by a private club.
Members can play the course through Sunday, and they often do. Only past champions, like Scott and Mike Weir, are allowed to bring guests. Scott has been bringing his father, Phil, since winning in 2013.
Faldo, who won his first green jacket 30 years ago and now is the lead analyst for CBS Sports, couldn't think of a better place to be.
""There's nothing like this,"" he said. ""Sure, we're biased because we're in golf, but you tell me what sporting event is better than this, especially for a week? You'll get amazing matches at Wimbledon and all sorts of things. But this, for like 10 days, there's nothing, I don't think. You tell me what sporting event can top this.""
One veteran European writer suggested the Tour de France.
Faldo pointed to umbrella-covered lawn tables and chairs outside the clubhouse, where visitors sipped on lemonade across from the putting green and first tee.
""You don't have this ambiance,"" he said. ""Tour de France, you sit at a cafe and whoosh! There they go. And everyone says, 'Ooh-la-la!' And then what do you do?""
Nothing moves quickly at Augusta National except time.
Even as Sunday drew closer to the start of Masters week, so much of the chatter was on the Augusta National Women's Amateur, heralded as a wildly successful debut, especially with the way Wake Forest senior Jennifer Kupcho took on the par 5s and played the final six holes in 5 under to win.
Kupcho dreads going back to school next week. She was back on the course Sunday soaking up a win she considered bigger than her NCAA title last year, mainly because of the stage she was on and the effect on her sport.
""To get all the support that we've gotten from all the fans, all the press, it's unbelievable for the women's game,"" she said. ""It was just unreal. I definitely had nerves, butterflies. And there's no words to describe it. It was just a great round, and it's probably the most fun I've ever had on a golf course.""
By day's end, as no more than five players were on the range in late afternoon with no one around, the Masters started coming into view.
""Rory wins, it's the Grand Slam,"" Faldo said. ""If Tiger wins, my goodness, what's that going to be? It might make the morning papers for three months.""

LAS VEGAS — Don Logan spent years trying to get a new minor league ballpark in this gambling city, so the president of the Las Vegas Aviators understands what the Oakland A's are going through in their quest for new digs in the Bay Area.
After all, he's had sewage in his dugout, too.
The A's are still contending with antiquated plumbing at the Oakland Coliseum, the team's home for the past 51 years. Their efforts to get a new stadium have floundered over the years, though recently there has been some momentum toward a new home field.
The club's top minor league team? Well, that's another story.
The Triple-A Aviators open at home Tuesday night in what might be the best ballpark in all of minor league baseball, a $150 million palace complete with swimming pool in right center, celebrity chefs overseeing the grills, and player comforts that rival the bigs.
If players have to spend time in Las Vegas on their way to the top, at least they'll be doing it in style.
""I think I can promise you the locker room facilities just by themselves are far superior here than in Oakland,"" Logan said.
Funded in part by an $80 million naming rights deal with Las Vegas tourism officials, the appropriately named Las Vegas Ballpark is a big investment for minor league baseball. The 10,000-seat ballpark replaces Cashman Field, which opened in 1983 and — in a bit of serendipity — was briefly the home of the A's themselves when they had to play their first six games of the 1996 season in Las Vegas because the Coliseum was being remodeled for the Raiders.
Logan was there for that series, as he has been for almost every game at Cashman since arriving in 1984, the year after what was then the Padres Triple-A team began play in Las Vegas. He was instrumental in trying to land four spring training teams for the city in the 1990s, and is in the conversation whenever talk turns to a possible major league franchise in Sin City.
But while he has seen just about everything in minor league baseball, Logan says he has never seen a ballpark like the one his team opens in this week.
""This is going to be as nice as any ballpark in the country,"" Logan said. ""There isn't anything we haven't thought of.""
That includes the pool, a concept first introduced by the Arizona Diamondbacks, which will be especially popular on summer nights when the temperature doesn't drop below 100 degrees until the games are over. Set amid a forest of towering palm trees, it rents for around $2,000 a game, and Logan predicted it will be filled almost every night.
So will the seats — which are made of mesh to help with the desert heat — and the party decks, which are modeled after those at the minor league park in Charlotte, North Carolina. Fans enjoying the game on the left field party deck will get the bonus of a view of the glittering hotels of the Las Vegas Strip in the valley below.
Logan, the 2018 Pacific Coast League executive of the year, said the team and its architects also borrowed from design elements from ballparks in El Paso, Texas, and in Columbus, Ohio, which has been the top-ranked minor league ballpark in many surveys.
""Its reign as the top ballpark in the minors is about to end this season,"" Logan said. ""It is cool, but it's not this cool.""
The old ballpark was located in a declining neighborhood near downtown, while the new one is in the suburban master planned community of Summerlin, with the new practice facility for the NHL's Vegas Golden Knights reachable with a big shot over the left field scoreboard.
It's prime real estate and players will also like that they can walk to the clubhouse from the Red Rock hotel-casino across the street, where visiting teams will stay. Fans can also bet on the game at the casino's sports book, which is offering lines on all Aviators games.
Ticket buyers will find it just as inviting. Besides the swimming pool, there are 22 suites, a wall full of craft beer taps, and a club level complete with a show kitchen for cooking displays. Giada de Laurentiis is one of the celebrity chefs, with others to come. The team also has its own beer, a seasonal ale.
""We've spent an inordinate amount of time on food and different types of beers,"" Logan said. ""The food options and food experience here will be better than most anywhere in baseball, if not better.""
Looming over it all will be a $4 million video board that is the largest in the minor leagues. This is Las Vegas, after all, so there has to be some glitz especially considering the city also has a new arena for the Golden Knights and is building a $1.9 billion stadium for the Raiders that will open next year.
That's a lot of competition for the sports dollar, but the Aviators figure to find their niche on the minor league level.
Big league good, even without a big league team.

BERLIN — Former German Football Association (DFB) president Reinhard Grindel on Wednesday announced his resignation from the world and European soccer bodies, FIFA and UEFA, after leaving the DFB last week over an expensive gift.
Grindel had had to apologise for accepting an expensive watch from a Ukrainian colleague as a gift, and said he had not known its value.
Now he said he was also leaving his UEFA Vice Presidency and his seat on the FIFA Executive Council.
""I am mainly interested in protecting the good name of UEFA,"" he said in a statement. I also do not want to burden FIFA on its path to more transparency and good governance.""
Grindel, who took over the world's biggest sports federation by membership in 2016, had come under pressure over income he received from a DFB subsidiary and a watch he had been given by Ukrainian businessman and soccer administrator Grigory Surkis.
While denying any wrongdoing, Grindel said last week he had been unaware that the watch was worth 6,000 euros (5,168.9 pounds).
On Wednesday he again said he had done nothing wrong and that there had been no conflict of interest.
During his time as DFB chief, Grindel was criticised for his handling of the case of German national player Mesut Ozil, who had his photograph taken alongside Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan prior to last year's World Cup.
Ozil retired from the national team after Germany's shock first round exit and said he had faced ""racism and disrespect"" because of his Turkish roots.
Grindel criticised Germany coach Joachim Loew last month after he dropped Mats Hummels, Jerome Boateng and Thomas Mueller from the national team, before rowing back on his comments.

MOSCOW — Russia plans to fine athletes who get caught doping, though the scheme may not be much of a deterrent for the country's top performers.
The Russian parliament voted Thursday to impose a maximum fine of 50,000 rubles ($775) for any athlete caught taking banned substances.
Russia has been embroiled in doping scandals for years, including allegations of a mass cover-up by the host nation at the 2014 Sochi Olympics.
Previously, only those who helped others could be fined for doping, though that legislation has been used rarely, if at all.
Under the new rule, only athletes deemed to have intentionally cheated would be subject to fines.
""Breaking anti-doping rules does not only contradict the principles of honesty and humanism, but in fact also is a kind of fraud,"" Pavel Krashennikov, a lawmaker who backed the measure, said in a statement.
While most countries treat doping as a civil matter, people caught using performance-enhancing drugs in some countries face potential jail sentences if they are deemed to have won prize money by deceit. Austrian police arrested five skiers at the Nordic world championships in February in a blood-doping case which has since spread to cycling and other sports.
International anti-doping watchdogs haven't always welcomed the involvement of Russian law enforcement. An ongoing Russian investigation into doping and malpractice at the Moscow anti-doping laboratory has sealed off many stored samples that the World Anti-Doping Agency wants to test.
The Russian investigation in that case has also argued that Russian athletes didn't use performance-enhancing drugs at the 2014 Olympics, as WADA maintains, and that WADA's star witness was in fact coercing otherwise clean athletes to use drugs.
Russia's team was barred from last year's Winter Games in Pyeongchang for repeated doping violations, but 168 competitors from the country were allowed to compete as ""Olympic Athletes from Russia.""
Of those, two were later disqualified for doping, more than any other country.

SYDNEY — David Warner will be driven to prove his worth to Australia when he returns to the side but will need to check his ego at the door as he is no longer an indispensable part of the team, former South African captain Graeme Smith has said.
The 32-year-old received a 12-month ban from international cricket in March last year for his role in a ball-tampering scandal in South Africa.
Warner, who has notched up 349 runs and scored one century and three half centuries in six matches for the Indian Premier League's Sunrisers Hyderabad, is set to be named in Australia's squad for the May 30-July 14 Cricket World Cup in England.
""I think at the moment he needs Australian cricket more than they need him,"" Smith told Australian television show The Back Page on Fox Sports.
""He's very driven, I think he wants to do well, he wants to prove his worth again and I think David Warner in that position is probably a good guy to have in your environment.
""It's when he starts to get bigger than everybody else that probably management needs to be ready for (that).
""Guys like (coach Justin) Langer and whoever is captaining the side going forward need to ensure they stay on top of that and manage that space and that ego well going forward.""
Warner, identified as the main instigator in the ball-tampering scandal, has also been a lightning rod for criticism for his aggressive behaviour on the field, especially in his sledging of opponents.
He was captured on closed-circuit television confronting South Africa's Quinton de Kock as they walked off the field during a test in Durban after the wicketkeeper responded to a barrage of personal abuse during the day.
""He's always been an incredible cricketer,"" said Smith. ""He bats with that driven nature, that intensity, ego to perform.""
Aside from his batting expertise, however, Warner also had a talent for rubbing people up the wrong way, he added.
""He's just that type of guy.""

BALTIMORE — Baltimore first baseman Chris Davis is nearing a record streak for futility.
Davis was 0 for 4 with two strikeouts in Sunday's 15-3 loss to the New York Yankees. He is 0 for 23 with 13 strikeouts this season and is hitless in 44 at-bats since a second-inning double off James Shields of the Chicago White Sox last Sept. 14.
Davis two shy of the record for consecutive hitless at-bats by a position player, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Los Angeles Dodgers infielder Eugenio Velez went hitless in his final 46 at-bats of the 2011 season, one more than the previous mark shared by Pittsburgh's Bill Bergen (1909), Dave Campbell of San Diego and St. Louis (1973) and Milwaukee's Craig Counsell (earlier in 2011).
Orioles manager Brandon Hyde has tried to stay positive with Davis, who has two RBIs, on a bases-loaded walk and a forceout. Most of the Orioles lineup struggled Sunday against Yankees left-hander Domingo German, who gave up two runs, two hits and two walks over six-plus innings.
""I haven't talked to him about it since, but he's facing a tough lefty there,"" Hyde said. ""I hope that he feels like he's making progress. He took a couple decent passes on those fly balls. Just didn't happen.""
Davis is in the fourth season of a $161 million, seven-year contract.
He hit .168 last year, the worst batting average in major league history for a qualified player, with 16 home runs, 49 RBIs and a .539 OPS.
Davis has been booed after strikeouts at Camden Yards.
""I understand the frustration,"" Davis said after Thursday's home opener. ""Nobody's more frustrated than I am, especially a day like today, the kind of game that we were having. It was a frustrating day for me personally and the team collectively. But you've got to move on.""

AUGUSTA, Ga. — Keith Mitchell has attended the Masters four or five times, and he has played Augusta National five times through friends, his time playing at Georgia or a practice round when he qualified by winning the Honda Classic.
None of that prepared him for Monday.
""I was nervous just simply walking across the range,"" Mitchell said. ""And then I started hitting some putts and some balls, and I started feeling better. But this place is just magical for anyone and everyone.""
Mitchell is among 17 players making their Masters debut this week, which includes the six amateurs. Every one has watched it on TV and has dreamed of playing. Perhaps it was actually attending the tournament that made it different for Mitchell.
""I've seen that range from the other side of the ropes before, and I've always watched people and admired how they hit the shots and hit their wedges and the shapes of the drivers,"" he said. ""And then I was the guy that people were watching. I think it's just kind of neat seeing it from the other side.""
But that begs the question: Were they actually watching him?
""No,"" Mitchell said with a laugh before adding: ""I felt they were. I wanted them to.""
His goal this week is to feel like he belongs, which is more about shedding the awe. Mitchell already has taken his place in golf by beating Brooks Koepka and Rickie Fowler with a birdie on the last hole to win the Honda Classic.
""I still kind of feel like a rookie and still feel just kind of in awe of the place, and I hope that never goes away,"" he said. ""But at the same time, I want to be more comfortable inside the ropes out here. That's tough, because only experience and time can change that. ... Everybody is saying, 'Enjoy your first trip, soak it in, have fun.' I'm trying. But I'm also playing in one of the biggest tournaments in the world, and you want to play well.""
READY RICKIE
Rickie Fowler knows he can play well on the weekend with a major championship on the line. What is still missing is a celebration after the final shot.
Fowler returns to Augusta National brimming with confidence after shooting 65 and 67 over the last two rounds of the 2018 Masters.
Unfortunately, it wasn't quite enough to overtake Patrick Reed, who held on for a one-stroke victory and his first major title.
""Just have to do one better,"" Fowler said Monday.
At age 30, he is eager to break through with his first championship in one of golf's signature events. Though he has also had runner-up finishes in the U.S. Open and British Open, as well as a tie for third at the PGA Championship, Fowler believes Augusta might be his chance for major No. 1.
""I love this place just because of how much it allows you to use your imagination,"" he said. ""I can putt well around here. I love putting these greens.""
Fowler was asked if he had any regrets about last year's close call.
""I left it all there,"" he replied. ""It would have been nice if there was one more hole, when it was all said and done, but no, I hit the shots that I wanted to.""
MASTERS STATS
Mark Broadie, the Columbia professor behind the ""strokes gained"" statistics on the PGA Tour that rank players compared with the rest of the field, produced some analyses about the Masters that confirm it's a test unlike any other.
In an article for golf.com, Broadie writes that players make 2% more of their 6-foot putts at Augusta National — a high figure — compared with typical PGA Tour events, mainly because the greens are so manicured that they roll true.
""Players sink more putts inside 10 feet at Augusta than anywhere else,"" he wrote.
However, Broadie said over the last four years Augusta National has the highest three-putt rate of any PGA Tour event — 5.4%, compared with the average PGA Tour rate of 3 percent.
He also looked at proximity to the hole on shots from 125 to 200 yards. Augusta National ranked No. 1 in difficult, with players averaging 31 feet from the hole, compared with 26 feet as the PGA Tour average.
""Put another way,"" Broadie writes, ""Masters competitors leave shots as close to the pin from 150 yards as players do on all other Tour venues from 170 yards.""
AMATEUR HOUR
NBC Sports says it received a .96 overnight rating for its coverage from noon to 3 p.m. Saturday of the inaugural Augusta National Women's Amateur, where Jennifer Kupcho played her final six holes in 5-under par to win.
It was the highest-rated amateur golf telecast — men or women — in 16 years, dating to the 2003 U.S. Amateur championship match that got a 1.36 overnight rating.
The tournament began with a GOLF Films short titled, ""When I Grow Up, I Want To ...,"" which the network says has nearly 1 million views on social media.

NEW YORK — The NBA 2K League, a professional esports league for players of the basketball video game, said on Tuesday that YouTube will stream live broadcasts of all its games this season.
The coverage includes the league's more than 230 regular-season, playoff and finals games. Games take place at the league's studio in the New York City borough of Queens.
The agreement allows YouTube, a unit of Alphabet Inc, to broaden its already huge array of esports content.
It comes at a time of exploding interest in esports, when professional video game players compete against each other, often for prize pools before thousands of fans watching online and in arenas.
The NBA 2K League is ""one of the very few leagues that we were not streaming on YouTube already,"" Ryan Wyatt, YouTube's global head of gaming, told Reuters.
The platform already distributes content from more than two dozen other leagues.
It said it has 200 million users who watch gaming content every day globally. In 2018, users watched more than 50 billion hours of gaming content.
YouTube's overall gaming strategy is to bring scores of esports leagues and organizations onto its platform in non-exclusive distribution agreements.
Wyatt wants to see esports ""on as many platforms as possible, because it's an opportunity... for this space to continue to grow,"" he said. ""We have no desire for exclusivity right now. We want to celebrate the category and grow it.""
The 21-team NBA 2K League's second season began April 2 and concludes in August. The NBA itself was the first professional sports league to partner with YouTube in 2005, when it launched its own channel.
The NBA and YouTube would not disclose financial terms of the agreement.
The deal does not currently have an end date because it is ""more about just getting them ramped up on our platform,"" Wyatt said.
Fans can also still continue to watch live NBA 2K games on Twitch, a unit of Amazon.com Inc, which previously had the exclusive rights to air the league's games.

LONDON — Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley is still looking for ways to take control of Debenhams, he said on Monday after the ailing retailer rejected his rescue plan only hours before it was due to fall into the hands of its lenders.
Billionaire Ashley, who has compiled a string of stakes in retailers after building up Sports Direct, had offered to underwrite a 150 million pound ($196 million) rights issue in exchange for the Debenhams CEO role and a pledge by lenders to write off a similar amount of debt.
Debenhams, once the country's biggest chain of department stores, rejected the offer on Monday afternoon.
Sports Direct has also offered to buy Debenhams outright, but the strained relations between the two sides make it more likely that Debenhams will enter a form of administration on Tuesday that would wipe out all shareholders.
""In the continued absence of any such engagement from the board of Debenhams and Debenhams' lenders, there is a likely significant and negative impact on Debenhams' current shareholders and other stakeholders, including suppliers and employees,"" Sports Direct said.
Debenhams declined to comment. Its shares were down 10 percent at 1.8 pence.
Despite its long history, Debenhams has been battling for survival after a consumer shift online and to cheaper outlets destroyed 90 percent of its share value in the past year.
The company, which had 19 million customers and 2.9 billion pounds in sales last year, has said it needs to refinance its balance sheet and restructure the business to make it more sustainable. It plans to close about 50 underperforming stores, putting about 4,000 jobs at risk.
With a deadline looming that would give the lenders full control of Debenhams, Ashley has stepped up efforts to beat them to it. Owning 30 percent of the group, he has already forced the chairman out of the company and the CEO off the board.
As well as the underwritten rights issue, Sports Direct said it is still considering its options regarding the 61 million pound takeover offer it made at the end of March. It has until April 22 to make a firm offer or walk away.
LACK OF TRUST
However, a source familiar with the situation said that there is a lack of trust between the two sides, with Debenhams fearing that Ashley could renege on his investment offer after he takes control.
If no solution can be found, Debenhams will fall into the hands of its lenders at the close of business of Monday. It is then likely to be put in a so-called pre-pack administration that enables stores to keep operating while its lenders restructure the operations and seek to cut rents.
""Ashley becoming CEO is a major sticking point for the lenders; there is a major trust deficit here,"" the source said, declining to be named because the talks are private.
For its part, Sports Direct said Debenhams and its advisers had undertaken a ""sustained program of falsehoods and denials"" and called on board members Terry Duddy and David Adams to take a lie detector test.
The company added that Ashley had taken his own lie detector test, after the companies clashed in a meeting, and said: ""Mike Ashley's score, for example, was so significantly high as to be considered rare in comparison to others"".
Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the strings attached to Ashley's offer looked too much for the lenders to swallow.
""In theory, a deal could be struck, but relations seem far from cordial and the Debenhams management look set on giving the lenders control,"" he said.
Ashley, who also owns Premier League soccer club Newcastle United, made his fortune from building retailer Sports Direct into a dominant presence on Britain's shopping streets and online.
The 54-year-old businessman said in March that he was willing to step down as CEO of Sports Direct if he could take an executive position at Debenhams.
In recent years he has pounced on other weak retailers, including department store chain House of Fraser, and analysts have speculated that he could put the two together and could also use Debenhams' excess store space to sell brands he already owns.

It is one of the oldest warnings in sports: Great athletes, they say, don’t often become great coaches.
In the case of Magic Johnson, the legendary former Los Angeles Lakers point guard, that maxim must be amended. For Johnson, neither the front office nor the bench proved to be a winning or even comfortable habitat like the hardwood he used as a launching pad to basketball immortality.
Johnson’s forgettable coaching career with the Lakers lasted just 16 games at the close of the 1993-94 season before he unhappily vowed never to return to that occupation. Then this week, Johnson’s two-year reign as the Lakers’ president of basketball operations ended even more ignominiously.
He abruptly announced his resignation before the team’s final game of an
enormously disappointing season
, then revealed that he had told the news media of the decision before he had informed his boss, Jeanie Buss, in order to deny Buss an opportunity to talk him out of it.
Johnson, of course, has stunned the world before, with his announcement and early retirement in 1991 because he was found to be H.I.V. positive, followed by his brief return to basketball in 1996. He spent the ensuing two decades constructing a business and entertainment empire replete with a highly successful chain of movie theaters and an ownership stake in the storied Los Angeles Dodgers. But Johnson always insisted that he was, first and foremost, a Laker.
Handling his exit in such a haphazard manner has earned Johnson untold amounts of criticism in the days since, given how much the Lakers mean to Southern Californians and how unexpected this news was. Yet he seems prepared to take the hits in exchange for the opportunity to return to his more customary post-playing life “on the other side,” as he described it — forever a Laker but officially unattached to any team.
“I like to be free,” Johnson said.
But his freedom comes at a steep cost — to Johnson, to the Lakers, to a Hollywood belief in, well, magic.
It turns out Magic Johnson, who piloted some of the greatest teams in N.B.A. history, will not be the savior who helps the Lakers escape their longest run of futility.
After last summer’s blockbuster signing of LeBron James, Johnson proclaimed the Lakers to be “back” — with the promise of a return to full “back back” status this summer once they acquired at least one superstar sidekick to James. Johnson has instead fled just when the most crucial work was about to commence, with no clear path to bringing that second star to a flailing franchise that last reached the playoffs in 2013 and last won a championship in 2010.
When he convened an impromptu news conference Tuesday night, rather than reveal his updated plan to restore the Lakers to title contention and placate a frustrated fan base, Johnson did just the opposite. Describing himself as “happier when I wasn’t the president,” he explained that the conditions and pressures attached to building a championship team around James meant that the real Magic “couldn’t come out.”
In a series of rambling interviews with a number of news outlets while the Lakers were in the process of losing their regular-season finale to the Portland Trail Blazers, Johnson spoke of how he had longed to send a congratulatory tweet to Oklahoma City’s Russell Westbrook or to tutor Ben Simmons, the rising Philadelphia 76ers star, without inciting a storm of tampering allegations.
“I knew if I stayed in the role,” he said, “I’m giving up a lot of me.”
Such disclosures, of course, only served to validate much of the skepticism that greeted Buss’s decision to install Johnson as the new face of the Lakers’ basketball operations in February 2017.
Rival front-office executives questioned Johnson’s lack of experience in the modern game and his willingness to embrace the all-encompassing nature of the job from the moment he was named to replace the much-maligned Jim Buss (Jeanie’s brother) and Mitch Kupchak, the longtime Lakers executive. Those questions only rose in volume when Buss named as Magic’s sidekick another front-office neophyte, Rob Pelinka, Kobe Bryant’s polarizing former agent.
There were red flags from the start. In taking on his first active role with an N.B.A. team since his second retirement as a player in 1996, Johnson admitted that he had much to learn about navigating the ins and outs of the N.B.A.’s complex salary cap and the rhythms of a job that had evolved so much in his time away.
“The main part for me is really learning the other part that I didn’t know, and that is to understand the C.B.A., the salary cap, where we are in terms of the salary cap and who’s a free-agent-to-be,”
Johnson told USA Today
of the challenges he faced in building a roster and understanding the collective bargaining agreement.
Part of the issue might have been that Johnson could never just be a basketball executive. He is a mogul and a cultural force. While other N.B.A. teams primarily lean on decision makers focusing solely on basketball, Johnson seemed to always have his eye on something bigger than the game itself — reaching with his business tentacles to as many corners as possible.
Johnson acquired a 4.5 percent share of the Lakers in 1994
before selling his stake in 2010
. He even once hosted a syndicated late-night talk show,
1998’s “The Magic Hour.”
And he was never just about one game either,
acquiring a minority stake in the Dodgers
in 2012
and one in the Los Angeles Football Club of Major League Soccer in 2014
.
Business had clearly been on Johnson’s mind when he took the Lakers’ front-office job in 2017. He told “CBS This Morning”
in an interview
at the time that he had turned down other offers to run a franchise, including the embattled Knicks, but that he felt it was the right time to rejoin the Lakers.
“At this point in my life, you know, I think that I can do it right now because my businesses are running smooth,” Johnson said. “I can turn them over to my executive team that I have.” In that same interview, he said, “I always wanted to be the male Oprah.”
Johnson was one of the first athletes to build an empire for himself outside professional sports. He went from whipping behind-the-back passes and being the engine that made the 1980s Showtime Lakers rev to investing in more than 100
Starbucks
and
Burger King locations
, among many other business investments, all while flashing his famed charismatic grin. According to a
Basketball Reference estimate
, Johnson made about $23 million from N.B.A. salary alone, not including endorsements. Now his net worth is in the hundreds of millions.
The business of reviving the Lakers, however, proved beyond him. Buss, as a result, is already facing pressure to rebound from her nostalgic faith in Johnson to pursue a more accomplished executive this time — such as Golden State’s Bob Myers or San Antonio’s R. C. Buford — to plot the team’s recovery from a season soaked in drama and dysfunction.
Bizarre as the timing seemed, Johnson insisted to reporters that there were no hidden reasons for leaving other than the desire, as he put it to ESPN’s Rachel Nichols, to stop “letting myself down by not being Magic Johnson.”
What’s clear is that walking away when he did spared him from firing Coach Luke Walton — something Walton and his assistant coaches, according to two people with knowledge of the situation who were not authorized to discuss it publicly, had been bracing for this week. Walton’s culpability for the Lakers’ 37-45 record is a matter of debate, given all of this season’s injuries, but Johnson’s desire to make a change had been widely anticipated in league circles for weeks, if not months. Buss’s well-chronicled fondness for Walton is thought to be the only thing that had kept him in place throughout Johnson’s reign.
“I would have to affect someone’s livelihood and their life,” Johnson told reporters Tuesday night, seemingly confirming that he was poised to fire Walton. “And I thought about that. That’s not fun for me. That’s not who I am.”
There had never been a player like Johnson before he was drafted out of Michigan State as the first pick in the 1979 N.B.A. draft. His court vision, quickness, length and versatility made him a dominant presence and led to his winning three Most Valuable Player Awards and five N.B.A. championships. He became perhaps the defining face of what it means to be a Laker — no easy feat given the deep well of great players who have worn their familiar purple-and-gold jersey.
But the fact that Buss has yet to address the news media, beyond a brief statement insisting that the organization still believed “there is no greater Los Angeles Laker than Earvin Johnson,” speaks to the team’s level of shock that he would step down without warning.
At a speaking engagement at Chapman University on April 3, Buss acknowledged that the Lakers “haven’t lived up to the brand my father created,” referring to one of the most successful owners in the history of American team sports: Jerry Buss. The signing of James in free agency last summer — for which Johnson is sometimes subjected to claims that his “closer” role was overstated — could not prevent the Lakers from extending their playoff drought to a franchise-worst sixth consecutive season. That figure matches the Knicks for the league’s third-longest active drought behind Sacramento (13 seasons) and Phoenix (nine).
Now, the onus falls squarely on Buss to find a successor to repair a roster in need of overhaul.
To Johnson’s relief, such issues are no longer his concern. He returns now to a world he may have felt increasingly more comfortable with anyway in recent years: the one outside basketball. As he
told The Los Angeles Times in 2008
, Johnson hoped to go down in history as a better businessman than an athlete.
“That’s my dream,” Johnson said. “And I’m going after it each and every day.”

For Dwyane Wade's final NBA game, where else would his so-called Banana Boat Crew members be but on hand to see it?
Wade ended his 16-year career Wednesday night when his Miami Heat visited the Brooklyn Nets at the Barclays Center, and among the spectators were his longtime friends and fellow NBA stars LeBron James, Chris Paul and Carmelo Anthony.
Of course they would be there, James said during the game. James was shut down for several of the Lakers' final games and Paul's Thunder played their final regular-season game Tuesday night. Anthony did not sign with another NBA team after his release from the Rockets this season.
""Listen, we all started this journey together,"" James told Fox Sports Southeast. ""Obviously CP came into the league a couple years after us, but we have a brotherhood that is just so much more than basketball. CP played last night, we had our last regular-season game last night, and Melo is right here in New York, so we kind of made the plan and made the decision to come up here.""
The friends often travel together during the summer and picked up the Banana Boat Crew moniker after photos of them riding in one circulated on social media in 2016.
James, who won two NBA titles with Wade in Miami, two of the three Wade won altogether, was asked about favorite memories of his friendship with Wade. James said a good answer to that would take a while.
""I mean, we'd be here all night talking. We'd be here all night talking about the best memories, or the most fond memories I have of D-Wade.
""The plane rides, the bus rides, the hotels when we get to the city we'd go to the hotel room and just chop it up, the dinners we had on the road, everything we did was always genuine. (There was) always love, and we always wanted the best for one another, no matter the good or the bad.
""I will say the most founding part was when we lost (to Dallas in 2011). Because, without ‘11, there's no (2013), no (2012 championship) banners hanging up in (AmericanAirlines Arena). That's what made us. That's what made our team.
""It's been an unbelievable journey for my guy, and I'm happy to be here for the last little part of the road before the train comes to a stop.""

Soccer officials from one of FIFA’s largest confederations have gathered this week in Malaysia’s capital, Kuala Lumpur, to elect a president. The balloting will take place at the end of a long day of speeches, motions and reports, but at least the setting — the luxurious Shangri-La Hotel — promises to be comfortable.
Before the vote is held, the incumbent, Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa of Bahrain, will have the opportunity to make a speech outlining his qualifications. His opponent will not.
That is because, as usual, there is no opponent.
For the third time in less than a year — the fourth will come in June — one of soccer’s largest and most powerful governing bodies will rubber-stamp the election of its leader in
a one-candidate election
. South America’s governing body, Conmebol, went first last May, when it granted President Alejandro Domínguez an unopposed second term, and Europe’s governing body, UEFA, followed suit in February by
re-electing Aleksandr Ceferin
. In June, FIFA’s president, Gianni Infantino, will retain his post in yet another walkover.
“There has always seemed to be a great deal of fear around challenging the incumbent and because of the potential for retribution built into the system,” said Alexandra Wrage, president of the corporate governance adviser Trace International. For that reason, she said, regular uncontested elections are “not all that surprising.”
Wrage previously advised FIFA on corporate governance reforms before quitting in 2013. She has since become one of the organization’s most vocal critics.
In Asia, Sheikh Salman had been challenged — briefly — by opponents from the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, two countries at the center of a broad political dispute that has spilled into soccer in
a variety
of
ways
, but both dropped out of the race late last month after a series of behind-the-scenes meetings in the Gulf.
Sheikh Salman’s presidency has been marred by controversy since he was elected in 2013 to replace Mohamed Bin Hammam, a wealthy Qatari businessman who was banned for life in the wake of a corruption investigation. His
connections to Bahrain’s royal family
, for example, have led to Sheikh Salman’s recusing himself from a role in some of the Asian Football Confederation’s most sensitive decisions, such as in the highly publicized case of Hakeem al-Araibi, a soccer player who fled to Australia after claiming he had been tortured by the Bahraini government during pro-democracy demonstrations there in 2011.
Salman also did not take part in discussions over how to deal with the pirating of the A.F.C.’s Qatari broadcast partner’s programing by an illegal operation based in Saudi Arabia. Bahrain is among the countries backing the Saudi-led blockade of Qatar.
The re-election of incumbents, routinely without opposition, is common in soccer, where the power structures remain closely held despite a sprawling investigation in 2015 by the United States Department of Justice that exposed corruption schemes at the highest levels of the sport dating back decades.
The American case largely avoided implicating officials in Asia, but by then regional soccer leaders had already faced a reckoning after a series of internal investigations into the conduct of Sheikh Salman’s predecessor, Bin Hammam, and his leadership team. Those reports, including one by the former F.B.I. chief Louis Freeh, exposed a series of unexplained payments made to soccer officials throughout Asia and Africa.
The reports, three in total, which have been reviewed by The New York Times, exposed a series of payments made on behalf of Bin Hammam by the A.F.C.’s longtime media partner, World Sports Group, and specifically its regional head, the Lebanese businessman Pierre Kakhia. The payments included legal fees for an official from Tahiti who was facing an ethics ban, and money to a consulting firm hired to promote Bin Hammam’s bid for the FIFA presidency.
Despite his links to Bin Hammam, Kakhia remains a trusted consultant to the A.F.C., currently responsible for handling millions of dollars worth of sponsorship contracts, even though he last worked for W.S.G.’s parent company in 2016.
The A.F.C. declined to say why it had retained the services of Kakhia.
As well as Sheikh Salman’s re-election, delegates at the meeting in Kuala Lumpur will pick candidates for coveted places on global soccer’s ruling body, the FIFA Council. That contest, featuring eight candidates vying for six places, has proved to be contentious.
South Korean officials have complained to the A.F.C. over perceived double standards in ethics rules after their country was barred from inviting soccer officials to Seoul to attend an exhibition game last month, a prohibition that was not extended to Qatar, which wrote to officials inviting them on an all-expenses paid trip to attend two matches there. Both South Korea and Qatar have candidates in the election, as does the Philippines, whose candidate, the South Koreans contend, has been using a private jet owned by a Qatari official to travel across the region during his campaign.
“We urgently request you to review this matter in relation to any violation against the relevant regulations in force,” the Korean soccer federation president, Chong Mong-gyu, wrote in a letter to the A.F.C. The A.F.C., which confirmed it had received the South Koreans’ complaint, declined to say why it had not issued the same warning to Qatar.
Sheikh Salman’s challengers dropped out of the presidential race after a series of decisions by the A.F.C., including the surprising move to break an exclusive television contract with the A.F.C.’s broadcast partner, the Qatari broadcaster BeIN Sports, in order to allow games to be broadcast in Saudi Arabia, where games have been broadcast illegally for almost two years. BeIN said it planned to sue the A.F.C. over the decision.
Until that decision, Saudi Arabia had been supporting an Emirati candidate, Mohammad Khalfan al-Rumaithi. Rumaithi withdrew his candidacy shortly after the television agreement was struck. The third candidate, Saoud al-Mohannadi of Qatar, soon followed suit.

(Reuters) - Dream11 on Tuesday became India's first gaming startup to be valued at over $1 billion after its latest round of investment, joining the country's fast-growing ""unicorn"" club.
The gaming platform, which has a 90 percent market share in the Indian fantasy sports market according to a IFSG-KPMG report, allows users to create teams for different sports.
The company on Tuesday announced the completion of a secondary investment by hedge fund Steadview Capital to cross the billion mark.
Dream11 declined to disclose the terms of the deal.
The deal involves a secondary sale of shares by investors Kalaari Capital, Think Investments and Multiples Equity to Asia-focused Steadview.
The gaming platform, which expects to end the year with 100 million users, also counts Tencent Holdings Ltd as one of its backers.
Dream11 has partnerships with sports bodies and leagues such as the International Cricket Council and the National Basketball Association among others.
Users pay an entry fee to participate in paid contests and the company makes money by charging a platform fee from the total pool collected.
Dream11 has however faced legal challenges due to the similarities of fantasy gaming to gambling, which is largely illegal in India.
Its legitimacy was challenged in a court in India, which ruled that fantasy gaming involves skill rather than chance, according to a report in April last year. (https://bit.ly/2qd8qYZ)

MELBOURNE — Australian Rules players will tear through a banner of hateful tweets before a top flight match on Friday as part of a campaign against online bullying.
The indigenous game has been rocked by a string of social media controversies in recent weeks, with Aboriginal players suffering racist taunts and a prominent female footballer complaining of ""sexual abuse"" online.
To raise awareness of the problem, the Melbourne Demons will hoist a banner emblazoned with negative tweets about players and teams at the Melbourne Cricket Ground before their Australian Football League match against Essendon Bombers.
Players running through huge banners made by 'cheer squads' from crepe paper and sticky tape has been an Australian Rules tradition for over 70 years, although most showcase motivational messages or key milestones for players.
The Demons players running through the banner on Friday would ""highlight how online harassment is a major issue not just for AFL players but for the one in five young Australians who are victims of cyber-bullying"", the team said.
The Demons teamed up with ""Reach"", a youth-focused charity set up by the late former Melbourne player and president Jim Stynes, on the initiative.
In a promotional video on the Demons' website (melbournefc.com.au), Melbourne's Aboriginal defender Neville Jetta holds up a placard with a tweet describing him as a ""scum bag"".
Jetta said he had been deeply affected by racist online abuse, particularly early in his career.
""In my early days I probably wasn't strong enough to call it out and they were the ones that I just deleted,"" the 29-year-old told an AFL chat show on local broadcaster Fox Sports.
""It's not just racism, it's actually bullying, bullying people, and AFL players have that stance where we're able to speak out to the community and people actually listen to us.""
Last week, Melbourne-based AFL club Richmond Tigers handed a two-year ban to a supporter who made racially abusive comments about West Coast Eagles forward Liam Ryan.
Ryan, a 22-year-old Aboriginal, was called a ""monkey"" by multiple social media users on a local broadcaster's Instagram account.
The sanction came days after AFL Women's player Tayla Harris complained of ""sexual abuse"" after a photograph of her kicking a goal triggered a raft of offensive comments on a broadcaster's social media account.

The Orioles first baseman is 0 for his last 49. Why is he still in the lineup? A Nobel Prize-winning economist explains the flawed logic behind letting Davis’s contract dictate his playing time.
By
Benjamin Hoffman
On
Sept. 14, 2018
, Chris Davis, who had been hitless in his last 17 at-bats, got a 2-1 changeup from White Sox pitcher James Shields, and jumped on it. Davis lined the ball through the shift into right field, hustling his way to second for a double.
Since that day, Davis, a 33-year-old slugger for the Baltimore Orioles who once hit 53 home runs in a season, has known nothing but ignominy. He went hitless in his final 21 at-bats of the 2018 season, clinching the worst batting average for a qualified player in major league history (.168).
On Monday, he made another dark entry into the record books: After an 0-for-5 performance in Baltimore’s 12-4 win over Oakland, he reached 49 consecutive at-bats without a hit, breaking the previous record of 46, set by Eugenio Velez across the 2010 and 2011 seasons.
The extraordinary run of futility raises an obvious question: Why are the Orioles still putting Davis out in the field? When reporters asked exactly that before Monday’s game, Manager Brandon Hyde said, “He really wanted to play today.”
In truth, the decision to keep playing Davis almost certainly has more to do with his $17 million salary this year and the $93 million the Orioles owe him beyond 2019 in salary and deferred payments, which will have the team sending him paychecks through the 2037 season. Considering the amount of money the team has committed to Davis, his situation might be less suited for a manager like Hyde than it is for someone like Richard Thaler, the Nobel Prize-winning economist at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business.
To Thaler, the Orioles’s refusal to sideline Davis is a classic example of the sunk cost fallacy, an economic principle he detailed in his book
“Misbehaving: The Making of Behavioral Economics.”
“A classic example is you order some dessert at a restaurant and it costs $15,” Thaler said in a phone interview. “You take a couple bites and you realize you were already full and this dessert is really rich, but you feel like you can’t waste the whole thing. So you eat more of it than you should.”
Ideally, Thaler said, the correct decision is to ignore any cost that has already been paid and evaluate the situation strictly on its own merit. One of his favorite illustrations of sunk cost, he said, is deciding whether or not to attend a basketball game you had purchased tickets for even though attending would mean traveling through a blizzard.
“The mistake people make is thinking that somehow using this player, or eating that dessert, or going to the game is getting some of that money back,” he said. “It’s not. It’s just making you feel a little better about a purchase that turned out to be not a very good one.”
If the Orioles are waiting for Davis to pull out of his tailspin, they are ignoring the fact that players are typically at their physical peak at around 27 years old — Davis’s age in 2013 when his 53-homer season inspired his $161 million contract — and then generally see a decline in performance. In Davis’s case, there was an immediate dip in 2014 before a brief resurgence in 2015, but in the three-plus seasons since he has hit .199 over 1,520 at-bats, with an on-base plus slugging percentage of .684 that, adjusted for his home park, is 15 percent worse than league average in that period.
Unlike Velez, or the previous record holders, Bill Bergen (1909) and Dave Campbell (1973) and Craig Counsell (2011) — who each had an 0-for-45 streak — Davis is not staying in the lineup because of his glove. He was rated as a below-average fielder by Sports Info Solutions in each of the previous two seasons, meaning he makes his living almost entirely with his bat. And yet: In his last 56 plate appearances, his total offensive output has consisted of six walks, two R.B.I. and 27 strikeouts.
Davis, who has occasionally been booed in Baltimore this season, received mostly encouragement from the 6,585 fans at Camden Yards on Monday — a number that also set a team record for futility (aside from
a game in 2015 to which no fans were admitted
). Hyde has also continued to look for a silver lining no matter how cloudy things get.
“He hit three balls on the nose,” he told reporters after Monday’s game, though none of that contact resulted in a hit. “So I’m taking that as a positive moving forward. Hopefully it’s a good start.”
Thaler, channeling the statistician Bill James, correctly guessed that Davis had been worth around minus-3 wins above replacement over the last two years — Baseball Reference had him at minus-2.8 last season and has yet to release any 2019 numbers. That figure compounds the cost of the already-bad deal: Davis and his negative value have been taking up a roster spot and playing time that could be given to a low-cost player from the minor leagues.
Thaler acknowledged that while the concept of the sunk-cost fallacy is an easy one for people to comprehend, many will still convince themselves to ignore reality in the face of a hard decision and push forward despite the cost.
“In the case of sports teams, management may think that — suppose they just cut him — that they’re going to look like idiots,” he said. “Of course, what’s true is playing him makes them look like bigger idiots.”
Thaler said he believed that if he were an owner, he would congratulate a general manager willing to admit a mistake and move along from a bad deal.
Barring that, he said Davis’s example could be used for teams to better understand how to approach large deals in the future. If the team is one that will keep a player on the field no matter what, then that team should avoid long-term deals. But, he said, an owner willing to spend money as well as eat the cost if things go south could be rewarded, as it would offer potential benefits without a later compounding of errors.
Davis did not play in Tuesday’s 13-2 loss to the Athletics. Thaler believes the team’s best bet moving forward is to go one step further than benching him: The team should cut Davis and replace him with a minor leaguer, as even a so-called replacement (or near average) player would represent a significant improvement.
“They could win, let’s say two or three more games this year at a cost of half a million,” he said. “That would be the cheapest two or three wins you could possibly buy. That would be like adding a star.”

MINNEAPOLIS — Braxton Key was in Pittsburgh readying for Alabama’s second-round game against Villanova on the evening of last March 16, when he got an “upset alert” on his phone. Virginia was trailing the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.
“I was like: There’s no way. They’re playing a 16 seed,” Key recalled Monday night. “I turned the game on, and, sure enough, they did.”
Virginia — for the seven of you who still don’t know — lost, 74-54, in the first round of last year’s N.C.A.A. tournament, becoming the first top seed to lose to a bottom seed in 33 years of the full-size men’s bracket.
Key texted his condolences to Virginia’s Kyle Guy, a friend from summer basketball in years past, immediately after. “He didn’t text me back for a couple days,” Key said. “I could understand.”
Alabama lost to Villanova the following day, and Villanova won the national championship. Key, a cousin of the former Virginia great Ralph Sampson, transferred to Virginia and got an N.C.A.A. waiver letting him play this season.
And on Monday night, with essential contributions from Key, Virginia won its first national championship, defeating Texas Tech in overtime, 85-77, just one year after that devastating, infamous defeat.
“I just thought with our work ethic, our drive, and whatever was fueling us from last year, about losing to U.M.B.C., I just thought we had a good chance to win it all,” Key said on the court amid the confetti.
Virginia’s trajectory from last year to this year has to count among the most dramatic in sports. Its players and coach, Tony Bennett, had to have known that anything short of a national championship this season would have been at once credited to last year’s devastating defeat.
This was particularly true after the team got a No. 1 seed, the program’s fourth in six seasons. In all six games of this tournament, the Cavaliers were the team with the better seed. There was no game they were not supposed to win, even as observers doubted them every time. It was like walking a tightrope made of eggshells stretched over very thin ice.
“Not after last year,” the associate head coach Jason Williford said. “No one could have thought that we’d do this.”
“I don’t know how we won,” he added. “Not this, but the two prior to this.”
Indeed. Virginia did not make it easy on its frayed nerves with a series of closer-than-close contests in this tournament. It trailed this year’s No. 16 seed, Gardner-Webb, at halftime. It defeated Oregon, a No. 12 seed, by 4 points. Its regional final, against Purdue, was salvaged thanks to the freshman Kihei Clark’s
pass
across half the court to Mamadi Diakite, who forced overtime with a quick shot. Saturday’s national semifinal victory over Auburn came courtesy of Guy’s
being fouled
on a 3-pointer with a second left and hitting all three free throws to put his team up by one.
That left Monday night’s final, in which Texas Tech outscored Virginia by 10 in the last 10 minutes, and the Cavaliers were kept alive only by De’Andre Hunter’s 3-pointer with 14 seconds left.
Effectively Virginia’s sixth man, Key was an important but not focal player this season.
But Monday night, he played 28 minutes — far higher than his season average of 19.8 minutes, even accounting for the five-minute overtime period.
He quietly led his team in rebounds, with 10. He half-blocked the Texas Tech star Jarrett Culver’s layup midway through the second half, and then fully blocked Culver’s shot at the end of regulation, preventing what could have been a buzzer-beater to doom the Cavaliers. He no-look assisted on a Guy score late in the second half, and assisted on a Hunter 3-pointer in overtime.
Key’s plus-minus — the statistic that states the score of the game during the minutes a player played — was +18, by far the highest.
His role was, if not precisely part of the master plan, then at least a foreseeable eventuality, according to a Virginia coach. In many ways, it all came back to U.M.B.C.
Last off-season, Virginia’s coaches saw in Key not only a talented, high-character player with ties to the program. They saw a 6-foot-8 jigsaw puzzle piece that fit perfectly into the team that was taking shape after the departures of the seniors Isaiah Wilkins and Devon Hall.
“He provided skills that we needed,” the assistant coach Brad Soderberg said. “We had just graduated Isaiah Wilkins. We needed a guy who could rebound, we needed a guy who could handle the ball, who had size.”
In fact, Soderberg said, there was one game in particular from Virginia’s previous season that pointed to its shortcoming when it came to going small: the game in which five players, none taller than 6-5, shot 12 from 24 from deep to beat Virginia by 20 in college basketball’s most historic loss.
“U.M.B.C.,” Soderberg said. “They played five guys smaller than us and hammered us.”
On Monday, with Texas Tech’s starting center, Tariq Owens, not playing at 100 percent because of a sprained ankle, the Red Raiders elected to go small, playing lineups with less size — but more speed and mobility — than their country-best defense typically deployed. (It is part of why the game was not the low-scoring, unexciting slugfest that some had feared.)
Texas Tech’s tactical choice prompted Virginia to go small as well, according to Soderberg. And that meant many minutes for Key.
Virginia’s 2018 humiliation and its 2019 triumph seem destined to live on in tandem, a yin and a yang contextualizing and balancing the other.
Perhaps the wedge that separates the two events is a player like Hunter, who was the Atlantic Coast Conference sixth man of the year last season and led all players Monday night with a career-high 27 points but who did not play in the U.M.B.C. game because of a wrist injury. Or a player like Clark, a freshman. Or Key, who arrived last summer with substantial experience yet a clean slate on a team still reeling from the previous March.
“I wish it wouldn’t have happened in some ways,” Bennett said of the U.M.B.C. loss. “Now I say, well, it bought us a ticket here. So be it.”
Key had a less ambivalent take. Referring to the documentary series about extraordinary sports happenings, he said, “We should definitely have a ‘30 for 30.’”

For Dwyane Wade's final NBA game, where else would his so-called Banana Boat Crew members be but on hand to see it?
Wade ended his 16-year career with a bang Wednesday night, producing his fifth career triple-double as he amassed 25 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists in the Miami Heat's 113-94 loss to the Brooklyn Nets.
Sitting courtside to watch Wade in his final NBA game were his longtime friends and fellow NBA stars LeBron James, Chris Paul and Carmelo Anthony.
Of course they would be there, James said during the game. James was shut down for several of the Lakers' final games and Paul's Houston Rockets played their final regular-season game Tuesday night. Anthony did not sign with another NBA team after his release from the Chicago Bulls this season after he was traded by the Rockets.
""Listen, we all started this journey together,"" James told Fox Sports Southeast. ""Obviously CP came into the league a couple years after us, but we have a brotherhood that is just so much more than basketball. CP played last night, we had our last regular-season game last night, and Melo is right here in New York, so we kind of made the plan and made the decision to come up here.""
The friends often travel together during the summer and picked up the Banana Boat Crew moniker after photos of them riding in one circulated on social media in 2016.
James, who won two NBA titles with Wade in Miami, two of the three Wade won altogether, was asked about favorite memories of his friendship with Wade. James said a good answer to that would take a while.
""I mean, we'd be here all night talking. We'd be here all night talking about the best memories, or the most fond memories I have of D-Wade.
""The plane rides, the bus rides, the hotels when we get to the city we'd go to the hotel room and just chop it up, the dinners we had on the road, everything we did was always genuine. (There was) always love, and we always wanted the best for one another, no matter the good or the bad.
""I will say the most founding part was when we lost (to Dallas in 2011). Because, without '11, there's no (2013), no (2012 championship) banners hanging up in (AmericanAirlines Arena). That's what made us. That's what made our team.
""It's been an unbelievable journey for my guy, and I'm happy to be here for the last little part of the road before the train comes to a stop.""

Kentucky standout sophomore PJ Washington declared for the NBA draft on Tuesday and will hire an agent, the school announced.
""This place has been my home for two years and it's hard for me to put in words how much I've grown in my time at Kentucky. The staff challenged me from day one to become the best version of myself and to work hard to become one of the best players in college basketball. I feel like I've done that,"" Washington said in a statement posted on the Wildcats' website.
The 6-foot-8 forward ends his career with 932 points, 476 rebounds, 120 assists and 74 blocks. He led the Wildcats in scoring (15.2) and rebounding (7.5) in the 2018-19 season. He also posted nine double-doubles and shot 52.2 percent from the floor, including 42.3 percent from the 3-point line.
Washington earned first-team All-SEC and third-team All-America honors. He is projected to be a mid-first-round pick by ESPN.
--Two-time SEC Player of the Year Grant Williams said he is entering the NBA draft but will remain open to returning to school for his senior season.
""My whole thing is I want to go into the process with an open mind and understand what I need to improve on and what I need to get better at, while also understanding I have to make the most informed decision possible,"" said Williams, who has until May 29 to make up his mind. ""If it is the right time, then it is the right time.""
The 6-foot-7 Williams averaged 18.8 points and 7.5 rebounds this season while earning first-team All-America honors.
-Michigan forward Ignas Brazdeikis, the 2018-19 Big Ten Freshman of the Year, and teammates Charles Matthews and Jordan Poole announced they will declare for the draft.
""As long as I can remember, I've wanted to be an NBA player -- not just an NBA player, but an NBA All-Star,"" said the 6-foot-7 Brazdeikis, a Canadian who averaged 14.8 points and 5.4 boards in 37 starts with the Wolverines.
Matthews, a junior guard, averaged 12.2 points and 5.0 rebounds this season, while Poole, a sophomore guard, averaged 12.8 points.
--St. John's junior guard Justin Simon declared for the draft and his decision was announced by RZA Sports, the entity that will represent him.
Simon averaged 10.4 points and posted 50 steals while earning Big East Defensive Player of the Year honors.
--Israel's Yovel Zoosman has submitted paperwork to the league office to become eligible for the draft, according to ESPN.
Ranked No. 58 in the ESPN Top 100, the 20-year-old wing player was named MVP of the FIBA U20 European Championship last July after leading the Israeli national team to the championship in Germany.

BRISTOL, Tenn. — The Latest on the Cup race at Bristol Motor Speedway (all times local):
2:20 p.m.
Kevin Harvick caught a break when an accident caused a caution as he was serving an early penalty at Bristol Motor Speedway.
Harvick's car failed inspection three times before Sunday's race, and one of the punishments was that he had to drive down pit road at the start. It was almost certainly going to put him several laps down, but the accident on the second lap bought him time.
Harvick fell only one lap off the pace because of the caution that started when William Byron, who started second, wiggled into Aric Almirola and Almirola hit the wall.
Kyle Busch tried to slow down and avoid the congestion but was plowed from behind by Ricky Stenhouse Jr. Busch went to pit road for repair, Almirola took his car to the garage and the race was only minutes old. Almirola was knocked out of the race and will finish last, while Stenhouse dropped seven laps off the pace while getting his repairs.
Chase Elliott started from the pole and led the first 39 laps but was involved in a second caution. Ryan Preece had a cut tire that made him spin, and Elliott was hit from behind by Corey LaJoie as they tried to avoid Preece. It caused Elliott to spin and damage his power steering. Elliott dropped to ninth.

2 p.m.
Kevin Harvick has been penalized before the start of Sunday's race at Bristol Motor Speedway because his car failed inspection three times.
His engineer was ejected from the event and Harvick lost his 13th-place starting position. He must start at the back of the field at the .533-mile bullring and immediately serve a pass-thru penalty on pit road. It will be nearly impossible for Harvick not to be lapped during the sequence.
NASCAR moved the start of the race up by eight minutes in preparation for potential rain during the event.
Chase Elliott and William Byron will lead the field to green in an all-Hendrick Motorsports front row. The organization is still seeking its first win of the season, as is manufacturer Chevrolet.
Through seven races this season, only Joe Gibbs Racing in Toyotas and Team Penske in Fords have won Cup events.
Kyle Busch is the defending race winner, and his Gibbs teammate Erik Jones is racing for a $1 million donation to Children's Miracle Network through the Ace Hardware Foundation if he wins.
Darrell Waltrip will give his trademark ""Boogity! Boogity! Boogity! Let's go racing, boys!"" call to start the race from the flagstand. Bristol made him the honorary starter to recognize his upcoming retirement as Fox Sports' lead analyst.

(Reuters) - Sports Direct said on Monday Debenhams rejected its offer to underwrite a 150 million pound rights issue in exchange for a CEO role for Mike Ashley and a pledge by lenders to write off 148 million pounds of debt.
Sports Direct, controlled by billionaire Ashley, said its preconditional possible offer for Debenhams at 5 pence in cash per ordinary share announced last month was still on the table.
Earlier in the day, Ashley had embarked on a last-ditch battle to take control of Debenhams, accusing board members of dishonesty, while offering to fund a rescue plan in return for the CEO's job.

The ball was inbounded to Notre Dame guard Arike Ogunbowale. “Four, three, two,” came the shouts, counting down the expiring clock. Ogunbowale put up the shot … and … it was an air ball.
No matter. This happened last month, during a practice at the Joyce Center in South Bend, Ind., on the day before the Fighting Irish women’s team played its regular-season finale. Notre Dame won that game, as it has won all but three games this year. It needs to win only two more to claim its second straight national championship; the first could come in the national semifinals Friday night, when Notre Dame (34-3) faces Connecticut (35-2).
[Read our
preview of the N.C.A.A. Women’s Final Four
here.]
Ogunbowale will be ready. Now a senior, she has made buzzer-beaters when they counted. Specifically, last year, in a
sequence
without precedent, Ogunbowale hit last-second shots to give her team victories in both
the semifinals
and
the championship game
.
The stunning nature of Ogunbowale’s feats catapulted her to the kind of mainstream fame rarely bestowed on women’s college basketball, which despite improved play and the introduction of a few more top programs has struggled to broaden its appeal.
Ogunbowale
appeared
on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” where Kobe Bryant
greeted her
as a surprise guest. She participated in the television competition “Dancing With The Stars.” She won the ESPY Award for play of the year.
“Shout out to women’s basketball as a whole,” she said in her
acceptance speech
. “There’s a lot of people with their opinions about us, but all I got to say is, come see us on the court.”
It was a telling moment: Even in triumph, winning out over other worthy nominees, mostly from men’s sports, Ogunbowale chose to promote her game.
“There’s still a long way to go, which is why we have to advocate for ourselves,” Ogunbowale said in an interview last month.
“I think our Final Four was super-exciting,” she added, noting that the other semifinal had also gone to overtime, “and that got people thinking, like, O.K., yeah, it’s actually fun to watch.”
The Final Four, and the response to it, illustrated just how intertwined the discussion of women’s basketball is with a more meta discussion about women’s basketball’s popularity.
“If Arike were on the men’s side, you take that and roll with it,” said Courtney Cox, a doctoral candidate at the University of Southern California who studies women’s basketball. “But instead she has all this pressure to come back and do it again.”
If it wins twice this weekend, Notre Dame would be only the fourth women’s basketball team to repeat as national champion. And if Ogunbowale again plays a starring role, she seems as good a candidate as any to become the rare women’s basketball star to have the kind of first-name status enjoyed by star athletes like Michael, Kobe, LeBron and Serena.
“This notion of ‘growing the game’ is this phrase we hear a lot — W.N.B.A., college game,” Cox said. “But I think the game is flourishing. Part of it is acknowledging the disparity that’s already existed, the fact that the women’s tournament has only existed on the N.C.A.A. level since 1982.”
The college basketball establishment has changed several visible aspects of the women’s game in an effort to increase its exposure. For instance, Ogunbowale’s shots might have made a larger splash because they came on a Friday and a Sunday — the nights before the men’s semifinals and title game — rather than the Sunday-Tuesday time slots that the women’s Final Four had previously occupied.
That was one of several recommendations made in a paper that Val Ackerman, the first W.N.B.A. president, wrote for the N.C.A.A. in 2013 amid fears of declining attendance, stagnant ratings and a top-heavy women’s tournament. Others included experimental rule changes, such as a 24-second shot clock and toying with a slightly lower rim; considering making women’s basketball a one-semester sport; and even hosting the men’s and women’s Final Fours in the same city (or establishing a multiyear site for the women’s event, much as Omaha always hosts the College World Series).
“The visibility levels are a bit lower than they are in the men’s,” said Ackerman, who is now the Big East commissioner. “It’s just one of the broader challenges.”
Of Ogunbowale, Ackerman added, “The aftermath of that championship for her proved that it can happen, when you have compelling performances on a national stage.”
There is more than one kind of compelling, though. One of this season’s more interesting moments also involved Ogunbowale and occurred when Connecticut visited Notre Dame for a nonconference game in December. During the game, which the Huskies won easily, Ogunbowale received a technical foul when she appeared to have words with Connecticut Coach Geno Auriemma — the latest spat between the two, who once
subtweeted one another
when Ogunbowale dropped UConn from her list of programs during recruiting.
Neither Ogunbowale nor Notre Dame Coach Muffet McGraw would address the technical directly in interviews. But the argument that it was good for the game — that it resembled the drama that drives the N.B.A. news cycle — was
made
by the likes of the ESPN writer D’Arcy Maine, who said, “I’m here for all the pettiness.”
Much as the N.B.A. has
ridden the personalities of its stars
to greater popularity, women’s basketball’s growth will require what sports leagues have always needed: talented and charismatic stars.
“The more we can do to get the casual fan to go, ‘Oh, Notre Dame’s playing — I’m going to turn it on to see Arike,’” said McGraw, “the more interest, the more fans we’ll get.”
Coincidentally or not, broadcasts of Notre Dame regular-season games on ESPN networks were up 12 percent over last year, according to a network spokeswoman.
“It’s not there yet,” said Gregory Ogunbowale, Arike’s father. “Arike and the others are trying to put it on the map. O.K., we’re equally as good. As the father of a woman, I respect that. It’s not all about dunking, it’s about fundamentals, it’s about skills, and they have all those.”
He has noticed one difference, however. One of Arike’s older brothers, Dare, is a running back who has played for Wisconsin and now
a few N.F.L. teams
. In the past, Gregory said, when teachers at the Milwaukee elementary school where he is the principal would ask about Dare, others would mention that his daughter was an athlete, too. Now, he said, it’s the reverse.
“One of my colleagues a couple weeks ago passed by my office and said, ‘Hi, Arike’s Dad,’” he said. “I never heard that before.”

KUALA LUMPUR — Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa was re-elected unopposed to the position as president of the Asian Football Confederation on Saturday after the regional body's congress confirmed a new four-year term for the Bahraini by acclamation.
The 53-year-old, who was not present at the meeting due to the death of his mother earlier in the week, was handed a third term at the helm after his rivals, Mohammed Al Romaithi from the United Arab Emirates and Qatari Saoud Al Mohannadi, withdrew.
Sheikh Salman will extend his reign as president until at least 2023, by which time he will have completed a 10-year spell in charge of the 47-member body after initially completing the truncated term of former president Mohammed bin Hammam.
He took over for the last two years of Bin Hammam's stint as AFC president after the Qatari was banned for life by governing body FIFA from all football activities for his involvement in a corruption scandal.
A member of the Bahrian royal family, Sheikh Salman first came to prominence in footballing circles in 2009 when he faced off against Bin Hammam for a seat on FIFA's decision making body, a ballot he lost by a single vote.
However, he won the presidential election in 2013 and was returned unopposed in 2015 before running unsuccessfully against Gianni Infantino for the position of FIFA president the following year.
Initially elected on a platform of accountability, he has becoming increasingly distant during his presidency, rarely taking questions from the media since winning his second term of office.
The former Bahrain Football Association president has denied accusations he was involved in human rights abuses by the Gulf state's ruling family during a crackdown on democracy protesters in 2011.
The issue resurfaced in January when Sheikh Salman's position in world football was questioned by campaigners seeking the release of former Bahrain international Hakeem Al Araibi from a Thai detention centre under threat of extradition to the Gulf state.
Sheikh Salman did not comment publicly on the matter and the AFC later claimed to have recused him 18 months earlier from involvement in matters involving nations in the west of the continent due to a potential conflict of interests.
Those matters, though, have done little to dampen enthusiasm for him to remain in charge of Asia's governing body, with his hopes of reelection boosted in June last year when he signed off on a new deal for the AFC's commercial and broadcast rights.
The agreement with Chinese-backed company DDMC Fortis will ensure revenues more than double from those under the current agreement with long-term partner Lagardere Sports.

Three perennial powerhouses and an exciting interloper will seek spots in the national final.
By
Kelly Whiteside
TAMPA, Fla. — The Women’s Final Four on Friday will feature three teams that have at least one national title and one team, Oregon, seeking its first. If the Ducks become the champions, they will be the first team from the West Coast to claim the women’s crown since Stanford in 1992.
Baylor, a No. 1 seed, returns to the Final Four for the first time since winning the national title in 2012, and it has been a breeze to get here. The Lady Bears rolled over their tournament opponents by an average margin of 38.2 points behind the nation’s best defense and the powerhouse duo of 6-foot-7 Kalani Brown and 6-4 Lauren Cox. This is the first trip to the Final Four for Oregon, a second seed, and it has been a fun one given the Ducks’ spread-the-floor, pick-and-roll style of play. The Ducks have been called the Golden State Warriors of women’s college basketball with their pick and triple-double machine, Sabrina Ionescu, (19.9 points, 8.2 assists and 7.5 rebounds a game) playing the role of Stephen Curry.
“She’s an unbelievable talent, and her team is blazing a new trail for her program,” Curry said after the Warriors’ game on Wednesday.
The Ducks have the best 3-point shooting in the nation, 41.7 percent. To knock off the Lady Bears, they will need to connect at a similar rate.
The best rivalry in the women’s game will play out for the 50th time over all and for the eighth time in the Final Four. UConn, a second seed, leads the series, 37-12, but top-seeded Notre Dame has the edge at the Final Four, 4-3. The Huskies are competing in a record 12th consecutive Final Four and shooting for their 12th national championship.
Notre Dame, the defending national champ, is even more talented, and healthier, than last year. Last year, Notre Dame knocked off UConn in overtime in the national semifinals, but the Huskies won a regular-season matchup, 89-71, in December.
“Sports needs that kind of rivalry,” UConn Coach Geno Auriemma said. “We used to have that with Tennessee. Now we have it with Notre Dame. I think it’s cool. I think they’re the best team in the country. I don’t think anybody else is even close. Baylor. But I don’t think anybody else, I think, can match Notre Dame when they’re playing their A game. They just overwhelm you, man, at every position.”
Notre Dame features the talented backcourt pair of Arike Ogunbowale (21.5 points a game) and Jackie Young (15.1). The UConn seniors Napheesa Collier and Katie Lou Samuelson were freshmen the last time the Huskies won the national title, in 2016, and they are focused on ending their careers with another crown.

MINNEAPOLIS — Virginia got its redemption — thanks to its offense, not its vaunted defense.
Riding the broad shoulders of De'Andre Hunter, Virginia beat Texas Tech 85-77 in overtime Monday night to win the program's first national title.
Defensively-minded, the Cavaliers (35-3) turned a night of adjustments against Texas Tech's vaunted defense into one of college basketball's great redemption stories.
The loss to No. 16 UMBC will never be erased, but the taste has turned from sour to sweet in a year.
Hunter was the catalyst, scoring 25 points and grabbing nine rebounds. He had plenty of help from Virginia's better-than-last-year offense. Kyle Guy scored 24 points, Ty Jerome 16 and the Cavaliers made 11 3-pointers against the most efficient defense the past 17 years.
It took a night of schematic counterpunching to get the Wahoos to the top.
The average sports fan wants to see dunks, baskets in transition, revolving numbers on the scoreboard.
The Red Raiders (31-7) and Cavaliers are not that.
Their game is a different kind of beautiful, one based on brawn and beating a man to his spot.
That's what both teams did early. First media timeout: 5 combined points, one made field goal in nine shots.
The Cavaliers adjusted to the Red Raiders' constant switching by getting the ball to the middle and mixing in motion offense while building a 10-point lead.
Texas Tech spent the early part of the game hoisting up shots at the end of the shot clock as Virginia switched and hard-hedged screens, forcing the Red Raiders well away from the basket.
With coaches Chris Beard yelling for them to push the pace, the Red Raiders countered by getting into their offense quicker and moving the ball better. An 18-4 run pulled them within 32-29 at halftime.
The pawns kept changing positions in the second half.
Texas Tech went small when big man Tariq Owens picked up his third foul, so Virginia's Tony Bennett did the same. With more spacing, both teams went on a scoring spree, so Beard put Owens back in. Virginia big man Mamadi Diakite followed him from the scorer's table.
Virginia went up 10 behind Hunter and Guy got hot, beating the Red Raiders with a series of individual moves.
Moretti, Matt Mooney and Brandone Francis brought Texas Tech back by shooting over the top of the Cavaliers, hitting a string of 3-pointers.
Jerome did his one-on-one thing, beating a defender off the dribble to find Hunter in the corner for a 3-pointer. He knocked it down with 12.9 seconds left, sending the game to overtime.
Hunter hit the big shot in overtime, too, a 3-pointer that put the Cavaliers up 2.
Jerome hit a pair of free throws, then Guy. Diakite did the same and Braxton Key had the exclamation mark with a breakaway dunk.
Defined by its defense, Virginia is national champions because of its offense.

April 5 (Reuters) - Late goals by Mohamed Salah and Jordan Henderson earned Liverpool a crucial 3-1 victory at Southampton to move them back to the top of the Premier League on Friday.
For the second week running Liverpool looked like losing ground on Manchester City in a titanic title race, but once again Juergen Klopp's side would not be denied as they edged a step closer to a first league title since 1990.
With games running out they lead City by two points, although Pep Guardiola's champions have a game in hand.
Locked at 1-1 Liverpool were laying siege to the Southampton goal but it was Salah, who had not scored for eight games, who provided the moment of magic they desperately required in the 80th minute, racing away to score a majestic solo goal.
It was Salah's 50th Premier League goal for Liverpool and six minutes later Henderson, on as a substitute, wrapped it up with a close-range finish.
Shane Long had made it a nail-biting night for Liverpool's massed ranks of supporters when he fired relegation-threatened Southampton ahead in the ninth minute.
But Liverpool recovered from a surprisingly sluggish start and Naby Keita's header, his first goal for the club, levelled the scores before halftime.
Victory lifted Liverpool to 82 points from 33 games, with City on 80 from 32.
""It was very big. Every game is massive. We've got to win every game. I thought we showed great character in the first half,"" Henderson told Sky Sports. ""It was a big performance in the second half and a big result.""
Liverpool needed a stoppage-time winner to beat Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 at Anfield last weekend and they were forced to do things the hard way again at St Mary's.
They were caught cold early on and Long punished them, calmly firing home after Ryan Bertrand's cross was flicked on.
It could have been worse with Long almost making it 2-0 but Keita's header calmed the nerves in the away ranks.
Liverpool dominated after the break but Southampton defended tenaciously, even if they were lucky when Maya Yoshida appeared to bring down Keita in the penalty area.
With the clock ticking down and Southampton enjoying a brief flurry of pressure, Liverpool broke and Salah drove forward at pace, making around 50 metres without a challenge before firing the ball past Angus Gunn.
Southampton, who remain five points above the drop zone, were flattened and Liverpool were spared any late frights when Roberto Firmino found Henderson who stroked home.
An ecstatic Klopp joined in the celebrations on the pitch with his players who face Chelsea at home next week.
""We have 82 points now, that is massive in this crazy league and everyone is waiting for us. I am really proud. It is incredible,"" the German said.

(Reuters) - Ladbrokes owner GVC Holdings Plc on Friday posted an 8 percent growth in quarterly net gaming revenue, as strong online performance in sports and gaming bets offset retail weakness in Britain.
The company reported flat like-for-like retail revenue in the UK for the first quarter ended March 31, but online net gaming revenue rose 17 percent.
The company, Britain's largest high street bookmaker, has expanded through partnerships and of late has been focusing on the sports-betting and gaming opportunities in the United States.
GVC has weathered regulatory changes, including in the United States where the Justice Department had recently called for wider restrictions on gambling over the internet.
The company said it was confident of achieving its target of double-digit online growth in gaming revenue in 2019.
However, back home in Britain, restrictions on Fixed Odd Betting Terminals was expected to result in the closure of up to a 1,000 shops and impact GVC's 2019 core profit by about 135 million pounds ($176.6 million).
Fixed odds betting terminals are electronic machines in betting shops, which contain a variety of games, including roulette.
The new regulations were implemented in April and maximum betting was limited to 2 pounds ($2.62) from a 100 pounds in an effort to keep a check on problem gambling.
""We expect it to be several weeks before we can start to assess the impact,"" Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Alexander said in a statement.
However, the company, which offers sports betting, casino, poker and bingo and has licenses in over 20 countries, was confident of meeting the expectations for its overall full-year core and operating profit.
Shares of the former FTSE blue-chip component rose 1.9 percent to 594 pence in early trading.

BERLIN — A post-game party organised by defender Jerome Boateng is causing quite a stir at Bayern Munich and the champions are hoping they will have something to celebrate after Saturday's crunch Bundesliga match against title rivals Borussia Dortmund.
The Bavarians, who have won the last six league titles, are two points behind Dortmund after their surprise 1-1 draw at Freiburg last week.
They almost slipped up again in the German Cup on Wednesday, squandering leads of 1-0 and 4-2 against second-tier Heidenheim before snatching a 5-4 victory to move into the last four.
""We need to forget it and delete it,"" said Bayern sports director Hasan Salihamidzic of the Cup game. ""We have a very important game coming up.
""Such games make you think, but we have to focus on Saturday because it is a very important game and we have a lot to do until then.""
Victory over Dortmund would put Bayern back in front in the title race while defeat would leave them five points adrift with six matches remaining. Dortmund are on 63 points, with Bayern on 61.
Coupled with their round of 16 Champions League exit to Liverpool, failure to win the league would be mark a hugely disappointing season for the success-spoilt Bavarians.
Win, lose or draw on Saturday, Bayern's players plan to party at an exclusive Munich nightclub at an event organised by Boateng.
Informed of Saturday's party plans by reporters, Salihamidzic said he hoped the players would not be distracted.
""I do not want to interfere in the private life of players but all our focus should be on football,"" he added.
""As a player I would not do it because you do not yet know what the result will be. I hope we play a game but had he asked me I would have advised against it.""
Bayern's central defence has been one of the reasons for their erratic season and conceding four against a second division club after central defender Niklas Suele was sent off will do nothing to boost their confidence.
Dortmund have recovered from their slump in the past two months, earning last-gasp victories in their last two matches.
But their top scorer Paco Alcacer, who struck twice in stoppage-time last week to beat VfL Wolfsburg 2-0, is doubtful after injuring his arm.
""It is difficult to say now who can play on Saturday. The chance is still there for him to play,"" Dortmund coach Lucien Favre said. ""We will have to wait until tomorrow.""
Dortmund could also be without defenders Abdou Diallo and Lukasz Piszczek. A decision will be made after the last training session on Friday.
Dortmund will be without defender Achraf Hakimi and Favre played down the importance of the game.
""Nothing will be decided if we win,"" he said. ""Nothing will be decided if we draw and even if we lose everything is still possible.""

WASHINGTON — Bradley Beal became the first player in Washington Wizards franchise history to average at least 25 points, five rebounds and five assists for a season, reaching the numbers he needed in a 116-110 loss to the playoff-bound Boston Celtics in a finale Tuesday night that was meaningless to both clubs.
Eliminated a while ago and bound for the draft lottery, the Wizards wound up 32-50, their most losses since going 29-53 in 2012-13. Team president Ernie Grunfeld was fired last week after 16 years in charge.
John Wall and Dwight Howard both missed most of the season with injuries.
Beal, a two-time All-Star, finished with 16 points, five rebounds and four assists — all before halftime — on Tuesday as he played in all 82 games for the second consecutive season.
The Celtics already were assured of finishing as the No. 4 team in the Eastern Conference and facing the No. 5-seeded Indiana Pacers in the first round of the playoffs. They finished 49-33.
So there was no reason for Boston to care about the outcome Tuesday — or, therefore, use any of its best players.
Seven prominent members of the roster were ruled out: Kyrie Irving, Jayson Tatum, Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Marcus Smart, Aron Baynes and Marcus Morris. That group includes six of the top seven Celtics in scoring and assists, the club's six leading rebounders.
The starting lineup was Jaylen Brown, Terry Rozier, Semi Ojeleye, Guerschon Yabusele and Robert Williams. Ojele, Yabusele and Williams had a combined three starts this season before Tuesday.
TIP-INS
Celtics: Rozier scored 21 points. ... Signed G Jonathan Gibson. He played four games for Boston last season. ""He gets buckets,"" coach Brad Stevens said.
Wizards: Tomas Satoransky scored 19 points. ... Signed Gs Jordan McRae and Tarik Phillip. McRae was on a two-way contract this season, when he averaged 5.9 points, 1.5 rebounds and 1.1 assists in 27 games for the Wizards and led the NBA G League in scoring at 30.4 ppg for the Capital City Go-Go. Phillip played for the Memphis Hustle in the G League.
WALL SPEAKS
Wizards PG Wall says he is not sure whether he will be able to play next season as he recovers from a torn Achilles tendon. ""I have no idea just yet,"" Wall told reporters at halftime. ""That's my goal.""
STEVENS ON VIRGINIA, BENNETT
Stevens, who led Butler to two runner-up finishes in the NCAA Tournament, was asked for his reaction to seeing coach Tony Bennett and Virginia go from last year's disaster — the first No. 1 seed to lose to a 16 — to this year's championship. ""One of the coolest things I think I've seen in sports was Tony Bennett's reaction when they got beat last year and the way that he handled it,"" Stevens said. ""And then to back that up with the year they had ... and for all those kids and for him and for everybody associated with the program to win all those games in the fashion that they did. ... Tony is a good friend and I am thrilled for him and for college basketball. I think he's about all the good stuff.""
UP NEXT:
Celtics: Game 1 of their first-round series against the Pacers will be in Boston; day and time to be announced.
Wizards: Season over. Time for a GM search and a rebuild.

CHELSEA 2 WEST HAM UNITED 0
Eden Hazard's stunning individual performance earned Chelsea a 2-0 win over West Ham United which hoisted them into third spot in the Premier League on Monday.
The Belgian wizard tormented West Ham throughout and scored both goals to move Chelsea above Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal in the race for a top-four finish.
Hazard danced through West Ham's packed defence in the 24th minute to put Maurizio Sarri's side in front and Gonzalo Higuain should have buried the visitors before halftime.
West Ham improved after the break and Manuel Lanzini and Felipe Anderson both had good chances to equalise but Hazard sealed the points in the 90th minute with a clinical finish.
A third successive victory means Chelsea have 66 points from 33 games, while Tottenham and Arsenal have 64 and 63 respectively having played a game less.
West Ham are 11th with 42 points from 33 games.
Hazard was in a class of his own, giving the Stamford Bridge faithful another example of why they are so desperate to avoid him moving on at the end of the season -- a fact not lost on West Ham's fans who chanted that about Real Madrid's interest.
The 28-year-old's masterful brace means he now has 19 goals in all competitions this season -- equalling his previous best for Chelsea in 2014-15.
His opener was a contender for goal of the season, taking on half of West Ham's team single-handedly.
Taking possession of the ball 35 metres from goal with a blanket of West Ham players blocking his path to goal, Hazard first accelerated into the area past Declan Rice and Mark Noble.
Then, as Fabian Balbuena and Angelo Ogbonna converged to try and stop him, he left both tackling thin air and with Ryan Fredericks desperately trying to cover he remained perfectly balanced to smash a left-footed shot past Lukasz Fabianski.
""It was something special. I took the ball and then I tried to move forward. In the box it was hard for the defender to challenge me because if he touches me it could be a penalty,"" Hazard told Sky Sports after a near-perfect display.
""I was maybe a little lucky with the shot. I wanted to shoot quickly. When I saw the ball in the net I was just so happy. I am small so it is good when I play against tall players as it's very hard for them to change direction.""
Higuain thumped a shot against the woodwork minutes later as Chelsea threatened to run riot and the Argentine was denied again by a timely block shortly before halftime.
West Ham offered more threat in a much more evenly-balanced second half and both Felipe Anderson and Manuel Lanzini had good chances to equalise while Marco Arnautovic headed just wide.
It was left to Hazard to seal the points.
This time he collected Ross Barkley's ball over the top and before West Ham's defence could close him down, he fired a shot across Fabianski into the far corner.

(Reuters) - Arsenal's hopes of a top-four finish in the Premier League were dented on Sunday as Everton captain Phil Jagielka took advantage of an unexpected late recall to score the winner in a dominant 1-0 victory at Goodison Park.
The veteran defender, who was brought into the team for a rare appearance after Michael Keane had to withdraw in the warm-up through illness, scored after 10 minutes to earn his side a well-deserved third straight league win.
It marked a significant setback for disappointing Arsenal, who remain fourth in the table but missed an opportunity to leap ahead of their third-placed north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur.
Unai Emery's side stay on 63 points, one behind Spurs, level with fifth-placed Chelsea and two clear of Manchester United in an increasingly tight battle for the Champions League berths.
The experienced Jagielka proved Everton's unlikely hero after his late call-up, becoming the oldest goalscorer in the league this season at 36 years 233 days when he poked home his finish after Arsenal failed to clear Lucas Digne's long throw.
The ball had fallen kindly after Dominic Calvert-Lewin got the final touch on to him in the aerial battle, allowing Jagielka to score his first league goal in two years and become Everton's second-oldest marksman in the Premier League era.
""I'm not normally a match-winner, full stop,"" laughed the former England defender on Sky Sports. ""They're the best goals, the little tap-ins from two or three yards.""
His goal signalled a hungry and aggressive display from Everton who, while moving up to ninth on 46 points, could have won far more convincingly if Gylfi Sigurdsson and Richarlison had converted any of the side's 23 attempts on goal.
""We got one goal but could have scored a few more,"" added Jagielka.
He earned special praise from delighted Everton manager Marco Silva, who told the BBC: ""He was to start on the bench, but showed how he is a good professional and prepares himself for what the coach and team needs. He is always ready to help the team.""
Arsenal, who have conceded at least one goal in every league away match this season, came closest with one curling second-half effort from Henrikh Mkhitaryan but were outplayed and outfought by Silva's team.
They had only two attempts on target in the whole match and, with Mesut Ozil failing to offer much inspiration as captain for the day, endured one of their more frustrating lacklustre away days.
Arsenal's frustration became obvious when the two managers were involved in a brief confrontation in the second half.
""The football is emotional. He wants the best for his team, I want the best for mine. At the end we spoke together and everything is normal,"" said Silva.
Arsenal boss Emery felt his team would have to rebound swiftly as they prepared to face Napoli in a Europa League quarter-final first leg on Thursday.
""It was not a good result today but we are still fourth,"" said the Spaniard. ""We lost and we need to get up quickly and find the next step.""

Texas Longhorns freshman Jaxson Hayes has declared for the NBA draft and will hire an agent, the school announced Thursday.
""I have always dreamed about playing in the NBA. Now that I have the chance to realize that dream, I would like to pursue that opportunity,"" Hayes said in a statement.
The 6-foot-11 forward averaged 10 points and 5.0 rebounds in his only season with the Longhorns. He started 21 of 32 games and shot 72.8 percent from the floor.
The Big 12 Freshman of the Year is a potential lottery pick, according to several draft outlets. ESPN ranks him as the No. 9 prospect.
--LSU freshman guard Javonte Smart announced on social media that he will enter the draft, joining teammates Naz Reid, Skylar Mays and Tremont Waters.
Smart averaged 11.1 points, 3.3 rebounds and 2.4 assists in his lone year in Baton Rouge.
LSU sat Smart for the regular-season finale following the suspension of coach Will Wade over allegations he was linked to the NCAA's pay-for-play scandal. It has been speculated that Wade was part of a scheme to pay to gain Smart's commitment to LSU.
--Stanford sophomore guard KZ Okpala announced he is entering the NBA draft.
The first-team all-Pac-12 selection averaged a team-high 16.9 points with 5.7 rebounds in 29 games for the Cardinal in 2018-19. He scored a career-high 30 points in an 84-81 win at Cal on Feb. 3.
""It's exciting to apply what I have learned so far as I begin this journey and see where it takes me,"" said Okpala, who is ranked No. 26 on ESPN's list of the top 100 draft prospects.
--Houston guard Armoni Brooks will declare for the NBA draft and test the process, Stadium sports network reported.
Brooks, a 6-foot-3, 195-pound junior, averaged 13.4 points and a team-leading 6.3 rebounds per game this season for the Cougars, who finished 33-4 and lost to Kentucky in the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament. Brooks scored 20 points in the defeat.
As a sophomore in 2017-18, he was named American Athletic Conference Sixth Man of the Year.
""Armoni is somebody who has had tangible progress every year,"" assistant coach Kellen Sampson told the Houston Chronicle during the NCAA Tournament. ""Every year he made marked improvement to figure out how to rebound or on how to make some plays for himself. He's on a natural progression. He is a really good player, but he's finding his way to becoming that best player next year. He will be at the top of scouting reports.""
--Duke freshman forward Cam Reddish announced on Instagram that he is declaring for the NBA draft, and a school spokeman confirmed he will hire an agent.
""This season was epic, and I am so thankful to have had Duke as a part of the foundation that prepared me to play at the next level,"" Reddish wrote. ""Never forget -- I am a Blue Devil for life. Proud to announce that I will be entering the 2019 NBA Draft.""
The 6-8 Reddish averaged 13.5 points, 3.7 rebounds and 29.7 minutes per game for the Blue Devils, who lost 68-67 to Michigan State in the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament. After fellow freshman RJ Barrett announced his intentions Wednesday to enter the draft, only Zion Williamson remains among Duke's Big Three to declare.

PHOENIX — Mitch Moreland homered off Merrill Kelly on the first pitch of the seventh inning, and the World Series champion Boston Red Sox ended an awful opening trip with a 1-0 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks on Sunday.
Boston went 3-8 against Seattle, Oakland and Arizona, its worst start since losing nine of 11 to begin a 2011 season that ended with a third-place finish in the AL East at 90-72. The last team to reach the postseason after losing at least eight its first 11 games was Tampa Bay, which finished 91-71 in 2011.
The Red Sox host Toronto on Tuesday, their first game at Fenway Park since winning the World Series at Dodger Stadium last October, their fourth title in 15 years.
Hector Velázquez, Brandon Workman, Marcus Walden (1-0), Matt Barnes and Ryan Brasier combined on a three-hitter and Boston's first shutout this season. The Red Sox entered with a 6.97 ERA, ahead of only the Chicago White Sox at 7.87.
Walden, a 30-year-old right-hander who made his debut on April 1 last year, got six outs for his first major league victory. Boston stopped a three-game losing streak in the finale of the longest opening trip in franchise history.
Brasier allowed David Peralta's two-out double in the ninth, then got his second save when Andruw Jones grounded out, finishing a game that took just 2 hours, 29 minutes.
Boston had vocal support in a crowd of 31,565. Many booed when J.D. Martinez was intentionally walked with first base open and two outs in the ninth.
Moreland's third homer was just out of the reach of Jones, who leaped and stretched his glove over the right-field fence but could not come down with the ball.
Kelly (1-1) gave up four hits in eight innings, struck out nine and walked one.
Velázquez gave up one hit in three innings and threw 39 pitches, working entirely from the stretch. He made his first start after three relief appearances.
Arizona had its best scoring chance in the fifth inning, when Christian Walker doubled leading off and advanced on Ketel Marte's groundout but was thrown out at the plate by shortstop Xander Bogaerts on Nick Ahmed's grounder.
Boston loaded the bases with two outs in the ninth before Blake Swihart struck out against Jon Duplantier.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Diamondbacks: C Alex Avila was placed on the injured list after straining his left quadriceps while circling the bases on a home run Friday. IF/OF Tim Locastro was recalled from Triple-A Reno to take the roster spot.
Red Sox: 2B Dustin Pedroia (left knee) was 0 for 4 with a walk while playing nine innings for Class A Greenville on Sunday and is to meet the Red Sox in Boston on Monday, manager Alex Cora said. Pedroia was 3 for 9 with a double and two walks in three injury rehabilitation games.
UP NEXT
Red Sox: LHP Chris Sale (0-2) is to start Tuesday against Toronto's Matt Shoemaker (2-0) in the last scheduled homer opener in the major leagues this season.
Diamondbacks: RHP Zack Greinke (1-1) starts Tuesday against Texas and LHP Mike Minor (1-1) in the opener of a two-game series. Greinke hit two homers and pitched six innings to win 8-5 at San Diego last Wednesday.

Chris Mullin stepped down as St. John's head coach on Tuesday, with speculation falling on Arizona State coach Bobby Hurley as his replacement.
""This has been an extremely emotional decision, but after a recent personal loss, I took time to reflect upon my true values and believe this is the right time to make a change,"" Mullin said in a statement issued by the school. ""I am extremely grateful to the administration, which has supported me and our basketball program on every level.
""I've been amazed by our coaches, trainers, managers and staff who work relentless hours, which enables this team to grow and thrive. I've been honored to coach the young men who are the heart and soul of this program. It's a job I will always cherish.""
Mullin's older brother, Rod, died from cancer in early March.
Athletic director Mike Cragg issued a statement thanking Mullin.
""St. John's basketball progressed well during his tenure, culminating with a trip to the NCAA Tournament this past season. Coach Mullin has a deep passion for this program and he has been committed to helping our student-athletes achieve their goals on and off the court, so I know this was not an easy decision. We wish him and his family nothing but the best as he begins this new chapter of his life.""
Mullin went 59-73 at his alma mater, taking the Red Storm to one NCAA Tournament -- this season's First Four, where they lost to Hurley's Sun Devils. Hurley is ""expected to be at the top of St. John's list"" of replacements, according to a Sunday report from Jon Rothstein of CBS Sports.
Hurley is a New Jersey native and has a background with Cragg, who spent more than 30 years in various administrative roles at Duke, his time intersecting with Hurley's playing days with the Blue Devils from 1989-93.
Rick Pitino told the New York Post on Tuesday that he would be interested in the job, but he wants an apology and to be cleared publicly by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. Louisville fired Pitino in September 2017, in part because the government alleged Pitino was part of a play-for-pay scandal involving five-star recruit Brian Bowen.
Pitino has maintained his innocence. Now coaching in Greece, he denied to the Post that he reached out to St. John's on Monday.
""I think the AD is a Duke man and Bobby Hurley was a great Duke player, and I think he would be an excellent choice,"" Pitino said.
Hurley is 73-58 in four seasons at Arizona State and 115-78 in six years as a college head coach, including two years at Buffalo.
Mullin, a Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame member, holds the St. John's record of 2,440 points, set from 1981 to 1985. He went on to a 16-year NBA career in which he was a five-time All-Star.
St. John's went 21-13 this season but last week lost its top recruiter, Matt Abdelmassih, who joined new Nebraska coach Fred Hoiberg. The Red Storm's best player, junior guard Shamorie Ponds (19.7 points, 5.1 assists, 4.1 rebounds, 2.6 steals), has announced that he will enter the NBA draft.
The departures continued after Tuesday's announcement. Junior guard Justin Simon (10.4 points per game) hired an agent and announced he was entering the NBA draft, while backup guard Bryan Trimble Jr. has entered his name into the NCAA transfer portal, a source told ESPN.

AUGUSTA, Ga. — Tiger Woods won't be the only big winner if he finishes on top of the leaderboard at the Masters.
A bettor in Las Vegas will pocket nearly $1.2 million if Woods wins the Masters for the first time since 2005.
The unidentified gambler placed an $85,000 wager on Woods on Tuesday to win the Masters. The bet was made at 14-1 odds, meaning the bettor will walk away with $1,190,000 if Woods wins.
The bet made at the William Hill sports book chain represents the largest liability for an individual golf wager in the company's U.S. history.
Rory McIlroy is the betting favorite for the Masters, listed as a 7-1 pick at William Hill. Dustin Johnson is at 10-1, followed by Woods and Justin Rose.
The longest odds in the field? Bettors can win $20,000 on a $10 bet if Viktor Hovland somehow wins the green jacket. Hovland, a Norwegian amateur who plays at Oklahoma State, is listed at 2,000-1.
SIGN HERE, PLEASE
The story of Brooks Koepka coming to the Masters as a kid and failing to get an autograph from Phil Mickelson in the parking lot at Augusta National has turned into a running joke. He first told Mickelson the story when they played a practice round together at the 2014 British Open.
""I was like, 'Listen, man, you stiffed me, and I really didn't like you for a long time,'"" Koepka said Tuesday, calling himself ""probably the only kid Phil's ever turned down.""
""And he told me years later,"" Koepka added, ""I shouldn't have been in the parking lot, so fair enough.""
""Yeah, well, he shouldn't have been there,"" Mickelson confirmed, when asked about the episode. ""I think I told him that, too.""
Not content to let the story die there, Koepka said he finally got Mickelson's autograph, sending reporters back to Mickelson to find out if he had Koepka's as well.
""A bunch,"" Mickelson smirked. Asked as a follow-up whether the request was made in a parking lot, Lefty chuckled, ""I did it in the appropriate location.""
OR JUST SIGN OVER YOUR FIRST-BORN
The secondary ticket market for this year's tournament is sizzling.
A one-day entry for Wednesday's final practice round — with a face value of $75 — were being offered for $2,500 and up on StubHub and Vivid Seats. Rain, accompanied by occasional flashes of lightning, prompted Masters officials to cut practice sessions on Monday and Tuesday in half and may have contributed to driving up prices. Those who don't want to buy them online often take their chances with scalpers.
Although Augusta National prohibits the resale of tickets, it's not against state law. So scalpers remain a familiar site on Washington Road near the club during Masters week — provided they don't conduct business closer than 2,700 feet of a venue.
""We have people that will push the boundaries from time to time,"" said Capt. Scott Gay of the Richmond County Sheriff's Office. ""Typically, who we have the most problems with are just people being uneducated about the state law.""
WHICH WAY TO THE PRO SHOP?
Players who cave in the face of their drivers or whose shaft breaks against a tree trying to play a shot at the Masters can now replace the club.
The USGA and R&A on Tuesday provided a clarification to Rule 4.1b that allows for a local rule that allows players to replace a broken or significantly damaged club, except in cases of abuse.
That's a change from the new Rules of Golf and it's aimed primarily at the elite level of golf.
Under the new rules, players could still use damaged clubs for the rest of the round, but they couldn't replace them.
The local rule defines ""broken or significantly damaged"" if the shaft breaks in pieces, splinters or is bent (but not when it is only dented); the club is visibly deformed, detached or loose from the shaft, or the grip is loose.
The governing bodies made it clear, however, that players can't replace a club — primarily the driver — if there is a crack or a scratch.

AUGUSTA, Ga. — No fewer than 11 players were churned through the Masters press center for interviews at the Masters on Tuesday on such a relentless conveyor belt that it became difficult to keep up with who dropped what cliche.
Rory McIlroy was earnest as usual, Tiger Woods relaxed and Dustin Johnson so obviously bored as he ran out the clock on his semi-obligatory 25-minute interview session.
Some sports, such as tennis, fine players for refusing interview requests, but not so in golf.
Augusta National does not need to be so heavy-handed. Its importance in the eyes of players, and the aura in which the club is held, is such that when asked to go to the media center they wouldn't dream of declining.
Woods is almost as deft with his handling of the media as with a wedge in his hand, having long ago mastered the art of saying as little as possible, but in a very eloquent, articulate manner.
The four-times Masters champion was the only player to almost fill the interview room, showing that he is still ""the man"", even 14 years removed from last Augusta victory.
There was even a ripple of applause when the 14-times major champion entered, a definite breach of protocol on behalf of the press.
He flashed his patented smile and put on his game face. As usual he did not let his mask drop.
Woods is happy to talk all day about the flex specifications of his shafts and related technical matters, but hit him with a question on his off-course life and one can expect the Tiger stare.
Last year, in the wake of his arrest upon being found asleep at the wheel of his car, he was asked at the U.S. Open how his life had improved since then.
""It's gotten better,"" he said curtly.
But if Woods had any concern that he would be hit with some uncomfortable questions on Tuesday, he need not have worried.
Among other things, he was asked about the logo on his shirt, his popularity with fans and his thoughts on the inaugural Augusta National Women's Amateur.
To be fair, he was also questioned about how surprised he was at not having won a major championship in more than a decade.
""I wouldn't have foreseen that, for sure,"" he said.
In contrast to the packed house for Woods, more than half the seats were empty when Rory McIlroy entered the room a little later, never mind that the Northern Irishman is the tournament favorite.
McIlroy is not nearly as guarded as Woods, even willing to speak about his mental approach to the game and life in general, a subject Woods would invariably shut down immediately.
Happy to reveal a list of the books he had read recently, something Woods would regard as a state secret, he cited among others ""Ego is the Enemy"" by Ryan Holiday.
JOHNSON ECONOMICAL WITH WORDS
Later on came Johnson, who doesn't dislike the press as much as he is bored by the whole thing, almost bemused as to why anyone would care about his thoughts.
But Johnson can be funny with his economy of words.
Asked what it was like playing with noted slowpoke Bryson DeChambeau, he deadpanned: ""It takes a long time.""
They will be in the same threesome on Thursday and Friday.
Another thing about news conferences is that everyone has their own agenda, which means questions can veer from topic to topic violently enough to cause whiplash.
One writer working a particular angle asked most every player about the ban on smartphones at Augusta National.
There was unanimous agreement that it was a nice change.
""Wonderful, isn't it,"" said McIlroy, who revealed he is reading a book called ""Digital Minimalism"".
""How good is it that people aren't looking at their phones.""
If it had been any other tournament, reporters would have been looking at their phones as McIlroy spoke.
But such devices are banned from the interview room as well as the course, which means tweeting of the interview would have to wait.

Chicago Cubs ace Jon Lester will be placed on the 10-day injured list Tuesday and miss ""one, maybe two"" starts with a hamstring strain, manager Joe Maddon announced Tuesday.
The left-hander got hurt while running the bases during the Cubs' six-run second inning Monday in Chicago's home opener against the Pittsburgh Pirates. He doubled home a run and later scored from second base on a single by Ben Zobrist.
""Sometimes when you have elite speed, these things can happen,"" Lester said Tuesday in a tongue-in-cheek message on Twitter.
Lester, 35, is 1-0 with a 2.57 ERA in three starts this season. The five-time All-Star is 178-98 with a 3.49 ERA in 14 major league seasons.
--The Cleveland Indians placed right-handed starter Mike Clevinger on the 10-day injured list, but he will be out for much longer.
Clevinger sustained a right upper back/Teres major muscle strain during his Sunday start. Manager Terry Francona called the injury ""fairly significant"" and told reporters it could be six to eight weeks ""before we're even looking at him picking up a ball.""
Clevinger (1-0) has not allowed a run in two starts this season while striking out 22 in 12 innings. He left the Sunday game after five innings.
--Pittsburgh right-hander Chris Archer, Cincinnati outfielder Yasiel Puig and Reds manager David Bell received suspensions for their roles in a bench-clearing brawl Sunday.
Archer received a five-game suspension for intentionally throwing a fastball behind the back of Derek Dietrich during the fourth inning in Pittsburgh. In his first at-bat, Dietrich had dropped his bat and stood to admire his towering 436-foot home run.
Puig drew a two-game suspension for ""his aggressive actions during the incident,"" the league said in a statement. Bell, who raced onto the field to argue that Archer should have been ejected, received a one-game suspension for his actions.
--Former New York Mets outfielder Lenny Dykstra has sued ex-teammate Ron Darling, alleging defamation over comments Darling made about him in his new book.
TMZ Sports reported that the lawsuit was filed in New York. Dykstra wants Darling to pay damages for ""defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress.""
Darling has stood by an allegation he made in his book that Dykstra shouted racial slurs at Boston Red Sox pitcher Dennis ""Oil Can"" Boyd in the 1986 World Series. Darling wrote that the insults were ""worse than anything Jackie Robinson might have heard.""
--The Boston Red Sox reinstated second baseman Dustin Pedroia from the injured list ahead of the team's home opener against the Toronto Blue Jays.
The club optioned infielder Tzu-Wei Lin to make room for Pedroia on the active roster. Pedroia started and went 1-for-4.
Pedroia, 35, began the season on the IL while battling inflammation in his surgically repaired left knee. He played in just three games in 2018 with 13 plate appearances. Before Tuesday, his most recent major league game was May 29, 2018, against the Blue Jays.
--The Washington Nationals reached an agreement with right-handed reliever Bud Norris on a minor league deal, pending results of a physical, according to The Athletic.
Norris, 34, spent spring training with the Toronto Blue Jays, posting a 9.00 ERA in three innings before injuring his forearm and getting released on April 2.
Norris spent the 2018 season in the St. Louis Cardinals' bullpen, going 3-6 with 28 saves and a 3.59 ERA in 64 appearances.
--A Texas woman has sued the Houston Astros for more than $1 million, contending her left index finger was injured permanently last summer when the team mascot shot a giveaway shirt in her direction using a ""T-shirt cannon.""
Jennifer Harughty said she was sitting behind third base last July 8 when the mascot, Orbit, launched a T-shirt at close range, resulting in a broken finger.
""It was a life-changing event that I think if it happened to anybody else ... they would feel the same way,"" Harughty told KTRK-TV in Houston.

The New York Giants are finalizing a four-year, $41 million contract extension with wide receiver Sterling Shepard, NFL Network reported Wednesday.
The deal includes $21.3 million in guaranteed money, according to ESPN.
Shepard, a second-round pick out of Oklahoma in 2016, set career highs last season with 66 catches for 872 yards. He has started 42 of his 43 games with the Giants, catching 190 passes for 2,286 yards and 14 touchdowns.
The Giants also re-signed wide receiver Russell Shepard (no relation), who confirmed the news on social media.
--Meanwhile, the Giants hosted former New York Jets cornerback Morris Claiborne and former Los Angeles Chargers defensive tackle Corey Liuget on free agent visits, ESPN reported.
A former first-round pick of the Dallas Cowboys, the 29-year-old Claiborne started 30 games over the last two seasons for the Jets, breaking up 22 passes and making three interceptions.
Liuget, 29, was released by the Chargers earlier this offseason. He has 24 career sacks since being drafted in the first round in 2011, though just three since 2015. He missed 10 games last season due to a suspension and a knee injury.
--Projected top-five NFL draft pick Nick Bosa admitted in an interview with ESPN that he has scrubbed his Twitter account clean of anything that could be considered political.
Bosa, a former Ohio State defensive end, frequently had tweeted his support for President Donald Trump, and he also criticized former San Francisco 49ers quarterback-turned-social activist Colin Kaepernick.
However, knowing he could wind up in a liberal city, such as San Francisco, where the 49ers hold the No. 2 pick, he chose to clean the slate.
--At least three more quarterbacks reportedly are visiting this week with the Washington Redskins, who hold the No. 15 pick in this month's draft.
NFL Network said Duke's Daniel Jones, Ohio State's Dwayne Haskins and Northwestern's Clayton Thorson all have meetings scheduled with the Redskins, who have already hosted Missouri's Drew Lock and Auburn's Jarrett Stidham.
Jones will visit Wednesday night and Thursday, Thorson meets with the team Wednesday, and Haskins is due sometime this week, according to NFL Network. West Virginia's Will Grier is also expected at Redskins Park in the coming days, according to NBC Sports Washington.
--Free agent tight end Austin Seferian-Jenkins signed a contract with the New England Patriots. Terms were not announced, but multiple outlets reported it's a one-year deal for the veteran minimum.
The team also confirmed the re-signing of kicker Stephen Gostkowski.
Meanwhile, ESPN reported the Patriots brought in former Broncos and Texans wide receiver Demaryius Thomas and former Jaguars running back T.J. Yeldon for free agent visits.
--The Jets signed former Alliance of American Football quarterback Brandon Silvers, the team announced.
Silvers, 24, started three games for the Memphis Express and passed for 777 yards, four touchdowns and one interception. In four seasons at Troy from 2014-17, Silvers passed for 10,677 yards with 71 TDs and 29 picks.
The Jets also brought former Chiefs running back Spencer Ware in for a visit and will host former Packers and Ravens running back Ty Montgomery on a visit on Thursday, ESPN reported.
--The Buffalo Bills signed former Lions and 49ers defensive end Eli Harold to a one-year deal.
Harold, 25, had a career-high four sacks along with five quarterback hits in 13 games as a reserve last season for the Lions, who acquired him from the 49ers late in training camp.
A third-round pick in 2015, Harold has nine career sacks in 61 games (25 starts).
--The Dallas Cowboys released guard Parker Ehinger and defensive tackle Aziz Shittu.
Ehinger, 26, was acquired from the Chiefs in a trade during training camp last year, but he sustained a season-ending knee injury less than a week later and missed the whole season. He started four games in 2016 and one in 2017 with Kansas City.
Shittu, 24, was on and off the Cowboys' practice squad last season. He has not appeared in a regular-season NFL game.

Close your eyes and try to imagine your wedding proposal.
If you think you’re not really the marrying type, then imagine an alternative proposal — asking someone on a date or to the prom? (Did you know there was such a thing as a
promposal
?)
What did you see: a beautiful setting? Candles? Rose petals? Are you down on one knee? Is there a ring?
Now add 50,000 cheering people to your fantasy. Would that make the moment more special?
Does the idea of a Jumbotron proposal fill you with romantic delight or deep, cringy fear? (You can watch two examples
here
and
here
.)
In “
Thinking of a Jumbotron Proposal? Some Say, Ugh. Others, Say Yes.
,” Britni de la Cretaz writes:
Jumbotron proposals have become as much a part of baseball as the seventh-inning stretch — no matter that they are often considered tacky and in bad taste.
When a proposal appears on the giant screen, a large segment of sports Twitter world (mostly women) chime in about how they hope no one ever proposes to them at a sporting event. Still, hundreds of these public, grandiose gestures happen every year and many proposees walk out of the stadium happily ever after.
On March 31, 2018, Joanna Chan, who works for Netflix, proposed to her girlfriend of five years, Julie Morris, who is employed at Hulu. The moment happened during the first period of a Calgary Flames game and was shown on the giant screen at Scotiabank Saddledome — known as the Enmax Energy Board — home to the National Hockey League’s Flames.
Ms. Chan and Ms. Morris, both 36 and living in Los Angeles (since married and now both going by Chan-Morris), had just embarked on a five-year tour of all 31 N.H.L. arenas, and the Saddledome was their final stop.
Joanna Chan-Morris says that a few stops before their final one, she knew she wanted to propose in Calgary. “It’s not about the public aspect of the proposal, really,” she said. “It was really just about making that last game special.”
Even still, with that gesture, their engagement became a viral sensation, traveling beyond the area and onto the internet. Joanna paid 5,000 Canadian dollars ($3,782) for the opportunity, which she says was “worth every penny.”
The Saddledome is far from the only sports arena that gives fans the option to propose on a really big TV screen in front of thousands. Fenway Park, home of the Boston Red Sox, does 50 to 60 live, in-game proposals each season at a cost of $350 each. At Dodger Stadium, getting engaged onscreen will set you back $5,000, an event the team estimates happens two or three times a season.
The article continues:
The whole concept irks Jessica Kleinschmidt, a content producer/reporter at NBC Sports Bay Area and a self-proclaimed “hater of in-game proposals.”
“It’s as if this person
needs
to show these complete strangers they love this person by making a show out of it,” Ms. Kleinschmidt said. “Needing validation from complete strangers? Go on Twitter if you want to do that.”
Also, she noted, an in-game proposal “puts the woman under pressure to say yes.”
When those traditional gender dynamics are reversed, the public response can be cruel.
In 2014, a woman surprised her boyfriend by proposing to him at an N.B.A. game. At the time, she told Fox 5 DC, “I thought this would make me the best wife-to-be ever to do it in front of his favorite team.” Her fiancé seemed happy she asked. But the response online was less than kind, with the frequently misogynist sports and culture website Barstool Sports calling it “the absolute worst proposal of all time,” among other worse things.
Another blogger
wrote that he would “never want to be proposed to by my girlfriend, and at an N.B.A. game no less, not in a million years.”
When Jumbotron proposals go wrong, spectators take an almost perverse pleasure in the rejection. In 2017, a rejected proposal at Fenway Park resulted in
the entire ballpark chanting
, “She said no!” (Jasmine Guillory’s newest novel, aptly named “The Proposal,”
opens with a rejected proposal
at Dodger Stadium that goes viral on the internet.)
This virality is something that more and more Jumbotron proposers are experiencing now that social media is a thing and everyone in the stadium has a smartphone, or the teams broadcast feel-good content across their various platforms.
What is it about our culture’s ideas about love, romance and marriage that allowed the phenomenon to gain traction in the first place? “Romantic comedies,”
Chloe Angyal wrote for Buzzfeed
in 2015, “teach us that the truer a true love is, the grander and more public the public grand gesture will be.”
Students, read the entire article, then tell us:
— What do you think about Jumbotron proposals? Would you like to receive or make one yourself? Why or why not? Did the article change your views on these over-the-top proposals?
— What are the best Jumbotron or public proposals you’ve ever seen or heard of, whether live or online? Do you find them charming and delightful, or do they make you uncomfortable? Do you ever watch Jumbotron proposal fails for fun? If yes, why?
— Do you know if one of your parents proposed or not? Is there a story that went with it?
— What would be your ideal marriage proposal? Would you want to be proposed to in some elaborate way? Why or why not? What proposal ideas do you have? What dos and don’ts for success might you suggest? (You can look at some other creative proposals
here
.)
— If you hate the idea of a big fancy proposal, how do you feel about marriage itself? Do you ever think about it? Is a wedding proposal too old fashioned or simply too far in the future to imagine? Do you think we place too much emphasis on romantic gestures — rings, engagement parties, lavish weddings and the like?

A day after reports that he will have shoulder surgery to fix a torn labrum, Dallas Cowboys defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence confirmed Monday he expects to miss the preseason while recovering in hopes of playing in Week 1.
Fresh off reaching a five-year deal to remain in Dallas, Lawrence said on The Rich Eisen Show that he will undergo surgery on Wednesday after putting off the procedure while he sorted out his contract, reportedly worth $105 million.
Lawrence, 26, played through the injury in the 2018 season and led the Cowboys with 10.5 sacks. The two-time Pro Bowler has 25 sacks over the past two seasons, with no other Cowboy recording double digits over the same span.
In five seasons in Dallas, Lawrence has a combined 34 sacks and 200 tackles in 64 games (47 starts). The Cowboys selected the Boise State product in the second round of the 2014 NFL Draft.
--The Kansas City Chiefs have reached agreement with linebacker Jeremiah Attaochu, according to the sports agency SportsTrust that represents the 26-year-old.
Attaochu played his first four NFL seasons (2014-17) with the Chargers -- three in San Diego, one in Los Angeles -- so he is mighty familiar with the AFC West. He had 10 sacks in 38 games (13 starts) with the Chargers. Attaochu was originally picked in the second round of the 2014 NFL Draft by the Chargers.
He signed with the San Francisco 49ers as a free agent in March 2018 but didn't make the team and was released. The New York Jets picked up Attaochu two days later and he had two sacks in 11 games.
--The Arizona Cardinals re-signed defensive tackle Rodney Gunter to a one-year contract, the team announced.
Gunter reportedly made a free-agent visit to the Green Bay Packers last week. The 27-year-old Gunter established career highs of 44 tackles and 4.5 sacks last year in his fourth season with the Cardinals. He has 95 tackles and eight sacks in 64 career games (25 starts).
The Cardinals also announced that they signed two offensive linemen who played for the recently disbanded Alliance of American Football: Andrew Lauderdale (Arizona Hotshots) and Jeremiah Poutasi (Salt Lake City Stallions).
--The Carolina Panthers announced the signing of five players, highlighted by former Philadelphia Eagles defensive tackle Destiny Vaeao and four others with experience in the now-suspended Alliance of American Football.
Vaeao, 25, has played parts of three seasons with the Eagles since signing as an undrafted free agent out of Washington State in 2016. He was cut by the Eagles last October and was signed to the New York Jets practice squad the following month, but never saw regular-season action.
In addition, the Panthers added four others who played in the AAF. The group includes Rashad Ross, 29, who caught 36 passes for 583 yards (16.2 yards per catch) and a league-best seven touchdowns for the Arizona Hotshots. His signing initially was reported on Thursday.
--The Miami Dolphins have reached a one-year deal with former Cleveland Browns wide receiver Ricardo Louis, according to multiple reports.
A fourth-round pick by the Browns in 2016, the 6-foot-2, 215-pound Louis missed all of last season with a neck injury that he had surgically repaired before training camp.
The two seasons prior, Louis appeared in all 32 games with 12 starts, catching 45 passes for 562 yards. He also averaged 18.2 yards on nine kickoff returns as a rookie after running a 4.43-second 40-yard dash at the Combine.
--Former rugby player Christian Wade has been allocated to the Buffalo Bills as part of the NFL's International Player Pathway Program, the team announced.
The 5-foot-8, 190-pound Wade was a highly decorated rugby star in the United Kingdom, having played for the national team at the U16, U18 and U20 levels, as well as making the British and Irish Lions squad. He retired from the rugby union last year to pursue playing in the NFL.
Wade's 82 tries (touchdowns) in Premiership Rugby, mostly as a ballcarrier, is third all-time and he has been designated as a running back with the Bills.
Wade, 27, is one of seven international athletes from five countries who have been training in Florida with the goal of landing one of four placements among AFC East teams this offseason. He participated in a pro day last week, where he was timed at 4.53 seconds in the 40-yard dash.
The four clubs will be allowed to carry an extra player (91 total) during training camp and, should the player not make the final roster, will also receive an extra practice squad spot for the allotted player. However, those placed on the practice squad with the international player exemption will be ineligible to be activated during the season.

AUGUSTA, Ga. — Tiger Woods had the putting green pretty much to himself as storms approached Augusta National on Monday. As a handful of fans lingered to watch, he stroked the 5-footers that always seemed to go in during his prime.
It's been 14 years since enough went in to win on the fabled greens of Augusta National. Even more startling, it's been 11 years since Woods won a major of any kind.
His believers — and there are legions of them — are hopeful that might change this week, if only because optimism is always at its peak before the first tee shot is hit. The old Tiger may not be fully back, but the prevailing thought is there's enough of his greatness left to fit comfortably inside a green jacket come late Sunday afternoon.
Count Woods among the believers.
""I know I can play this golf course,"" he said. ""I've had some success here.""
Indeed he has, with four green jackets stitched with his name. That's a haul that by itself qualifies him as one of the greatest players ever, though it is two short of the collection won by Jack Nicklaus.
But it isn't what Woods or anyone else expected after he won his first four in just nine years. Nicklaus himself predicted that Woods would win 10 green jackets on his way to obliterating Nicklaus' record of 18 major championships.
The reasons Woods hasn't, of course, have been well documented over the years. But a victory in the Tour Championship last year not only showed he can still compete and win at the highest level but gave Woods some sorely needed confidence heading into the first major of the year.
""I think that winning at (the Tour Championship) confirmed to me that I could still win again,"" Woods said. ""You have to do it first in order to truly understand that you can do it.""
Indeed, whether he can do it at the place he first put his stamp on the game with a runaway victory at the age of 21 remains a question that Woods probably can't answer until he's done it.
He's 43 now, something that comes into focus when he removes his hat and his bald spot seems bigger than ever. That's ancient in most sports but not terribly out of place in a tournament Nicklaus won at the age of 46 in 1986.
As if to prove it wasn't a fluke, Nicklaus was contending for the lead on the weekend a dozen years later before settling for sixth place, a feat that was almost as remarkable as his sixth win.
Augusta National has changed since, lengthened first to make it Tiger-proof and then again when the green jackets running the place realized the new generation of players can all bomb the ball incredible distances.
But it still rewards those with a great short game and those who can putt the slippery greens under pressure. And that remains problematic for Woods, last seen on national television missing a short putt to lose to little-known Lucas Bjerregaard with a berth in the semifinals of the Dell Technologies Match Play tournament last month.
""I feel I can still putt,"" Woods said. ""The hardest part is I just can't practice like I used to. My back gets sore.""
Wear and tear is an issue for any older athlete, and Woods is no exception. Though finally able to swing freely after back surgery, he says he can't put the kind of time in on any part of his game that he once did.
But on Tuesday, he was at his usual spot at the end of the driving range, working his way through every club in the bag. He took his time between shots, and at one point put his club down and went to talk to Kevin Kisner a few spots away and then to look at Bryson DeChambeau hit shots with his single length irons.
Woods shares a prime late-morning tee time on Thursday, playing with Spain's John Rahm and China's Haotong Li, both of whom were a year old when Woods won his first pro tournament in Las Vegas in 1996.
With age, though, comes wisdom. And as Nicklaus showed in his late career performances, knowing where to play shots and where to miss them at Augusta National is half the puzzle of winning.
""I've got a pretty good little library in my head of how to play the course,"" Woods said.
That library will be open for business as Woods begins play in his 22nd Masters. He's not the favorite — Rory McIlroy has that honor — but he's in a group of players who are among the favorites.
Can he win? Of course, because even at 43 he's still got plenty of game to compete.
Will he win?
Well, there's a reason he's been spending a lot of time practicing 5-footers.

President Trump, reversing an agreement negotiated by the Obama administration, abruptly ended a deal between Major League Baseball and the Cuban Baseball Federation that had eased the path for players to compete in the United States without defecting from their country.
The Trump administration said that the deal constituted a violation of trade laws because the Cuban federation was part of the government in Havana — a departure from the previous administration’s stance.
In a letter to M.L.B.’s outside counsel, which was obtained by The New York Times, Nikole Thomas, the acting assistant director for licensing at the Office of Foreign Assets Control, outlined the U.S. government’s opposition to the deal, which stipulated that the Cuban federation would receive 25 percent of a player’s signing bonus for a minor league player and between 15 and 25 percent for a major league player.
The letter said that the O.F.A.C. had “determined that M.L.B.’s payments to the Cuban Baseball Federation are not authorized” because “a payment to the Cuban Baseball Federation is a payment to the Cuban government.”
News of the administration’s rejection of M.L.B.’s plan was first reported by The Wall Street Journal and ESPN.
Cuban sports entities, including its baseball federation and Olympic committee, have argued they are independent of the central government, but the Trump administration rejected that assessment.
“The U.S. does not support actions that would institutionalize a system by which a Cuban government entity garnishes the wages of hard-working athletes who simply seek to live and compete in a free society,” said Garrett Marquis, a spokesman for the National Security Council. “The administration looks forward to working with M.L.B. to identify ways for Cuban players to have the individual freedom to benefit from their talents, and not as property of the Cuban state.”
In a statement, M.L.B. said: “We stand by the goal of the agreement, which is to end the human trafficking of baseball players from Cuba.”
One M.L.B. official, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, said the league had requested a face-to-face meeting with U.S. government agencies but were not granted one. M.L.B. was prepared to base its argument on the fact that the Obama administration had given it a license in 2016 to do business with the Cuban baseball federation, and that a Trump-era national security presidential memorandum published on June 16, 2017 promised the agreement would be grandfathered in. The memorandum stated that any new regulations “will not affect existing contracts and licenses.”
Several U.S. business entities, including travel and telecommunications companies, do business in Cuba. But M.L.B. officials worried that, as a high-profile organization, its deal would be challenged by hard-liners in the government.
John Bolton, the national security adviser, seemed to foreshadow the move on Sunday when he tweeted: “Cuba wants to use baseball players as economic pawns — selling their rights to Major League Baseball. America’s national pastime should not enable the Cuban regime’s support for Maduro in Venezuela.”
Cuba has produced some of the best players currently in the major leagues, including Aroldis Chapman of the Yankees, Yoenis Cespedes of the Mets and Jose Abreu of the Chicago White Sox. They and most other Cuban players in M.L.B. left their country illegally, in some cases smuggled out by disreputable agents and human traffickers on speedboats and rafts over dangerous waters.
“It’s bad in the sense that they can’t come anymore in the formal, legal way that was planned,” Chapman said on Monday.
For some players, the dangers continued after they arrived because they were at the mercy of the smugglers.
“To this date, I am still harassed,” Abreu, who has played for the Chicago White Sox since 2014, said in a statement issued at the time the deal was announced in December.
M.L.B. and its players union sought to eliminate that dangerous process by creating a posting system similar to the one used with players from Japan and South Korea. Under the plan, a major league team seeking to sign a Cuban player would pay a posting fee to the Cuban federation, which would in turn allow the player to leave the country and return home at will. Just days ago, the Cuban federation released the names of 34 players it said were eligible to sign with M.L.B.
“The objective of the agreement, which is the product of years of negotiations with the F.C.B., is to end the dangerous trafficking of Cuban baseball players who desire to play professional baseball in the United States,” M.L.B.’s lawyers said in their petition to the Treasury Department in January.
M.L.B. and the Cuban baseball federation commenced talks after the United States and Cuba began a thaw in relations under the Obama administration in 2014. Soon after that, baseball’s commissioner’s office secured a license from the Treasury Department to legally begin negotiations with the Cubans.
After announcing its agreement in December, M.L.B. quietly sought to convince administration officials — who immediately criticized the plan publicly — that it fit within the guidelines for an exemption to the trade laws. At the same time, M.L.B. officials were also resigned to the political opposition to the deal and the possibility of returning to the old method of signing Cuban players.

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Monday scrapped a historic agreement between Major League Baseball and the Cuban Baseball Federation that would have allowed Cuban players to sign with U.S. teams without needing to defect.
The existing deal will not be allowed to go forward because it was based on an erroneous ruling by the former Obama administration that the Cuban Baseball Federation was not part of Cuba's Communist government, a senior U.S. official said.
The move essentially overturns an agreement reached between MLB and the Cuban federation in December after three years of negotiation under which Cuban players would have had a safe, legal path to playing professionally in the United States. In the past, some Cuban stars have undertaken risky escapes, including being smuggled off the island in speedboats.
The U.S. decision was the latest step by President Donald Trump to roll back the rapprochement with Havana, America's old Cold War foe, that was spearheaded by his predecessor, Barack Obama. Trump has especially stepped up pressure on Cuba recently over its support for Venezuela's socialist president, Nicolas Maduro.
""The agreement with #MLB seeks to stop the trafficking of human beings, encourage cooperation and raise the level of baseball,"" the Cuban Baseball Federation said on Twitter. ""Any contrary idea is false news. Attacks with political motivation against the agreement achieved harm the athletes, their families and the fans.""
The senior Trump administration official suggested that the agreement would have subjected the players to ""human trafficking"" by the Cuban government, making them ""pawns of the Cuba dictatorship.""
Carlos Tabares, a member of Cuba's 2004 Olympic gold medal-winning squad who until last year played for a Havana team, said the Trump administration was seeking ""to destroy us, even through baseball."" The MLB deal, he said, would have allowed Cuban players ""to enter legally rather than falling into the hands of traffickers and having to risk their lives.""
The U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the administration would be willing to work with MLB to seek an arrangement consistent with U.S. law.
""We are unsure of the next steps,"" an MLB source said.
The announcement came just days after the Cuban federation released its first list of 34 players authorized to sign contracts directly with major league teams.
'A PAYMENT TO THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT'
The U.S. Treasury Department on Monday reversed the Obama-era ruling that Cuba's league was not part of the Cuban government, which had laid the groundwork for the baseball deal.
The Trump administration considers the Cuban Baseball Federation to be part of the island's National Sports Institute, which, according to the U.S. official, is a government entity that U.S. law says makes such business dealings illegal.
""A payment to the Cuban Baseball Federation is a payment to the Cuban government,"" Treasury said in a letter to MLB.
Cuba maintains, however, that its baseball federation is not part of the state. It says the federation falls under the Cuban Olympic Committee, which in turn reports to the International Olympic Committee, not the Cuban government.
MLB teams would have paid the federation a release fee for each Cuban player signed, providing a windfall for Cuban baseball, which has suffered from dwindling budgets and the defection of its best players.
In the past, many Cuban players seeking riches in the big leagues have made dangerous journeys via human traffickers to defect. Others abandoned the Cuban national team while playing abroad.
Cuban MLB players who had defected include Yasiel Puig of the Cincinnati Reds, Yoenis Cespedes of the New York Mets and Jose Dariel Abreu of the Chicago White Sox - all of whom have signed multi-year, multimillion-dollar contracts.
Puig defected from Cuba on a speedboat at age 21 and soon found himself entangled with Mexico's notorious Zetas crime organization, which threatened to chop off his arm if it failed to receive the promised $250,000 fee for his passage.
When Puig finally reached U.S. shores in 2012, he was rewarded with a seven-year, $42 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers.
Under the deal agreed by MLB and the Cuban federation in December, MLB teams were going to pay the federation a fee ranging from 15 percent to 25 percent of the value of player contracts.
That money, which was not to be deducted from the player’s salary but be paid on top of it, would have been used to help Cuba further develop its baseball program.
Cuban players older than age 25 and with six years of service in the Cuban league would have been free to sign with MLB teams. Younger players would have needed Cuban baseball’s permission to leave.

BURNLEY, England — When Mike Phelan was asked if he would like to return to Manchester United and assist Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in turning the club around after the sacking of Jose Mourinho in December, he barely paused for thought before agreeing.
Having enjoyed plenty of success at Old Trafford as Alex Ferguson's trusted right-hand man, the chance to return after a six year absence was not an opportunity the 56-year-old was going to let pass.
But while that was an instant decision, there had been plenty of contemplation during his time away from the club.
""I had a time of reflection. I felt that I needed to look back and examine the processes that were in place. Because you just don't get the time when you are actually 'in it',"" he told Reuters at his East Lancashire home.
Phelan wanted to look back to find out exactly how United had enjoyed such dominance and conversations with Ferguson and former United CEO David Gill formed part of that process.
But after a brief spell as manager of Hull City in the 2016-17 season, with the club poorly resourced and heading for relegation, Phelan took time away from the game and decided to extend that investigation of leadership skills.
""I thought I needed to find out more. I am quite an open-minded sort of fella and the more people you meet, the more areas of expertise you venture into, you find yourself searching for that common denominator,"" he said.
Phelan talked to people in rugby and other sports and looked at American coaching and management methods as well as the world of business.
""What I found was that the simplicity in most things tends to be the most effective. We are all looking for the secret ingredient but when you start to talk to people at the elite level, the top end, you find they do the simple things better than most people,"" added the former United player.
COLLABORATION
As Phelan describes the conclusions he reached, it is also evident they have been put into practise at United since December.
""The (leaders) communicate better and they actually hand over the reigns to people to get on with their jobs. You bring people into your environment, you communicate well, you express your thought process and then you hand it over and see what comes back,"" he said.
A look at the technical area during games reveals that approach in action. Solskjaer is in charge but Phelan frequently is out on the touch-line guiding players and the other coaches, Michael Carrick and Kieran McKenna, are also part of the collaboration.
""I like the idea of sharing, seeing people grow, (then) the end product,"" he says.
Still, Phelan has been surprised how quickly Solskjaer was able to change the mood at the club, bringing back a sense of enjoyment.
""It was an instant response,"" he says, noting the way that Solskjaer created a ""breath of fresh air"" around the club's Carrington training complex.
SCOPE FOR IMPROVEMENT
The challenge, now that the Norwegian has been appointed the long-term manager, is to turn that 'bounce' into a more substantial improvement. Phelan believes they are helped by having players who still have plenty of scope for improvement, none more so than Paul Pogba.
Pogba looked unhappy and unsettled during the latter period of Mourinho's time at the club but has shone since the change.
""I think that happened to quite a few players, they probably drew into themselves a little bit and were very cautious,"" says Phelan.
""Paul had a spell where all the eyes were on him and delivery of his best wasn't there all the time, the consistency.
""Now we are trying to apply ourselves to Paul's game. Ole has done a terrific job at helping Paul through certain spells and he has embraced that. He is maturing all the time.
""He is not the finished deal even though everyone looks at him and sees a World Cup winner already but he is not the finished deal, there is still a lot more to come and that is the exciting bit about United.
""There are players there who haven't achieved for the club what they need to achieve and we want to make sure that they relish that experience, embrace the opportunity to win things at Manchester United.""
Another of those players is left back Luke Shaw, who has significantly improved in recent months.
""We think that there is more to come from Luke – he is young, he is energetic and he has an attitude which is developing all the time. We feel that the world is his oyster... he is a huge player,"" says Phelan.
GLORY DAYS
With United facing Barcelona in a Champions League quarter-final first leg on Wednesday, there is the sense of the club being on the right path to rediscovering their glory days.
Phelan certainly doesn't feel the past is a weight on the club nor has that success reduced his own personal hunger.
""I want these players to enjoy their own great moments for themselves but I also want to do it again – that is the drive,"" he said.
""It is different this time around, of course it is. It was six years ago, but it is not impossible, definitely not impossible.""

NEW YORK — Dwyane Wade was hurting, sitting on the training table trying to get enough treatment to get him on the floor one last time.
A couple of hours later, he looked like a guy capable of playing well beyond the final night of his career.
Wade had 25 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists in his last NBA game, which the Brooklyn Nets won by beating the Miami Heat 113-94 on Wednesday night to finish 42-40 and clinch the No. 6 seed in the Eastern Conference.
With close friends LeBron James, Chris Paul and Carmelo Anthony leading the cheers from their courtside seats, Wade had his fifth career triple-double in three quarters. He fittingly secured it with a pass to Udonis Haslem, his teammate of 15 years who plays sparingly now and made his only start of the season.
""I was like, I don't know why, but everybody feels like now you've got to go out and score 60 in your last game because Kobe did it,"" said Wade, wearing a sparkling gold jacket and gold sneakers. ""So hopefully I took the bar all the way back down and say let's go get a triple-double, that's easier.""
A night after scoring 30 points in his final game in Miami, Wade showed one more time that he's walking away with his skills intact.
He played 36 minutes, dribbling out the shot clock the final time he had the ball before checking out with 10 seconds remaining. Then it was time for a lengthy postgame celebration on the court with teammates and friends.
""The man went out with a triple-double. Don't let that go unnoticed. He had a triple-double,"" All-Star D'Angelo Russell said. ""He is a guy that paved the way for a lot of us. He's been with that franchise for that long period of time. He's Mr. Miami.""
Russell had 21 points on seven 3-pointers for the Nets, who will face the third-seeded Philadelphia 76ers beginning this weekend in their first postseason appearance since 2015, one that seemed unlikely when they were 8-18 in December. But they went 34-22 from there for their first winning record since going 44-38 in 2013-14 — when they were knocked out by Wade's Heat in the second round.
""Special night,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""Pretty amazing season so far.""
The game mattered only to the Nets, who quickly ended any fears of finishing seventh and having to face the Toronto Raptors in the first round.
But that was secondary to a last chance to celebrate Wade, the three-time NBA champion who was ending his 16th and final NBA season.
He was loudly cheered from the moment he emerged alone from the tunnel for pregame layups. Fans — egged on at one point by Paul and Anthony — chanted ""We want Wade! We want Wade!"" when he was on the bench, even though the 37-year-old guard had played a season-high 35 minutes Tuesday and coach Erik Spoelstra warned before the game that it probably wouldn't be that way again.
But there was no keeping Wade down for long. It took him a little bit to get going, as Jarrett Allen added Wade to the list of stars whose shots he's blocked this season — a list that included James.
""I loved seeing CP and Melo over there getting the crowd going to get Dwyane back in there and Dwyane comes from the old-school NBA,"" Spoelstra said. ""That was pre-load management, so we were not load managing him tonight and I was not talking to my sports scientist whether he could go, even though I walked in and saw him on that training table an hour before the game and he did not look fit to go, at all. But he's cut from a different cloth.""
The Heat hoped the final game would matter, but the Nets and Orlando Magic had clinched spots over the weekend to leave only one spot left coming into the last week. Miami was eliminated from contention for it despite its victory Tuesday.
""For me, I'm happy with this season,"" Wade said. ""Unfortunately for our organization and our team, we weren't able to put ourselves in a position to win enough games to be in the playoffs, but for what I wanted for this season, I'm happy to say that I completed that.""
TIP-INS
Heat: Haslem finished with 12 points and 11 rebounds. ... Wade passed Elgin Baylor (23,149 points) to move into 29th place on the NBA's career list. He finished with 23,165.
Nets: Starters Joe Harris (toe) and DeMarre Carroll (right wrist) sat out, though Atkinson said they would be ready for the playoff opener. ... Shabazz Napier scored 20 points off the bench.
THE LAST JERSEY
Wade has been exchanging jerseys with players after games this season, but there was one missing. Anthony, who helped persuade Wade to return this season, didn't play long this season before parting ways with Houston. So Wade gave his final one to him.
""I didn't get an opportunity to play against Melo this year and exchange jerseys with him,"" Wade said. ""That was a missing piece out of this whole season, so everything worked out great for him being here, for me having an opportunity to give him my jersey.""

Excuse Derick Brassard for having a little difficulty finding his bearings after the veteran center took an unorthodox cross-country route in reaching the NHL playoffs.
Starting the season with Pittsburgh, Brassard was traded to Florida and spent 10 games with the Panthers before landing in Colorado in time to help the Avalanche's late-season surge to clinch the Western Conference's eighth and final playoff berth. Brassard is also re-adjusting to center after playing on the wing in Florida.
""It's been kind of a weird season for me personally. By coming here, I had to try to adjust quickly,"" Brassard said Monday as Colorado prepares for a first-round matchup against Calgary. ""I feel like I'm fitting in really well. I wish I could chip in a little more. I think it's been three or four games, since I'm back to my normal position.""
Brassard, who has four goals in 20 games for Colorado, was one of 32 players involved in 20 deals struck at the NHL trade deadline on Feb. 25.
Brassard's acquisition — Colorado gave up a third-round draft pick — wasn't the most notable of the day. And yet it was a reflection of numerous teams' approach to addressing needs before making a final playoff push and beyond.
The Winnipeg Jets led the way in completing six trades, including acquiring veteran center Kevin Hayes from the New York Rangers. Central Division rival Nashville responded by acquiring forwards Mikael Granlund from Minnesota and Wayne Simmonds from Philadelphia. Vegas struck what was the most impressive deal by landing forward Mark Stone in a multiplayer trade with Ottawa.
The trades don't include various deals struck in the days leading up to the deadline, such as Columbus' addition of Matt Duchene and Ryan Dzingel in separate swaps with Ottawa.
And while other teams were wheeling and dealing, teams such as Presidents' Trophy-winning Tampa Bay elected to stand pat. The Lightning roster was already deep and talented at all positions.
""Well, I think if I was as the GM in Tampa, I'd probably stand pat, too,"" former NHL executive turned broadcaster Brian Burke said. ""They're the class of the league this year.""
In the end, Burke wondered how many of the trades will truly make the difference in determining the Stanley Cup champion.
""The trade deadline, so many mistakes are made,"" Burke said. ""(You have) 15 teams making moves at the deadline, and there's (only) one parade.""
Of the 16 playoff teams, only two — Pittsburgh and Colorado — were sitting outside the top eight spots in the conference standings on Feb. 25. Montreal dropped out in the East and Minnesota in the West.
The Jets' additions failed to push them ahead of the Predators in the race for the Central title, though they were enough to keep Winnipeg ahead of the late-charging S. Louis Blues. Winnipeg was a point behind Nashville on Feb. 25 and finished the season in the same position.
Jets general manager Kevin Cheveldayoff, however, believes his team is better prepared in opening the playoffs against St. Louis.
""They've meshed in,"" Cheveldayoff said of the newcomers.
""They've gone through the newness process,"" he added. ""That's over. They're just like every one of us now.""
In Nashville, the Predators believe they added leadership to the locker room and more of a hard-hitting presence on the ice in preparing to open against Dallas.
""Just seeing who we match up against in the playoffs, it's those heavier teams, bigger bodies and having guys up front who can handle the bigger D,"" defenseman Ryan Ellis said. ""The moves we made made our team better.""
In Columbus, the Blue Jackets went all in by adding to their roster rather than subtracting players such as goalie Sergei Bobrovsky and forward Artemi Panarin — both eligible to become unrestricted free agents this summer. Panarin led the team with 87 points, while Bobrovsky closed the season by going 10-3, including four shutouts.
Add in the likes of Duchene, Dzingel and defenseman Adam McQuaid, and the Blue Jackets believe they have the depth for a daunting first-round matchup against Tampa Bay.
""They've been through the trenches with us. They've been able to feel a part of this team, take ownership of this team and know their role within it,"" Blue Jackets captain Nick Foligno said. ""You look at it, and we're four deep everywhere. Our defensive core is set. It just makes you feel more confident.""
In Washington, the defending Stanley Cup champions benefited by adding forward Carl Hagelin and defenseman Nick Jensen.
Hagelin, a trusted two-way forward, had three goals and 11 points in 20 games with the Capitals after combining for just eight points in 38 games split between Pittsburgh and Los Angeles. Jensen's addition is even more important with defenseman Michal Kempny sidelined with a lower body injury.
""I think they kind of filled holes that maybe we had really well,"" defenseman Brooks Orpik said. ""Even if Kemper didn't get injured, I think adding another good NHL guy was important for us.""

MINNEAPOLIS — The longest active streak of missing the NBA playoffs belongs to Sacramento, where general manager Vlade Divac has been trying to return the Kings to the league's elite over the last four seasons.
Back when the slick-passing Serbian big man was in the paint, the Kings had quite the run. For his impact on the NBA as one of the pioneering Eastern Europeans, Divac was announced Saturday as one of the 12 honorees in the 2019 class of the Basketball Hall of Fame.
""We created something special there, the first day of training camp that led us,"" said Divac, who played for Sacramento from 1998-2004, with a peak in 2002 when the Kings lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in overtime of Game 7 of the Western Conference finals. ""For six years, we were the most exciting team in the league and really played basketball the right way.""
The class will be enshrined at the Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts, on Sept. 6. Selected this year with Divac were NBA players Carl Braun, Chuck Cooper, Bobby Jones, Sidney Moncrief, Jack Sikma and Paul Westphal, NBA coach Bill Fitch, NBA contributor Al Attles, WNBA player Teresa Weatherspoon, the 1957-59 teams from Tennessee A&I and the Wayland Baptist University program.
Divac, who was elected directly by the international committee, played 16 years in the NBA, including eight with the Lakers. The 7-foot-1 Divac had his jersey retired by the Kings after helping them start a streak of eight straight postseason appearances upon his arrival. They never advanced past the conference finals, a surge that coincided with the Lakers dynasty of Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal.
One of Divac's fellow starters on those Kings teams was Chris Webber, who wasn't included in the class. Now an analyst for CBS Sports, Webber quickly sent Divac a congratulatory message after the announcement in Minneapolis at the Final Four.
""For the last five or six days when I found out I was going to be there, I was only hoping that he was going to be next me,"" Divac said. ""I'm sure it's going to happen down the road, but it would be awesome if he was right next to me.""
Moncrief and Sikma, who were elected by the North American committee, were teammates with the Milwaukee Bucks from 1986-89. The seven-time All-Star Sikma, who won an NBA title in his second season with the Seattle SuperSonics, set a record with the Bucks in 1988 as the only center in history to lead the league in free-throw percentage at 92.2. Sikma is now a consultant with the Toronto Raptors, who are in second place in the Eastern Conference behind the resurgent Bucks.
""My hope is we get in the conference finals and we're facing the Bucks, and then I'll kind of keep my thoughts to myself a little bit,"" Sikma said, smiling.
Moncrief was a five-time All-Star and two-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year in the mid-1980s for the Bucks, who lost in the Eastern Conference finals three times during his career. Moncrief also reached the Final Four in his final season at Arkansas, 1978-79, under coach Eddie Sutton, for whom he gave credit for instilling in him the fundamentals that carried him to professional success.
""You'd take a four-hour practice: three hours on defense. Seriously,"" Moncrief said. ""And they wonder why I couldn't shoot when I got to the NBA! I didn't shoot. I just played defense.""
Weatherspoon, who was elected by the women's committee, was a five-time WNBA All-Star for the New York Liberty who was the first in the league to reach 1,000 points and 1,000 assists. She led Louisiana Tech to an NCAA championship in 1988.
Jones and Westphal were the other players elected by the North American committee. Jones was an eight-time NBA All-Defensive first team pick and four-time All-Star with the Philadelphia 76ers, winning a title with them in 1983. Westphal was a five-time All-Star who won a championship with the Boston Celtics in 1974.
Fitch coached in the NBA for 255 seasons, leading the Celtics to a title in 1981 and still holding the franchise's best winning percentage at .738. The other election by the North American committee was the Tennessee A&I teams that won NAIA championships in 1957, 1958 and 1959. The program now known as Tennessee State was the first to win three straight titles in any college division.
Attles was a direct election by the contributor committee. He played for the Philadelphia Warriors from 1960-71 and later was a coach, executive and ambassador for the organization. Cooper, who died in 1984, was directly elected by the early African American pioneers committee. He was an All-American at Duquesne in 1950 and the first African American player drafted by an NBA team. Braun, directly elected by the veterans committee, died in 2010. He was a five-time NBA All-Star who won a title with the Boston Celtics in 1962.
Wayland Baptist, elected directly by the women's veterans committee, was among the first women's programs to award scholarships. Under the guidance of coach Harley Redin, the small school in West Texas won 131 straight games from 1953-58 and 10 national championships overall.

HONG KONG — Chinese game-streaming company Huya Inc, backed by Tencent Holdings Ltd, has launched a follow-on share offering of about $343 million to raise funds for investment in its content and e-sports partners.
Huya, which went public last year in New York, is part of a growing trend of Chinese tech companies returning to capital markets for cash soon after their initial public offering (IPO).
Huya is selling 13.6 million primary shares, the game-streaming firm company said in a stock exchange filing. At the same time, social media platform YY Inc is selling 4.8 million of Huya shares, the filing showed.
Based on its closing price of $25.23 on Monday, the combined sale could raise as much as $464 million.
There is an over-allotment - or greenshoe option - of up to 15 percent for Huya's share sale, meaning the firm could raise as much as $394 million if exercised. There is likewise a 15 percent over-allotment for YY's stake sale.
Huya is China's biggest live-streaming game platform, according to the offering prospectus, competing with Douyu which plans to go public in New York this year.
China boasts the world's largest gamer base in e-sports with about 266 million gamers in 2018, the prospectus showed.
Huya's shares have risen about 65 percent since the firm's IPO in May, in which it raised $180 million.
Other companies from the 2018 IPO cohort returning for more funds include electric vehicle maker NIO Inc, video streaming company iQIYI Inc, e-commerce firm Pinduoduo Inc and video platform Bilibili Inc.
Bankers are pinning their hopes for 2019 on additional capital raising through follow-on offerings or convertible bonds as the crop of Chinese companies looking to go public thins out after a blockbuster 2018 in terms of IPOs.
Many of the companies that went public in 2018 raised less money than they had hoped for - partly due to global market jitters and partly because investors pushed back against lofty valuations - which will drive follow-on capital raising.
Huya will price its follow-on offering after New York markets close on Tuesday.
Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs and Jefferies are joint bookrunners for the deal.

The not-quite-ready-for-prime-time Thanksgiving exhibition with Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson produced such bad golf that Mickelson and country singer Jake Owen traded barbs about it a day later at Jordan Spieth's wedding.
Owen said it was so bad he deserved a refund. He told Barstool Sports' ""Fore Play"" podcast that Mickelson, who won $9 million from the TV spectacle, pulled out a wad of $100 bills, handed one to Owen and told him he had 90,000 more where that came from.
Golf's two biggest attractions are back at the Masters, eager to play the kind of golf this week that they couldn't produce in The Match. The two 40-somethings will be on prominent display, though the trash talk that was promised on the pay-per-view money grab will not be heard on the hallowed grounds of Augusta National.
And, unlike The Match, the Masters will deliver.
It always has, with moments like Woods stunning the field in a runaway victory at the age of 21, or Mickelson leaping for joy on the 18th green after finally winning his first major in 2004.
It always has, even when an unknown like Danny Willett came from nowhere to win, only to quickly disappear from the golf landscape.
And it even did last year when Patrick Reed won a green jacket that few in the Sunday crowd seemed particularly happy about.
The Masters enjoys special status as the enduring annual rite of spring, the place every duffer who has ever picked up a club dreams of hitting shots. Set under magnificently manicured fairways and greens and framed by towering pines, it offers a tantalizing glimpse of summer in a place where nothing seems to change but something is different every year.
Arnold Palmer won there four times and Jack Nicklaus six. Woods has four green jackets, and Mickelson has three.
Still, the defending champion is rarely the focus and for the most part the big names in the game aren't either. The course is the star, even when the real tournament begins — as is Masters lore — on the back nine on Sunday.
That's true more than ever this year, even as spectators and television viewers got a rare sneak preview of Augusta National on Saturday for the first time with the final round of a women's amateur tournament.
Reed comes in mired in a deep slump that had him seeking the aid of swing coach David Leadbetter last month, at the insistence of his wife. Bookies in Las Vegas make him a 40-1 pick, long odds for someone trying to become the fourth player to repeat as Masters champion.
Still, Reed said last month he was looking forward to everything about the Masters, except the fact he will have to turn in his green jacket if he's not successful in repeating.
""You want to keep it around as long as you can,"" Reed said of the famous jacket. ""The only way you're going to do that is continue winning at Augusta and continue winning the event so you can have it year in and year out.""
History suggests that won't be happening, since only three players before Reed have returned to successfully defend their title. But there is golf to be played before that's decided, and a champion's dinner to be eaten.
Reed said at The Player's Championship that he figured out the menu for the dinner long before he won.
""Oh, I knew that back when I was 13,"" he said. ""I mean, it was always a bone-in ribeye, mac and cheese, creamed corn, creamed spinach. I'm going to fatten those boys up a little bit.""
Reed didn't exactly bask in the love of the galleries last year when he rolled in a 3-footer on the 18th green to beat Rickie Fowler by a shot and Spieth by two. The stories that followed didn't make him any easier to root for, when he declined to discuss why his parents weren't welcomed at the tournament despite living just a few miles away.
Mickelson and Woods, meanwhile, have had their own personal issues, though that hasn't dented their popularity. The two are icons of modern golf, and even in their 40s they are among the group of favorites that include Fowler, Spieth, Rory McIlroy and Dustin Johnson.
Just don't expect Mickelson to do what he did at the U.S. Open last year and run after a putt and hit it while it's still moving. Do that at Augusta National and you'd get a one-way trip back out Magnolia Lane, and no invitation in the mail the next spring.
Don't expect Mickelson or Woods to play as badly as they did in their pay-per-view match, either. Both know every inch of grass on Augusta National, both know how to hit miracle shots when it really matters and both have lots of experience in putting the green jacket on.
Then again, Woods hasn't won a Masters in 14 years, and Mickelson is almost a decade removed from his last green jacket. They're legends on a legendary golf course, but there are probably 20 younger players who can beat them when playing their best.
Mickelson and Woods sold their Thanksgiving match with a promise of riveting golf and even better TV.
No need to sell this. It's the Masters, and it's as real as golf gets.

Wes Johnson, the first pitching coach to jump from college to the majors, is part of a tech-savvy generation that eschews the eyeball test.
By
Tyler Kepner
When Wes Johnson started his coaching career, in 2003 at
Abundant Life high school
in Sherwood, Ark., he quickly learned what he needed to win. Invariably, his teams would end their seasons by losing close playoff games to dominant pitchers. Johnson began a quest to find out how to build an ace.
His skill at doing so led to several college jobs, most recently as the pitching coach for the University of Arkansas, his platform for an unusual leap this season, to the Minnesota Twins. Johnson is believed to be the first pitching coach to jump from college to the major leagues.
In Johnson’s first game, on March 28, starter Jose Berrios and the bullpen gave him just the kind of victory that once eluded him: a 2-0 gem over the Cleveland Indians. The Twins totaled 39 strikeouts (13 in each game) in their three-game opening series, an encouraging sign for a staff that has struggled for years to master the art of power pitching.
The Indians have no such trouble; four of their starters topped 200 strikeouts last season, helping the team win its third consecutive American League Central title. For the Twins to challenge, they need Johnson’s pitchers to respond to his modernized approach, which relies heavily on biomechanics.
“I’m going to come in and tell them the why,” Johnson said, repeating what he told the Twins’ top baseball officials, Derek Falvey and Thad Levine, in his job interview. “The biggest thing is: ‘Why are we doing something?’ And it’s not going to be a subjective why. It’s going to be 100 percent objective through science or through their data. If we’re going to make a change to a guy, we can’t just make a change because it doesn’t please our eyes.”
Johnson, 47, personifies a trend in baseball: pairing tech-savvy coaches with a generation of players who crave actionable data. The coach’s pitching background is largely irrelevant; like Johnson, the new pitching coaches for the Los Angeles Angels (Doug White), the Seattle Mariners (Paul Davis) and the Cincinnati Reds (Derek Johnson, formerly of the Milwaukee Brewers) never pitched in an affiliated professional league.
“Those are the four that maybe never did anything, never played pro ball, that are going to be cutting edge,” said Brent Strom, 70, the pitching coach for the Houston Astros. “I’m just glad I’m getting out now while they’re coming up. I might just slyly get out of here and let them take over. These guys, they know their stuff.”
Before his college coaching career — which wound through Central Arkansas, Dallas Baptist, Mississippi State and Arkansas — Johnson connected with Strom through Pat Harrison, a mutual friend. Strom invited Johnson to a clinic featuring Paul Nyman, a pioneer in sports science who emphasized momentum over balance in a pitcher’s delivery, with research, rather than conventional wisdom, to support his theories.
At smaller colleges, especially, Johnson tended not to have the most polished prospects, who had signed professionally or chosen larger programs. To compete, he specialized in development, imparting the lessons he learned from Nyman, Strom and others like Ron Wolforth, the founder of the Texas Baseball Ranch, who hosted clinics they all attended.
Wolforth cited Johnson’s personality and curiosity as reasons for his unlikely rise.
“He’s so bubbly, and he just bounces off the walls with energy,” Wolforth said. “For those first 10 years or so, from high school to Central Arkansas to Dallas Baptist, he started to experiment with some things and find out what worked, and as he did that, he would add the next brick. Some things were just accepted dogma, but Wes was really interested in a different perspective. He looked at things upside down.”
Falvey, a former Indians executive who joined the Twins as chief baseball officer in October 2016, met Johnson at a Wolforth clinic and followed him from afar. When the Twins fired Paul Molitor as manager after last season and restructured the coaching staff, Falvey, a former pitcher at Trinity College, turned to Johnson, intrigued by his many years of studying the craft.
“There’s an argument to be made that in college circles, in the last few years, anyway, they may have been using more information and technology than we were on the pro side,” Falvey said, adding later: “In the professional game, the traditional way of getting on the field was: You finish playing and you become a coach. There was no real in-between step of learning and developing.”
Strom did pitch professionally, for five major league seasons in the 1970s, but his Astros pitchers respond to him because of his information and ability to convey it. The Astros’ staff led the majors in strikeouts last season, and Strom said the Twins could be similarly transformed.
“They’re going to be much, much better because of Wes,” he said. “For years, the Twins had always had the reputation of inducing contact, so they wouldn’t strike out many people. It reminded me of when I was with the Cardinals: induce ground balls, sinkers, that kind of stuff. Wes is bringing four-seam fastballs, elevated pitches, sequencing pitches, and he knows the delivery very well because he’s studied it.
“It just goes to show you that players don’t really care who you are; they care if you care, and Wes really cares. He cares for the players.”
The Twins have needed a change. In the eight full seasons since their last division title, in 2010, they had the fewest strikeouts per nine innings in the majors, just 6.79. They were pitching to contact with poor results, allowing a .305 average on balls in play in those seasons (worse than every staff except Colorado’s), and inducing soft contact just 17.6 percent of the time, matching Arizona for the worst such figure, according to FanGraphs.
Last season, though, the Twins set a franchise record for strikeouts — 1,377, almost precisely the league average. But they also issued 573 walks, their most in 22 years. Johnson said the Twins would use data to devise more effective pitch sequences, tailored to each pitcher’s stuff and physiology.
“I’ve been asked that question: ‘What’s your pitching philosophy?’” Johnson said. “Well, I’ve got one for Mike Pineda. I’ve got a completely different one for Martin Perez or Kyle Gibson or Jake Odorizzi. Because their bodies work different, their stuff plays different, they need different things in the training room. Some guys need more momentum; some guys don’t need as much momentum. Some guys throw across their body because they’ve got loose hips, so you may not change that guy. But another guy who throws across his body, because he’s got tight hips, you’ve got to change him.”
That last idea brought a smile to Jim Kaat, the ace of the Twins’ 1965 A.L. championship team. Kaat, now a television analyst for the Twins and MLB Network, thrived under the pitching coach Johnny Sain, a progressive instructor for his time who understood spin better than his contemporaries and encouraged hip rotation through rudimentary drills.
“We did those things in the old-fashioned methods, but now they can actually show you where you could improve by 5 percent, 10 percent,” Kaat said. “All that stuff, Johnny would be interested in it for sure.”
The methods of measurement have changed. But for the wisest pitchers and coaches, the desire to evolve never ends.
Ron Darling, Mets broadcaster and former pitcher, issued a statement on the morning of the team’s home opener Thursday saying that he stands by the stories in his new book but would have no further comments because of a legal threat.
The book
, “108 Stitches: Loose Threads, Ripping Yarns, and the Darndest Characters From My Time in the Game,” was released Tuesday by St. Martin’s Press and accuses Lenny Dykstra of shouting racist taunts at Boston Red Sox pitcher Oil Can Boyd before Game 3 of the 1986 World Series. Dykstra — who then homered off Boyd to start the Mets’ comeback in that series — has vehemently denied the story, and some 1986 teammates have supported him publicly.
Without wading into that controversy, it should be noted that Dykstra is mentioned on just four of the 245 pages in a spirited, revealing read. Darling is an exceptional broadcaster because of the refreshing honesty underlining his communication skills, and those qualities come through in the book, written with Daniel Paisner. Darling gives his unvarnished opinions of players, managers, coaches and broadcasters, spiced with colorful, revealing anecdotes that only a perceptive former teammate would know.
Frank Howard, his first manager, did not travel with a suitcase; a clubhouse attendant would wash his only set of clothes at the ballpark every day while Howard was in uniform. Kevin Mitchell, a teammate in 1986, chased down a mugger on a Boston street after Darling won Game 4 of the World Series. Alejandro Pena, a Mets reliever in the early 1990s, had Darling’s favorite clubhouse nickname: Dirty, Stinky, Rotten, Filthy Al Pena.
“I never knew why,” Darling writes. “He wasn’t dirty, stinky, rotten or filthy. But that’s what we called him, in full. And, best of all, he answered to it.”
The Dykstra accusation is serious, of course, and Darling is also critical of others for lesser offenses. But with a thorough reading, the book is just as memorable for the whimsical, breezy tidbits that add texture to some of well-known characters he has known in a long, honorable career in baseball.
Elvis Luciano had never pitched above the rookie league when the Toronto Blue Jays chose him
eighth over all
in December in the Rule 5 draft. To keep him in their organization — without offering him back to his previous team, the Kansas City Royals — the Blue Jays would have to put Luciano on their major league roster. They did, and he made his debut on March 31 with one and a third scoreless innings.
That was noteworthy, if unremarkable; some Rule 5 draft choices always end up on the rosters of rebuilding teams. What makes Luciano distinctive is his birth date: Feb. 15, 2000. He became the first player born in the 2000s to appear in a major league game.
Judging by recent history, Luciano has a high standard to meet. Based on a list provided by the Elias Sports Bureau, the last three first-of-their-decade major leaguers have had long, successful major league careers.
The first major leaguer born in the 1970s, pitcher Wilson Alvarez, lasted 14 seasons, throwing a no-hitter and making an All-Star team. The first from the 1980s, the Los Angeles Angels slugger Albert Pujols,
is the only player with 600 home runs
, 3,000 hits and two World Series championships. The first from the 1990s, Miami Marlins shortstop Starlin Castro, has made four All-Star teams and once led his league in hits.
Then again, others made a much smaller impact. The first player from the 1910s, Joe Cicero, played briefly for the Boston Red Sox in 1929 and 1930, and then roamed the minors until resurfacing with the 1945 Philadelphia Athletics. Tim Conroy, the first player from the 1960s, pitched twice for the Oakland Athletics in 1978 — just days after he was drafted from a Pennsylvania high school — and went 18-32 over all for the A’s and the St. Louis Cardinals.
Fortunately for Luciano, he has already done more in his career than the first major leaguer born in the 1900s: John Cavanaugh, a Philadelphia Phillies third baseman who was born on June 5, 1900. Cavanaugh made his debut on July 7, 1919, striking out against Jesse Barnes of the New York Giants in his only at-bat. He never appeared in the majors again.
Tyler Kepner has been national baseball writer since 2010. He joined The Times in 2000 and covered the Mets for two seasons, then covered the Yankees from 2002 to 2009.

Racing has long been a big part of Colton Herta’s family life, so it was not much of a surprise when he took after his IndyCar-driving father and began racing go-karts as a boy.
What was a surprise, to him and everyone else: winning an IndyCar Series race six days before his 19th birthday. Herta, who still lives at home in Southern California with his parents, recently became the youngest winner in the history of the sport’s top level.
Herta led the last 15 laps to win a race on March 24 at Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Tex. It was only his third IndyCar Series race, but the victory was no fluke: He qualified to start fourth in the 24-car field, and he held off the pack after Will Power’s car broke down.
Herta’s father, Bryan, 48, won four races and drove in the Indianapolis 500 five times. He was at the track to call strategy for the scion of another racing family — Marco Andretti, grandson of Mario — and was stunned at how quickly his own son had won a race.
“You’d be foolish to put that kind of expectation on anybody,” Bryan Herta said.
Colton Herta, meanwhile, is tied to a family that made its name in a different sport. One of his car’s owners is George M. Steinbrenner IV, the 22-year-old grandson of George M. Steinbrenner, the principal owner of the Yankees from 1973 until his death in 2010.
When Herta took the checkered flag at Austin, Steinbrenner became the youngest owner to win a race in the IndyCar Series. Steinbrenner did not just team up with Herta: The two race buffs have known each other for at least 10 years, Herta said.
“We sort of had the same desire to make it in IndyCar,” said Steinbrenner, whose father, Hank, is a Yankees part-owner and co-chairman. “We thought we could do it together.”
As ecstatic as the team was to win in Austin, Herta said, “It’s kind of a freak situation with how young the team is.”
And it was just the second IndyCar Series race for the team, Harding Steinbrenner Racing.
But Steinbrenner’s partner, Mike Harding, an Indianapolis asphalt and concrete contractor, wasn’t that surprised.
“I think he’s going to be a superstar” owner, Harding said.
Steinbrenner was an intern in 2016 for Bryan Herta’s race team, which won the Indianapolis 500 with Alex Rossi, an American driver.
Steinbrenner learned enough from Herta to realize that he wanted his own race team. With help from Michael Andretti, Marco’s father, Steinbrenner decided to field a car in the Indy Lights second-tier series in 2017. And after two years of racing in Europe, Colton Herta wanted to come back to the United States.
“George probably wouldn’t have hired me if he didn’t think I could win,” Herta said. “He gave me my start. I have a lot of loyalty to him. He’s been good to me.”
Steinbrenner acknowledged that his last name “draws a lot of attention and expectations.” He added: “My family’s history in sports is one of success. That’s a precedent my grandfather set. It’s one that can’t be ignored. It’s what he would expect.”
But he also said, “It would be best for us, still being new to the series, to not shift our focus or expectations too much.”
In the 2017 and 2018 seasons, Herta and Steinbrenner teamed to win six of 33 Indy Lights races, with 20 top-three finishes. Herta won his second Indy Lights race, in St. Petersburg, Fla., and Bryan Herta remembered tearing up after his son’s victory.
Colton Herta drove in one IndyCar Series race last season, finishing 20th among 25 cars. Steinbrenner and Harding became partners last September, with a plan to enter the IndyCar Series full time in 2019.
Herta started 11th but finished eighth in the season opener on March 10 in a road race in St. Petersburg. Herta, Harding and Steinbrenner thought they could do well in the race on the road course at Austin, after they had an encouraging test session there in February. Herta had also driven on the team that won its class in January at the Rolex 24 at Daytona.
Bryan Herta said of his son: “He doesn’t get too up or too down. He’s been very emotionally level his whole life. He’s really good at hitting reset.”
The next IndyCar Series race is Sunday at Barber Motorsports Park in Birmingham, Ala., another road course, and Herta would seem to have a good chance to win again.
The rookie driver and rookie team still need to qualify in May for the sport’s ultimate race, the Indianapolis 500. And the competition in the series remains formidable. The car owned by Bryan Herta and driven by Marco Andretti finished sixth at Austin, 19 seconds off the pace set by Colton Herta.
After Colton’s big win, Bryan Herta said his son was more excited than he had ever seen him as a driver.
Days later, Colton had calmed down. “We realize we’re still coming together as a team,” he said. “We want to make sure it wasn’t a freak incident that happened with winning a race.”

ST. LOUIS — Matt Wieters made the most of his chance.
Wieters drove in a three runs and stole a base for just the third time in six years, leading the St. Louis Cardinals over the Los Angeles Dodgers 11-7 Thursday for a four-game sweep of the NL champions.
Making his first start this season, the 32-year-old Wieters hit a sacrifice fly in the second inning and a two-run double in the fifth that put the Cardinals ahead 8-7. With runners at the corners in the fifth, Wieters stole second as Matt Carpenter struck out, his first steal since April 27, 2017, and just the ninth of his major league career.
""Normally, I try to get one a year,"" Wieters said with a smile.
Wieters went to spring training with a minor league contract and earned a job as a backup to nine-time All-Star Yadier Molina. Wieters had just one previous plate appearance this season; he was hit by a pitch on April 1.
St. Louis' bullpen combined for 5 1/3 scoreless innings in the series finale and allowed one run in the four games.
""This whole series was a well-played series on our side,"" Wieters said."" Today we had to do it a little differently coming from behind. The bullpen's been amazing of just nailing it down for us.""
Harrison Bader was hit by pitches with the bases loaded in both the second and fifth innings. He was the first player to force in runs twice in a game while getting hit since Toronto's Reed Johnson on April 16, 2005, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.
""Over the course of 162 games, every RBI matters,"" Bader said. ""Whether you walk or get a single, they all count. It came at a good time. If I've got to wear it for the club, I'd do it again.""
He was part of a rare two-run wild pitch in the second inning by Walker Buehler. When the ball bounced toward the first base dugout and first baseman David Freese let catcher Rocky Gale chase after it, Jeff Gyorko scored from third and Bader from second.
""Out of the hand, saw the ball in the dirt,"" Bader said. ""Obviously, I've got to watch the runner in front of me, but I knew it was kind of kicked away far enough. As I was rounding third base, I was just picking up the first baseman to see what he was doing. He really wasn't going after it too hard, so I just took a chance and took an extra base.""
José Martinez matched a career high with four hits, including an RBI double off Yimi García in a two-run sixth. St. Louis set a season high for runs and swept the Dodgers in a four-game series for the first time since July 15-18, 2010.
""We just didn't pitch well today,"" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. ""Didn't play well. I thought we swung the bats well, put ourselves in a position to win a baseball game, but didn't play well defensively. This is the first game that I felt on the pitching side across the board, the defensive side, we just didn't play well.""
Freese and Buehler hit solo home runs in the second inning for Los Angeles, and Kiké Hernández homered to cap a four-run third.
Giovanny Gallegos (1-0) pitched 1 1/3 scoreless innings in his first appearance of the season for the Cardinals to win in relief of Michael Wacha, who allowed seven runs and eight hits in 3 2/3 innings. It was the first Major League win for Gallegos in 23 appearances.
Pedro Báez (0-1) gave up four runs — three earned — and four hits in one inning.
Trailing 7-4, St. Louis started to close when Gyorko singled in a run in the third. The Cardinals' four-run fifth included a run-scoring error by second baseman Max Muncy.
KERSHAW
Los Angeles Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw is scheduled to make his season debut on Monday at home against the Cincinnati Reds.
The 31-year-old left-hander, troubled by left shoulder inflammation since early in spring training, made his second minor league injury rehabilitation start on Tuesday. He gave up two solo home runs and five hits over six innings for Double-A Tulsa against Springfield. He struck out six, walked none and threw 59 of 81 pitches for strikes.
In his first rehab start last week, Kershaw gave up two runs and four hits in 4 1/3 innings for Triple-A Oklahoma City against San Antonio.
MAKING MOVES
Dodgers: Los Angeles recalled RHP Jaime Schultz from Oklahoma City and optioned RHP J.T. Chargois to the Triple-A farm team.
Cardinals: Utility player Yairo Muñoz will rejoin St. Louis as a 26th player for this weekend's series against the Cincinnati Reds in Mexico.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Dodgers: SS Corey Seager was hit by a pitch by Gallegos in the fourth, left at the start of the bottom half and was diagnosed with a bruised left hamstring.
""We flushed it out with treatment after that hit by pitch, and it feels better,"" Seager said. ""We get on the flight home, obviously, with altitude you've got to see how it responds to that, so tomorrow we'll know more.""
UP NEXT
Cardinals: RHP Adam Wainwright (1-0, 4.50) is to start Friday against the Reds and RHP Tanner Roark (0-0, 5.79). Wainwright is one win shy of 150.
Dodgers: LHP Julio Urías (0-0, 3.12) is scheduled to start at home Friday against Milwaukee and RHP Corbin Burnes (0-1, 9.90).

AUGUSTA, Ga. — The 10th anniversary of the Thanksgiving night car crash that changed the course of golf history is months away. But as a smiling Tiger Woods exited the Augusta National Golf Club clubhouse on Tuesday to cheers and applause, it was not too soon to consider his renaissance since the fall from grace that began when his then wife chased her philandering husband from their home and he drove his S.U.V. into a neighbor’s tree.
It also might be an occasion to observe how cultural status can be recouped with demonstrated, untiring perseverance. Woods kept showing up. There is power, too, in being a wildly popular sports figure transformed into an underdog who struck rock bottom: Two years ago, he was charged with driving under the influence as he sat asleep in a painkiller haze at the wheel of his car with the motor running. He later pleaded guilty to reckless driving.
Whatever the lens to view Woods’s current fate, it helps to revisit a scene in 2010 at Woods’s first competitive appearance after five months of blaring tabloid headlines about extramarital affairs that forever besmirched his legacy. The scene was similar to Tuesday’s, with Woods emerging from the Augusta National clubhouse for the 30-yard walk to the first tee, where he began a practice round on the eve of the Masters tournament.
But in 2010, a stone-faced Woods was met not with shouts and clapping but with an eerie stillness. Only a few hundred spectators had gathered for his 8 a.m. tee time, and they noiselessly parted without comment to permit him access to the golf course.
No four-time Masters champion had ever been treated with such indifference at Augusta National, nor will one likely be again. The pretournament conjecture was that Woods would be a target of heckling and snide comments. Instead, he received the silent treatment.
Perhaps Woods believed the famous serenity of Augusta National’s pristine grounds could bring some tranquillity to his then rancorous life, but he appeared only nervous and uneasy.
His opening tee shot rocketed into the woods left of the first fairway, and he marched off in haste after the uncommonly ugly outcome.
Woods had reason for feeling especially anxious. A glut of security officers flanked him on every step, including armed sheriffs, unarmed guards and plainclothes police officers. The whirling of television news helicopters circling overhead provided a constant noisy soundtrack to his presence.
Worse, a day earlier, Billy Payne, then the Augusta National chairman, had delivered a harsh rebuke, saying Woods did not live up to role model expectations and had “disappointed all of us, and more important, our kids and our grandkids.”
All in all, not a great day for the world’s top-ranked golfer, who had won 14 major golf championships and was still expected to vault past the record, Jack Nicklaus’s 18.
But the Augusta National scene on Tuesday found Woods humbled and changed in ways unimaginable from the 2010 Masters. Yes, he is still chasing a 15th major championship, but tellingly, he seems less frantic about that pursuit than ever. Asked if he would have expected such a lengthy major drought, Woods calmly answered, “Yeah, I would say that I wouldn’t have foreseen that, for sure.”
He thought he would win more, he said, adding, “But unfortunately, I just didn’t do it.”
Repeatedly, he acknowledged a new — or is it rediscovered? — embrace of the sport’s fans. He talked about the surging gallery that enveloped him on the concluding hole of last year’s Tour Championship, when he won his first PGA Tour event in five years, a triumph that seemed to eclipse the travail of four back operations and myriad off-course embarrassments.
“I had chills,” he said of that gallery on 18 seven months ago.
It was his 80th tour title, and yet Woods said of that victory, “I didn’t know if I could ever get there again, and lo and behold, I got there again.”
Meaningfully, Woods also freely revealed his vulnerability, something that 10 years ago happened about as often as he six-putted a green.
Queried about the reliability of his putting, Woods insisted he was still a strong putter, but one with a problem.
“The hardest part is I just can’t practice like I used to,” he said. “My back gets sore. I just can’t log in the time that I used to, and that goes with every part of my game.”
The invincible Tiger Woods was not only admitting to a weakness, he was smiling about it.
“It was a little bit easier when I could work on everything,” he said with a grin. “But that’s no longer the case. You know, I just can’t do all the things all the time anymore.”
Woods, now ranked 12th in the world, maintains a belief in his chances this week. He knows the golf course better than any other top golfer in the field. He is convinced of the mental fortitude provided by the momentum he gained last season when he held a final-round lead at the British Open, contended late in the P.G.A. Championship and won the final event of the tour calendar. This season, in five events, he has had four top-20 finishes.
Moreover, Woods, credibly and palpably, is no longer haunted by the most inglorious chapter of his past. He’s O.K. with looking backward. He knows he made a lot of mistakes.
This week, he announced that at the 2019 Masters he would once again wear the collarless mock neck pullover he made famous in his prime. He will don a version of it in all four rounds, he said. That’s what he wore
in 2005
, the last time he won the Masters.
“I thought it was a pretty neat look back in the day,” he said on Tuesday with a laugh.
All these years later, there was little left to hide.
“I was probably in a little better shape back in those days,” he said. “But I won events wearing the mock. I’ve always enjoyed wearing them, and you’ll see it on Thursday.”

PADUCAH, Ky. — Authorities say a Michigan youth basketball coach accused of punching a Kentucky referee, knocking him unconscious, has been charged with assault.
News outlets cite a statement from the McCracken County sheriff's office in Kentucky that says 40-year-old Keyon Menifield of Flint, Michigan, had a disagreement Saturday with the referee, 61-year-old Kenny Culp of Paducah. The statement says Culp turned to walk away when Menifield struck him.
Culp was taken to a hospital for treatment, and deputies charged Menifield with assault of a sports official. It wasn't immediately clear whether he has an attorney.
Culp's niece, KaSondra Barnett, said on Sunday that he was being treated for a broken collarbone, a crack in his sinus cavity, and a concussion.
McCracken County Sheriff Matt Carter says the investigation is ongoing.

The high-profile partnership was announced on Thursday.

After Kanye and Adidas, and Rihanna and Puma; after Questlove and Nike, and Kendrick Lamar and Reebok, it was only a matter of time. And on Thursday, the first lady of Everything, Beyoncé Knowles, entered the sneaker wars.
Adidas announced that it would collaborate with Ms. Knowles on several endeavors, including a signature collection with Adidas and an expansion of the singer’s active-wear brand, Ivy Park. She will be a creative partner at Adidas.
In a statement, Ms. Knowles called the coming collaboration the “partnership of a lifetime” and touted a shared philosophy “that puts creativity, growth and social responsibility at the forefront of business.”
The pop star and entrepreneur will retain ownership of Ivy Park, which was introduced in 2016 in partnership with Topshop and sells comfort wear and athleisure at retailers including Nordstrom. In 2018, Ms. Knowles acquired full ownership of the company after Sir Philip Green, Topshop’s owner,
was accused of racial abuse and sexual harassment
.
Little financial information about Ivy Park is available, and it is unclear how successful the brand has been. It was
immediately popular
upon its release in 2016. On Thursday, its website had been altered to broadcast the Adidas partnership.
The Beyoncé/Adidas collaboration is perhaps the most notable partnership between a superstar and a sports brand yet, and it indicates the consumer and social power that can be derived from such cross-branding. It is also a tribute to the lane Rihanna paved in 2014 when she became
a creative director and global ambassador at Puma
, back when it was still a novel idea that an entertainer might lend her name to a company best known for athletic apparel. (Rihanna parted ways with Puma and is now said to be
working with LVMH
on her own luxury brand.)
Championing women and girls has become a key part of Adidas’s public relations strategy. This month, the company announced a new phase of its “She Breaks Barriers” initiative, which highlights the lack of equal media coverage for women’s sports in the United States.
Ms. Knowles
has positioned herself as a political voice for black Americans
and for women, including through her musical examination of her marriage and her 2018 Coachella performance, which gave a platform to historically black colleges. She will amplify these messages, and those Adidas has already pushed, by giving the company her imprimatur.
“Beyoncé is an iconic creator but also a proven business leader, and together, we have the ability to inspire change and empower the next generation of creators,” said Eric Liedtke, a member of the executive board of Adidas AG.
Adidas’s “multilayered” partnership with Ms. Knowles will include a program whose resources will be given over to “the next generation of athletes, creators and leaders.”
Last July, Forbes estimated that Ms. Knowles was
worth $355 million
, citing her most recent solo album, “Lemonade,” her million-dollar-grossing tour with her husband Jay-Z and the value of her stake in his streaming service, Tidal.

AUGUSTA, Ga. — The first time that Sergio García’s older brother, Victor, caddied for him at the Masters, García handed him his putter on the ninth hole of the Wednesday par-3 contest and watched him drain a 25-foot birdie attempt. More than a decade later, Victor is again inside the ropes at Augusta National with his brother, but this time he will be shepherding García through the 72-hole tournament, which began Thursday.
For almost 20 years, García’s caddie was Glen Murray, who provided the temperamental García with a ballast of stability and steadiness. Never mind yardages and club selection; no course has ever tested García more than his own passionate, perfectionist and occasionally tortured self.
So when García, 39, decided last spring to part ways with Murray, citing a need for independence as he ended one of the more enduring caddie-player collaborations, his challenge was to find someone whose strength was reading him more than reading greens.
The split with Murray occurred a month after García missed the cut in his Masters title defense. He said he had made the move because he felt as if he had come to rely too much on Murray’s counsel.
“I had a good friend caddying for me for 17 years, but now I feel like this is what I need,” García said, adding: “I’m taking ownership of my decisions. It helps me kind of deal with my mistakes better.”
After the split, García considered some intriguing candidates, including one he already spends a lot of time with: his wife, Angela.
She was a fine amateur player who finished her collegiate career at Texas. She knows what it takes to perform in the caldron of competition, and her resting state is cheerful, both ideal qualities for a caddie.
“I think we would make a great team, I have no doubt, because the few times we get to play golf we have a lot of fun,” Angela García said recently.
Over the years, a few wives have caddied in PGA Tour events for their husbands, most notably Justine Reed and Nicki Stricker. The former world No. 1 Lee Westwood won his first European Tour title in four years last fall with his girlfriend, Helen Storey, on his bag. She is now his full-time caddie.
“We talked about it briefly,” García said, “but, no, I don’t want her to go through that.”
Shortly before last year’s Masters, the couple welcomed their first child, daughter Azalea. “Ultimately, we kind of decided I’m a mom first and foremost,” Angela García said.
It was probably for the best, she added. After all, there are stressful moments in golf tournaments, no matter how good the Garcías are at calmly working through their differences. “If he did something silly and I tried to help him, I wouldn’t know how that would go,” she said.
As García was mulling his options, his wife suggested Mardy Fish, the retired tennis player who advanced as high as No. 7 in the men’s singles world rankings and won six career ATP titles.
García’s friendship with Fish, an Olympic silver medalist, dates back more than a decade. Fish is an avid fan of golf, while García is a tennis fan, and over the years they bonded over their love for each other’s sports.
They’ve seen each other through adversity. Fish was there for García after he broke up with the tennis star Martina Hingis, and García was with Fish at the 2012 United States Open when he withdrew just minutes before a fourth-round match against Roger Federer because of a racing heart. Fish was later diagnosed with an anxiety disorder.
A former professional athlete caddying for a major winner is not without precedent; the ex-N.H.L. forward Dan Quinn has had several caddying stints with his good friend Ernie Els.
García’s wife phoned Fish to gauge his interest in caddying. Fish was intrigued by the idea. He was far enough removed from his professional playing days that he felt he could happily recede into the background and do the unglamorous work to help García shine. He had been working with the United States Tennis Association player development team in Los Angeles, where he learned very quickly, he said, “that it’s not about you anymore.” He was comfortable with that.
Speaking recently by telephone, Fish added, “Angela and Sergio knew I understood what he was going through mentally, and I know where to put the bag and how to rake the bunker.”
But the idea blew over before Fish had a chance to talk to García. Fish wasn’t keen on the prospect of spending long stretches on the road, away from his wife, Stacey, and their two young children, though he said he would love to carry García’s bag one year at the Genesis Open in Los Angeles.
In January, Fish accepted the captaincy of the United States Davis Cup team. And García decided to enlist the services of his brother, who played college golf at Francis Marion University, a few hours’ drive from Augusta National.
During the practice rounds, García’s brother gazed at the dogwoods and the towering pines, surveyed the azaleas in all their splendor and basked in the tranquillity of the tucked-away 13th tee.
“He’s excited about caddying here,” García said Wednesday. “But it is not the holidays.”
With his brother at his side, García enjoyed a scintillating stretch between the end of September and the end of January, posting seven consecutive top-10 finishes, including one second, one third and a victory in the Andalusia Valderrama Masters in their native Spain.
Then came the Saudi International the first week of February, where García was disqualified for “serious misconduct” after damaging a few greens during his third round. García later apologized for his behavior, which he said had sprung from a personal situation that he was not handling well.
On the day that García was disqualified, Fish spoke with García’s wife. “We talked for a while just about how to handle it,” Fish said. “I think she trusted what I had to say because I’ve lived it.”
Fish said he had told García’s wife to let the other members of his team address his behavior. When García called, he said, her only question should be, “What time can I pick you up at the airport?”
“Sergio’s had the best support of his life,” Fish added, “and that’s why he’s played so well.”

TORONTO — The Maple Leafs superstars John Tavares and Auston Matthews have been as good as advertised this season, and often even better.
But Mitch Marner, who came to this championship-starved city with high expectations after he was chosen with the No. 4 overall pick in 2015, has had a breakout year and made a case that he’s the most valuable Maple Leafs forward.
Marner, a 21-year-old winger, led Toronto in points this season and became the youngest player in Maple Leafs history to record 90 points, the first to hit that benchmark in 22 years.
Marner finished 11th in the N.H.L. with 94 points (26 goals and 68 assists), six points ahead of Tavares and 21 ahead of Matthews, who missed 14 games because of injury. Marner and Tavares play on the same line, and Marner was a key reason Tavares, in his first season in Toronto, had a career-high 47 goals this season.
[
N.H.L. playoffs: first-round schedule and results
]
Tavares, Matthews and Marner, along with goaltender Frederik Andersen, will need to be at their best as the Maple Leafs seek postseason redemption against the Boston Bruins, their first-round opponent for the second straight season. Their best-of-seven series starts Thursday in Boston.
The wounds remain fresh from last spring’s opening round, when Toronto coughed up a 4-3 second-period lead and lost, 7-4, in a shocking conclusion to Game 7.
But last season the Leafs didn’t have Tavares, the longtime Islanders star. His signing to a seven-year, $77 million contract as a free agent last summer created hope in a city long accustomed to hockey failure. The Leafs haven’t won the Stanley Cup since 1967 and haven’t won a playoff series since 2004.
Although Marner can’t match Tavares or Matthews in goal-scoring ability, he has wowed everyone with his vision.
“The one thing about Marner,” Tampa Bay Lightning Coach Jon Cooper said, “is he is as smart a player as this league has not only seen this year, but has ever seen.”
Marner attributes his creativity to playing multiple sports as a youth. Soccer helped develop his footwork, and lacrosse was important in developing his hands and mobility around the goal area.
“Both soccer and lacrosse are creative in their own ways,” Marner said. “In soccer, I was a midfielder so I did a lot of the running up and down the field, and lacrosse-wise I think it helped with the hands a lot. It’s a different kind of motion in lacrosse for trying to get around guys, so I think that helped as well.”
Born in Markham, Ontario, north of Toronto, Marner evokes comparisons to Patrick Kane and Johnny Gaudreau, other elusive, flashy stickhandlers. But in these parts, the 6-foot, 175 pound Marner is more reminiscent of Doug Gilmour, another smallish Maple Leafs forward who brought a heart and joy to the game.
“He’s skilled, explosive and wants the puck and sees the ice so well,” said Gilmour, who believes Marner will someday break his franchise record for assists in a season, 95.
Tavares said Marner has talked to him on the bench about the patterns he saw opponents employing.
“He just reads the game so well, not just with the puck, but without it, that he’s able anticipate plays,” Tavares, 28, said.
Whether it’s because of his peach-fuzz cheeks or lack of size, Marner was often overlooked as he developed. But one person has championed those skills from the start: his father, Paul.
When Mitch was 4, his father phoned the hockey skills coach Rob Desveaux to see if he could give the boy private lessons as he had with Tyler Seguin, now with the Dallas Stars.
Desveaux, who runs 3 Zones Hockey School northeast of Toronto, turned Marner down, saying he started training players at age 6.
Paul Marner called a week later, and Desveaux stood firm. A couple of weeks later, Paul called again.
“Oh, my God, this guy,” Desveaux remembered thinking to himself.
When Mitch and his father arrived, Desveaux was in for another shock.
“Oh, my God, he’s tiny,” Desveaux said.
“Yeah, but watch him,” Paul pleaded.
Mitch flew around the ice once, and the skills coach turned to Paul and said: “O.K., he’s in.”
Desveaux has been Marner’s on-ice skills coach ever since.
Marner exudes a boyish charm and sense of warmth that has made him a fan favorite across the league. He has been seen singing along to Bon Jovi on the bench.
On Feb. 14, during the pregame warm-up in Las Vegas, a young girl in a Leafs jersey held up a sign at ice level. “Hey Mitch. Be My Valentine,” the sign read.
Marner skated over to shrieks of delight from the young girl, and he posed for pictures.
In early March, Marner celebrated the seventh birthday of Hayden Foulon, who has been battling leukemia, by giving tickets to her and her family.
Marner, who met Hayden in 2015 when he was a forward with the O.H.L.’s London Knights, also gave her a necklace with a heart-shaped locket with room for a photo of both of them.
“She is my hero,” Marner said. “She means a lot to me and my family.”
Marner’s rise to hockey’s highest level has not been without bumps, despite early signs of great potential.
In 2013, Marner entered the O.H.L. draft listed at 5-7 and only 130 pounds. He slid all the way to No. 19, amid concerns about his size and durability, a theme throughout his hockey career.
And in the 2015 N.H.L. draft, the Leafs considered taking defenseman Noah Hanifin with their No. 4 overall pick until they settled on Marner. He was sent back to juniors in the 2015-16 season and didn’t crack the Maple Leafs roster until 2016-17. Then, early in his second season, Babcock demoted Marner to the fourth line for a time because the coach was unhappy with Marner’s defensive play.
Marner used the experience to get stronger in the off-season with his longtime off-ice performance coach Dan Noble.
To boost power in his legs so he could bounce off opponents with acceleration, Noble fitted Marner with a water vest. During squats, the water moves around, creating an imbalance that mimics hockey players’ dynamic movements.
“We call it bulletproofing his hips,” Noble said.
Marner is eligible to become a restricted free agent this summer, and many, including former Maple Leafs General Manager Brian Burke, believe he can command the kind of money Tavares and Matthews make at around $11 million a season, although such a rich deal would add to the club’s salary-cap challenges.
“He’s their most exciting player,” said Burke, now a television analyst. “I love Auston Matthews, but he ain’t selling tickets. He ain’t exciting. Mitch Marner is exciting.”

Rory McIlroy went for the bold play, even if it turned out a little off line.
Asked how he had dealt with four unfulfilled attempts to complete golf’s career Grand Slam, McIlroy offered a historical reference as perspective.
“I guess I’ve become a lot more comfortable with the fact that I’m going to fail more times than I succeed at that certain conquest,” he said, pointing out that Abraham Lincoln even lost some elections. “He wound up being the president of the United States,” McIlroy said. “So I’ve still got a bit of time.”
McIlroy knows the select fraternity he would join if he added a Masters to the titles he already won at the United States Open, British Open and P.G.A. Championship. The full set of majors has been captured by only five men, including Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods.
Also this year, Jordan Spieth can achieve a career Grand Slam at next month’s P.G.A. Championship and Phil Mickelson can at the United States Open in June. But it’s McIlroy who is up first at Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia.
“I know exactly the people I would be putting myself alongside,” he said. “It would be huge. But again, I can’t think about it that way.”
He has lately been on a roll. Even for someone who seems to have plenty of time (McIlroy is 29), the momentum he brings into this year’s first major doesn’t come around often.
Last month’s one-stroke victory at the Players Championship capped a run of six starts to open 2019 in which he finished no lower than sixth. He also reached the round of 16 at the WGC Match Play in March, eliminated on the 17th hole of a tense battle with Woods.
“Right now it’s all Rory McIlroy,” said Paul Azinger, NBC’s lead golf analyst. “He’s in contention every week. We’ve criticized him whenever he didn’t win, then he goes ahead and wins the biggest event on the PGA Tour.”
“You just get the feeling that it’s going to be a big Rory year.”
Though McIlroy is No. 3 in the world rankings, behind Dustin Johnson and Justin Rose, no one has accumulated more ranking points since the calendar turned.
“When his mind’s right and he’s putting good,” said Jason Day, who will also play at the Masters, , “I think he’s explosive.”
McIlroy has shown an ability to pile up wins in bunches. He collected 14 of them worldwide from 2012 through 2015, including three of his four major championships. He was second on 12 other occasions during that span.
That said, McIlroy’s current success has been marked by a different demeanor and he is calm as he considers the big picture. Tournament results can vary, but performance is the yardstick.
“You’re not going to get frustrated playing good golf,” he said.
Even with a green jacket — and a permanent entry in golf history — at stake?
“There’s a difference between a personal desire and a need,” McIlroy said. “I would have said a couple of years ago, ‘I need to win a Masters. I need a green jacket’. Now it’s, ‘I want to win it. I’d love to win it. But if I don’t, I’m O.K.’ And I think that is the difference.”
Success by McIlroy, Spieth or Mickelson would elevate them to a stratosphere occupied only by Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Nicklaus and Woods.
“When I first came out, I just wanted to win any major,” Mickelson said at last year’s U.S. Open. “Any major would have been great. Now that I’ve won the other three majors, it’s U.S. Open specific. I would love to win this one to win all four. That’s certainly a goal and nothing I’m shying away from.”
McIlroy said it would be great if all three golfers achieved the Grand Slam.
“How good would it be this year if Jordan won the P.G.A. and Phil won the U.S. Open and I won Augusta?” McIlroy said. “Golf would be right in the center of all sports stories if that were to happen.”
Not only is McIlroy leading off the quest, he’s also widely considered by analysts to have the best chance of breaking through.
“If I was a betting man, I would bet that he gets it,” said Jim Mackay, now an NBC analyst after two decades as Mickelson’s caddie.
A couple of years ago, such expectations might have affected McIlroy. This is his fifth trip to Augusta in which the Masters has beckoned as the lone missing piece from his major collection.
Each of his previous four Masters had left McIlroy exactly six strokes behind the winner. His final position has ranged from fourth to a share of 10th, but the six-shot gap has been unyielding.
His closest call came last year, only to wind up the most disappointing. Trailing Patrick Reed by three and playing alongside him in the final pairing, McIlroy cut into the deficit on the first hole and faced a short eagle putt at No. 2 that could have drawn him even.
McIlroy missed, tumbled to a closing 74 and wound up with a share of fifth.
“That’s when you really have to preach patience,” McIlroy said. “You know the golf is in there; it’s just letting that golf come out when it matters most. I need to almost take my foot off the gas and just let it happen. And that’s obviously easier said than done.”
Then again, he needs only to look at the past few months to see how the process can pay dividends.
Though he was unable to clinch first against Xander Schauffele’s charge at Kapalua in January, against Johnson in Mexico in February or in his own lack of birdie chances in March on the final day at Bay Hill in Florida, McIlroy latched onto positives.
Then when victory finally arrived at the Players, his reaction, a weak fist pump, was subdued.
“It’s been having a focus over the last six of seven months on my attitude, especially my attitude to golf,” said McIlroy, who married shortly after the 2017 Masters. “Not letting golf define who I am as a person, trying to keep the two things very separate.”
It’s a mind-set some players don’t attain until long after they’re 29. For now, it seems to have freed McIlroy to play the most consistent golf of his career. It may yield a green jacket, but if it doesn’t, he’s prepared to deal with it.
“At the end of the day, all you’re trying to do is get that ball in the hole,” he said. “If you feel like you’re doing that pretty well, then what’s there to be frustrated about?”

AUGUSTA, Ga. — As Patrick Reed surveyed his second shot, he seemed to have a dozen worries on his mind.
Which way was the wind blowing? Where on the green should he land his ball? Would the fans in his peripheral vision stop moving?
In a sport where the ball is still and the mind is active, and where distractions from unruly fans, bad bounces or sudden gusts of wind abound, focus can be difficult to maintain. But during the first round of the 2018 Tour Championship in Atlanta, it became nearly impossible. Reed took one last look at his target and what he saw nearly made his head go haywire.
Why was his estranged father standing behind the green?
No one on the PGA Tour these days has his powers of concentration tested as much as Reed, whose sometimes brash personality generates intense reaction among his peers and the public alike. For every person like the two-time major winner Curtis Strange, who said that he admires Reed’s self-belief, there are dozens who will never forgive him for proclaiming himself “a top-five player in the world” when he was 23 years old and ranked No. 20.
Yet easily the worst distraction that Reed faces any week, but especially this one, when he will defend the Masters title he won last year, is the possibility that at any moment he will look up and come face-to-face with the most painful chapter of his life.
Reed’s parents live six miles from Augusta National Golf Club, in a two-story, Southern-style Colonial replete with a bedroom shrine to their first child and only son, who hasn’t stepped foot in the house since 2012. This week should be a joyous homecoming for Reed, who led Augusta State (now Augusta University) to back-to-back national championships and will preside over Tuesday’s legends-laden Champions dinner. But instead it has all the makings of a nightmare, with his acrimonious relationship with his family threatening to become as much a part of this year’s Masters narrative as his attempt to become the first golfer since Tiger Woods in 2002 to successfully defend his title.
“I wouldn’t at all be surprised if they show up,” Reed said.
Reed, 28, has steadfastly declined to speak publicly about the reasons for the family schism. In a Sports Illustrated story in 2015, Reed’s mother insinuated that the rift resulted from Reed’s marriage, at age 22, to the former Justine Karain, against the advice of his parents who worried that he was too young.
Reed’s parents were not invited to last year’s Masters, when their son held off a challenge from Rickie Fowler and Jordan Spieth down the stretch, just as they were not invited to his 2012 wedding. They have not met either of his two young children. To attend this week’s tournament, they will have to enter the grounds with badges they did not obtain from him.
Last year the drama was confined to the course, but in the year since, Reed said he knew of two occasions in which his father and younger sister, Hannah, followed him at golf tournaments. Their motivation remains a mystery. When contacted for this article, Reed’s parents politely declined to comment. In an email, Reed’s mother replied, “At this time we have no comment on this subject and we hope you will respect the privacy of Hannah, Bill and myself.”
Danny Coulson, a former deputy assistant director of the F.B.I. who directs the PGA Tour’s security, saw Reed’s father at the first of the two events where Reed also noticed him, last September’s Tour Championship at Atlanta’s East Lake Golf Club. Coulson said he had cordially explained to Bill Reed what he and his staff have expressed over the years to Patrick: If Reed’s father wishes to watch golf, he is free to do so unless he does or says anything that would warrant his ejection.
Reed had other guests at the Tour Championship. He is extremely close to the Karains. One of Justine’s brothers, Kessler Karain, is his caddie and another of her brothers, Dan Karain, was visiting from Texas to lend his support. Justine stayed home in Houston that week, but from his spot in the gallery, Dan Karain was the first to recognize Reed’s father and sister behind East Lake’s fifth green as Reed was preparing to hit.
Reed said afterward that he wasn’t aware that his father and sister were there until the par-4 17th hole, when he was sizing up his approach shot and he noticed them standing along the rope line behind the green. He said he immediately tried to steer his focus back to golf.
Reed was wild off the tee that day, hitting only six fairways, but later said his problems were strictly self-inflicted. If he had noticed his father and sister on the front nine, he said, “I would have called for security to throw them out.” But those were his emotions boiling over after a round so frustrating that he went straight to the range after signing his scorecard and hit dozens of balls.
The week after the Tour Championship, Reed’s father and sister made the 4,300-mile trek to Paris for the Ryder Cup, where they followed Reed during his Sunday singles victory. Reed never saw them, he said, but members of his inner circle did, and they said they spent the afternoon tracking both Reed’s play and Bill and Hannah’s movements. As the Americans’ upset loss to the Europeans was winding down, only a few people close to Reed knew about the drama unfolding outside the gallery ropes.
Reed acknowledged later that he understands intellectually that if his father, mother or sister wants to watch him play, there is nothing he can do about it.
The Masters spectator’s guide has clear rules for patrons: No cheering a player’s misfortune and no inane or profane outbursts. Any violators are subject to immediate removal. But no rules exist to address a player’s estranged parents following their son.
At the 2014 United States Open in Pinehurst, N.C., Reed’s parents attended the second round using badges they had obtained from friends. Upon spotting them in Reed’s gallery, Reed’s agent expressed concerns to the U.S.G.A. security officers. On Monday, the U.S.G.A., in response to questions from The New York Times about the incident, said its security officials opted to escort Reed’s parents off the course and confiscate their badges after local law enforcement officers observed Bill Reed making what they described as “intimidating movements” toward Reed’s wife.
“Patrick and Justine Reed had no involvement in this decision,” the U.S.G.A. said.
Phillip B. Costa Jr., the manager and lawyer for Team Reed Enterprises, said that Reed had not reached out to Augusta National officials to request any special security this week.
Reed knows his on-course persona makes him a convenient villain. He is the cocky player who speaks his mind and walks the course leading with his chin, the former college delinquent whose underage drinking and other immature behavior, which hastened his departure from Georgia after one year, continues to trail him as a pro.
Rory McIlroy, who lost to Reed in a riveting singles match at the 2016 Ryder Cup and was paired with — and outplayed by — Reed in the final round of last year’s Masters, said: “The negative perception is all from hearsay, it’s all secondhand. I truly believe you can only base and judge someone’s character on how they’ve treated you. And Patrick’s always treated me well.”
McIlroy added, “He’s got a bit of an edge, and I think you need that to be successful out here.”
At a tournament in Germany last year, Reed called out a television crew member for jiggling coins as he was preparing to hit. At a playoff event outside Boston, Reed posed for a selfie at a Red Sox game and posted it to his Twitter feed criticizing his PGA Tour-issued seats — from which he had a crystal-clear view of his peer Justin Thomas, another major winner in his 20s, throwing out the first pitch.
And at the end of last year’s Ryder Cup, Reed even questioned the pairing decisions of Jim Furyk, the American captain.
“Does he ask for a little bit of it?” Dustin Johnson, who was a squad mate of Reed’s in Paris, said in reference to the fans’ vitriol. “Yeah,” said Johnson, who added that he likes Reed. “But I promise you, he doesn’t care what people say.”
Well, maybe a little. The Monday after last year’s Players Championship, Reed spoke with Ross Berlin, the tour’s senior vice president for player relations, on the putting green at the next stop on the schedule. Reed described the heckling he had endured at the tour’s flagship event, which included taunts like, “Everybody hates you, Reed!” Berlin listened intently and took notes.
When Reed was finished, Berlin promised that the tour’s security would do a better job rooting out the unruliest fans. He reminded Reed that he can have fans ejected, and offered as examples two players — McIlroy and Thomas — who have done so.
Reed thanked him but said he couldn’t have anyone ejected from the course. The problem with being golf’s perceived villain is ejecting the bad guy is bound to make things worse, not better. “It’s pretty much a no-win situation,” Reed said.
Can Reed contend this week, given all that he is contending with? What if he arrives on Sunday at the par-3 12th, with its hourglass green, to a swirling south wind lurking behind the trees and his estranged family behind the tee?
“What will I do?” Reed asked rhetorically. “What can I do? Nothing.”

What do you know about the world of horse racing? Have you been to a horse race or watched one on TV? If yes, do you have a favorite horse or race?
Did you know that horsing was once one of the most popular sports in America and nearly every newspaper had a horse racing page? In fact, three horses (Secretariat, Man o’ War and Citation) and two jockeys (Willie Shoemaker and Eddie Arcaro) were included in
ESPN’s 100 greatest athletes of the 20th century
.
While the sport’s
popularity has declined
in recent years, nearly $12 billion is bet annually at North American racetracks, and the
Dubai World Cup
has a winner’s purse of $12 million.
Late last month, a horse was euthanized after a terrible fall during a race at Santa Anita Park in California — the 23rd death there in just over three months, igniting a longstanding debate:
Is horse racing ethical?
In “
Death of Another Horse at Santa Anita Rocks the Racing Industry
,” Joe Drape writes:
Horse racing is among America’s oldest sports and perhaps the only one ever run out of the White House: Andrew Jackson operated a stable there during his presidency. Yet the multibillion-dollar industry is reeling as the Kentucky Derby approaches, with the death of yet another thoroughbred at the premier Santa Anita Park in California amplifying anxiety over whether the sport will continue in the state.
On Sunday, a gelding named Arms Runner fell during a race, sustaining a catastrophic injury to its right front leg that required the horse to be euthanized. It was the 23rd equine fatality since Dec. 26, and it came on only the third day of racing at the track since it had halted competition on March 5.
“I’m concerned about the publicity we’ve been getting,” said Bob Baffert, the Hall of Fame trainer
who won the Triple Crown
with American Pharoah in 2015 and with Justify last year. “This is our March Madness. But we’re having the wrong kind of madness. We feel like we’re all under the gun. We should be under the gun. You can’t defend a horse getting hurt.”
The track, in Arcadia, Calif., northeast of Los Angeles, had been closed to study why it had become so deadly, as well as to begin putting in place aggressive, wide-ranging drug and safety protocols. The spike was startling considering that in 2017, there were 20 deaths in a total of 8,463 starts over a span of 122 racing days at Santa Anita, according to Jockey Club data.
The racetrack, however, will remain open after the most recent fatality and on Saturday will host one of its signature races, the Santa Anita Derby, an important steppingstone for 3-year-old horses hoping to line up for the Kentucky Derby on May 4.
“We know what the stakes are and understand that we might be the place that kills horse racing in California,” said Tim Ritvo, chief operating officer of the Stronach Group, which owns the track. “Yes, we are worried, but we are confident that the track is safe and have gone the extra mile on rules that put us more in line with the rest of the world. We got to keep our doors open.”
The horse deaths have become a rallying point for the animal rights movement, which is particularly strong in California, where it would take 600,000 signatures on a petition to prompt a ballot initiative on whether horse racing should continue to exist. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has asked Gov. Gavin Newsom to form an independent panel to investigate how the track, breeders, owners, trainers, jockeys and veterinarians treat the horses.
“The veterinarians and trainers and track have not done all that they can to protect the horses,” said Kathy Guillermo, a PETA vice president.
The article concludes:
For decades, horse racing has experienced spikes in fatalities without adopting significant changes. The Horseracing Integrity Act of 2019 was introduced in Congress last month by Representatives Paul Tonko, Democrat of New York, and Andy Barr, Republican of Kentucky. The bill would create a private, independent authority responsible for developing and administering a nationwide antidoping and medication control program for horse racing.
“I think it has a better chance to pass today,” Janney said. “Every sport, every industry, has to change with the times. This is a scary time, but every undertaking is a result of getting a glimpse at the downside of staying where you are.”
Students, read the entire article, then tell us:
— Is horse racing ethical? Make the case for or against the morality of the sport.
— What is your relationship to horses? Have you ever ridden or cared for a horse? How does your experience affect your views on the sport of horse racing?
— In a related article, Lord Teddy Grimthorpe, the owner of Enable, who was named the European Horse of the Year for 2017,
said
:
All the good trainers will tell you that a horse has to have certain levels of athletic ability. There is no question of that, but I think the real X-factor is having the mind to actually want to do it and having that joy of wanting to gallop. Enable does. She wants to be out, and she wants to be running. That’s her natural way. She doesn’t like being left in the stable.
What is your reaction to Lord Grimthorpe’s statement? Do you think it can be said that a horse enjoys its role as a racehorse?
— What do you think could make the sport safer? If you believe horse racing is unethical or should be banned entirely, what do you think about the use of animals in other sports like
rodeos
or
bull fighting
?
— Are you a fan of horse racing? Have the recent deaths at Santa Anita Park changed your views? Will you watch the Kentucky Derby next month?

Alan Arbesfeld gets us over the midweek hump.

Deb Amlen
WEDNESDAY PUZZLE
— When we talk about “wheelhouses,” we are describing the length, breadth and depth of one’s knowledge. Something you know is in your wheelhouse. Something you don’t really know might be guessed at, but you couldn’t really say that it is in your wheelhouse. Things you absolutely don’t know are in your outhouse.
Ha ha! Just kidding, sort of. I can take a reasonable guess at some sports clues, but usually they are not only outside my wheelhouse
and
my outhouse, but they actually reside down the road in a neighboring town.
That’s how I wound up searching for the definition of today’s revealer. It is not a terribly hard term to figure out as sports terms go, unless you have a very vivid imagination that persuades you to search for images of the surgical separation of conjoined twins, which I definitely don’t recommend.
Anyway, you might have an easier time deciphering Alan Arbesfeld’s revealer, but first you are going to have to do some math.
1A: In crosswords, we typically think of a REBUS as a puzzle element that calls for more than one letter in a square, but it can also be a shape or an image that takes the place of a word. “A ewe for you, say” does not mean that you will be receiving a sheep in the mail. It means that the word “you” is being replaced by an image of a ewe in a puzzle.
41A: It took me awhile to get this one, because my brain got stuck on music as soon as it saw the word “oldies.” The answer to “Ones who never listen to oldies?” is AGEISTS, because the clue (not me, so please resheath your swords) is talking about younger people who do not listen to or are biased against older people.
44A: Hand up if you thought this clue, “Big name in oil,” was about the kind of crude oil that comes out of the ground. Not today. This clue is about cooking oil, and the answer is WESSON.
52A: I’m not a betting person, but I would be willing to wager that
FO’C’S’LE
, a nautical term that is short for “forecastle,” will be near the top of the list of entries that solvers had to reveal. That list is how we come up with our weekly “What the Heck Is That?” feature, and it would not surprise me if FO’C’S’LE was our next entry.
3D: SAT flashback time! I have watched a ton of “Top Gear,” so I knew that “Lift: elevator :: BONNET: car hood.”
Mr. Arbesfeld tells us that
the revealer, DOUBLEHEADERS, is a rarit
y in baseball nowadays, and I will happily take his word for it. His theme, however, drifts from baseball to a mix of homonyms and math.
The clue for the revealer is “Baseball rarities nowadays ... or a phonetic hint to the starts of 17-, 26-, 48- and 57-Across,” so the beginnings (or “headers”) of each theme entry are supposed to DOUBLE. Indeed they do, if you read the theme entries from top to bottom.
For example, at 17A, the answer to the clue “Was barely victorious, as in boxing” is WON ON POINTS (again, I’ll take his word for it). WON is a homonym for the number “one,” and when you move down to the next theme entry, the theme entry header has doubled. In TOO DARN HOT (which makes its New York Times debut), the TOO is a homonym for the number “two.”
Keep moving down the list of theme entries and the TOO doubles to FOR, which then doubles to ATE. Or rather, two doubles to four, which then doubles to eight.
Almost finished solving but need a
bit
more help? We’ve got you covered.

EAST LANSING, Mich. — A Michigan State University student who accused counseling center staff of discouraging her from reporting a 2015 rape by three men's basketball players said Thursday that she is no longer afraid and wants to encourage other ""silent survivors"" of sexual assault to tell their stories.
Bailey Kowalski, 22, who will graduate in May with a biology degree, held a news conference on the fourth anniversary of the alleged incident. She spoke a day after going public with her name for the first time in a story published by The New York Times.
""This isn't a burden they have to carry on their own,"" she said of other rape victims, as her parents, brother and lawyer looked on inside a hotel meeting room near the East Lansing campus. Kowalski, who cried at times, said her decisions to sue the university a year ago and to identify herself now were influenced by watching victims of disgraced former university sports doctor Larry Nassar come forward.
""It empowered me to do it,"" she said.
The suit, in which Kowalski is listed as Jane Doe and the now former ""notable"" players are not identified, alleges that she was 18 on April 12, 2015, when she met the players at an East Lansing bar about a week after the team lost in the Final Four. She was later taken to one of the men's off-campus apartments, where the players took turns raping her in a bedroom, according to the complaint, which says she thought she might have been drugged.
She awoke a few hours later on a couch, caught a taxi back to her dorm room and contacted university counseling center staff about a week later. After telling a counselor that basketball players were involved, she said the staff discouraged her from notifying the police.
""I was intimidated, and I was told that I was going to be swimming with some really big fish,"" Kowalski said Thursday. ""I'll never forget that phrase and the immediate feeling of despair and isolation.""
She said she has nothing to be ashamed of and there are other victims.
""I want to be an example for them. These silent survivors matter and they're worth fighting for. They hide in plain sight of all of us,"" she said. ""Lastly, I want the system surrounding Michigan State University to change, and I want all people to be treated with dignity and respect regardless of their status or the revenue they bring to the university.""
The suit, which was amended in December, points to past alleged sexual assaults involving MSU athletes, including two separate 2010 incidents in which a total five basketball players allegedly raped women and were not charged or disciplined. It alleges that the university violated Title IX requirements and Kowalski's rights by failing to follow normal reporting and investigative procedures when athletes were involved, actively discouraging victims from filing reports and not notifying them of reporting and confidentiality options.
Kowalski, who was studying to be a sports journalist before the encounter, has no plan to file a police report but is not ruling it out completely, said her attorney, Karen Truszkowski.
Kowalski said she went from being a ""bleed green Spartan fan"" as a freshman to not caring that the team made the Final Four this year. She said she would have filed a police report if she had known that she or her friends would not get into trouble for using fake IDs at the bar, and she would have had a rape kit done if not for fears that her parents' insurance would be billed.
""I was terrified to tell anybody,"" she said.
The school declined to comment on the lawsuit because it hasn't been resolved. Last year, though, it said Kowalski was treated appropriately by counselors, and it denied that she was discouraged to file a Title IX complaint or to contact the police.
The university opened a Title IX investigation after learning of the suit. The review is ongoing.
""We are committed to listening to survivors who bravely tell us about their experiences so that we can improve our response and help those who seek support in the future,"" school spokeswoman Emily Gerkin Guerrant said in a statement Thursday.

This story has been corrected to show that the attorney's last name is Truszkowski instead of Truszkowki. The spelling of Kowalski's last name was also corrected in one reference.

LONDON — Debenhams' lenders took control of the ailing British retailer on Tuesday in a process designed to keep its shops open at the expense of shareholders, including an irate Mike Ashley, who were wiped out.
Once the country's biggest department store chain, Debenhams had been hit by a sharp slowdown in sales, high rents and ballooning debt, plus an acrimonious power struggle with billionaire Ashley's Sports Direct.
Administrators were appointed on Tuesday after Ashley's last-ditch bid to rescue the company failed. They sold the group to its creditors including British banks and U.S. hedge funds.
Ashley, the owner of Premier League Newcastle United, had spent tens of millions of pounds building up a 30 percent stake and months trying to wrest control of the business.
He reacted angrily to the move. It was ""nothing short of a national scandal"", he said, with the board of Debenhams ""playing its part through incompetence, or worse, through collusion.
""Whilst these hedge funds look to close a significant number of stores and put thousands of people out of work, as politicians and regulators look on, I will go to the ends of the earth to save as many Debenhams stores and jobs as I can,"" he said.
Tuesday's deal will keep Debenhams' 166 UK stores trading for the time being, administrators from FTI Consulting said. Suppliers, workers, pension holders and customers will also not be affected.
But they said an existing plan to close 50 underperforming stores and demand rent cuts was ""critical"" to its survival. The restructuring puts about 4,000 jobs at risk.
Debenhams' descent into administration is another blow to a retail sector already reeling from the collapse of BHS, music store HMV, electronics firm Maplin, department store House of Fraser and cycle shop Evans. The latter two were snapped up by Ashley.
""It is disappointing to reach a conclusion that will result in no value for our equity holders,"" Chairman Terry Duddy said.
""However, this transaction will allow Debenhams to continue trading as normal, access the funding we need and proceed with executing our turnaround plans whilst deleveraging the group's balance sheet.""
WIPE OUT
In business since 1778, Debenhams has been battling for survival after a consumer shift online and to cheaper outlets left it with too much retail space on struggling high streets, destroying 90 percent of its share value in the past year.
With a flagship store on London's Oxford Street, the group was too slow to adapt.
Its stores - among the largest on Britain's retail map - are burdened with high rents, business rates and staffing levels, while it has had to discount heavily to drive clothing sales.
At the time of its collapse it had debt of up to 720 million pounds ($940 million) and a market valuation of just 22 million pounds. In 2018 it had 19 million customers and 2.9 billion pounds in sales.
Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Laith Khalaf said it had been downhill for the group since it floated on the stock market - for the third time - in 2006.
""We can still expect Debenhams to continue trading, though store closures are inevitable as Debenhams cuts its cloth to fit today's increasingly digital retail environment,"" he said.
It also has stores in Ireland and owns Denmark's Magasin du Nord.
Debenhams' new owners have put the chain up for sale, so Ashley could still play a role but he would likely need to take on large parts of the retailers' debt, Khalaf said.
Ashley had offered a rescue plan, but with the condition he was appointed chief executive. With tensions increasing between the two sides, Ashley even demanded that Debenhams board members take lie detector tests.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters that Debenhams feared that if Ashley became CEO he would renege on his financial promise and put it into administration himself, allowing him to select only the stores he wanted to own.
Sports Direct said that, following the administration, it did not intend to make an offer for the company.

BRISTOL, Tenn. — A day after it was announced that Darrell Waltrip would end his broadcasting career this year, the three-time Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series champion sat down and spoke with the media about his legendary career behind the wheel and in the television booth.
""Some people have thought that this was a spur-of-the-moment decision, something that I decided to do over the last two or three weeks,"" Waltrip said Friday at Bristol Motor Speedway, where he won 12 times. ""That is so far from the truth. ...
""Anybody that's done what I've done, whether it's a driving career or a TV career, you can always look back and say 'maybe should have done something different, maybe I should have thought about this or maybe I should have thought about that.'
""This is my home. For 60 years of my 72 I was holding on to something. I was holding on to a steering wheel for 30 years; I let go of that wheel and I grabbed on to a microphone. And I held on to a microphone for another 19 years. I've always been holding on to something.""
Waltrip, along with Mike Joy and former series crew chief Larry McReynolds, made up the original booth talent for FOX Sports when the network began NASCAR coverage in 2001. The move to television came after a driving career that saw Waltrip win series championships in 1981-82 and 1985 as well as 84 races.
In 2016, three-time series champion Jeff Gordon joined Waltrip and Joy in the booth.
As a racer in the early 1970s, Waltrip rocked the established stars of the day almost from the moment he arrived on the scene. By the end of the decade, he was winning multiple races and contending for championships. He was both loved and loathed as a competitor by fans and fellow drivers alike.
His career as a broadcaster was equally notable as he quickly helped merge two very different eras of the sport, identifying seamlessly with the older established followers while teaching a younger audience the ins and outs of NASCAR.
Mike Helton, vice chairman of NASCAR, noted that Waltrip has made ""a remarkable impact on a lot of people personally but on our industry in general.
""I count my blessings as I get older about those that I have been able to share my career with, but you're right there among the top,"" Helton told Waltrip. ""You're a remarkable person.""
Waltrip will remain in the booth for the remainder of the FOX portion of the 2019 racing season, which concludes June 23 at Sonoma (Calif.) Raceway.
A replacement has not been named.
""They say you get what you give,"" Waltrip said. ""Well, I gave a lot. But I got a whole lot more in return.""
BLANEY HOPES TO TRANSFORM EARLY SEASON SPEED INTO WINS
The speed has been present nearly every race. There is no disputing that, as Ryan Blaney has had a fast car capable of contending in all seven Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series races this season.
But while Blaney has had speed and led the third-most laps, that speed has not translated into winning. Instead, happenstance and miscues have contributed to what Blaney acknowledges has been a frustrating season heading into the Food City 500 on Sunday at Bristol Motor Speedway (2 p.m. ET on FS1, PRN and SiriusXM NASCAR Radio).
""There are moments you get frustrated at it,"" Blaney said. ""You just wish stuff would stop happening.
""The good thing is we've had speed all year. Honestly, I think we've had cars good enough to win almost every single one of them -- at least have a shot at them.""
Blaney's season began by crashing-out of the Daytona 500, a race he spent the majority of running up front before being collected in a multi-car accident with 10 laps remaining. Then came consecutive 22nd-place finishes at Atlanta Motor Speedway and Las Vegas Motor Speedway, where again Blaney's No. 12 Team Penske Ford was among the fastest cars on the track but mistakes and luck prevented him from contending.
Then came last week, when the gremlins that inflicted Blaney to start the season returned at Texas Motor Speedway. He was leading when his car began billowing smoke, later diagnosed as a parts failure that caused the water to leak out and caused the engine to blow. In a race where he led 45 laps, Blaney finished 37th.
""We had that run there of really good finishes like we finished where we had been running,"" Blaney said. ""I wouldn't say it's relieving, but it was nice to finally actually not have anything go wrong in those races. And then, you look at last week leading the race and a part falls off and we end up blowing up. That part is frustrating.""
NASCAR XFINITY SERIES DASH 4 CASH KICKS OFF THIS WEEKEND
Saturday's Alsco 300 NASCAR Xfinity Series race brings additional incentive for four drivers -- the series' seventh race is the first for this year's Dash 4 Cash bonus program.
Tyler Reddick (Richard Childress Racing No. 2 Chevrolet), Christopher Bell (Joe Gibbs Racing No. 20 Toyota), Chase Briscoe (Stewart-Haas Racing No. 98 Ford) and Michael Annett (JR Motorsports No. 1 Chevrolet) qualified for the opening round of the program based on their respective finishes a week earlier at Texas Motor Speedway.
The highest finishing Dash 4 Cash-eligible driver in any of the four races -- consecutive stops at Bristol, Richmond (Va.) Raceway, Talladega (Ala.) Superspeedway and Dover (Del.) International Speedway -- earns a $100,000 bonus.
The drivers agree on one thing -- competing in a Dash 4 Cash event is very similar to NASCAR's season-ending playoffs. The goal is to win the race but finishing ahead of the other qualifiers will be enough to collect the six-figure bonus.
""At the beginning ... you still want to win the race,"" Bell noted. ""But at the end of the race, if you're not in position to win, then it really changes. It almost kind of relates to the final four at Homestead because you're only racing three other competitors.""
Reddick says his approach is the same as it would be for any race, but that ""you kind of look at it like a cutoff (elimination) race.
""I'll pay closer attention to Chase and Michael than I have in the past ... obviously me and Christopher have been pretty even about everywhere we've gone this year.""
Said Annett: ""I definitely think it comes into play when it's not your day, you can turn it into it and not necessarily have to win the race. That's the biggest thing -- taking chances that you probably wouldn't for a fifth- or sixth-place finish.""
NATALIE DECKER READIES FOR NASCAR K&N PRO SERIES EAST DEBUT
Natalie Decker, 21, will make her NASCAR K&N Pro Series East debut Saturday at Bristol Motor Speedway, competing in the Zombie Auto 150 for DGR-Crosley. A native of Eagle River, Wis., Decker recently returned from Spain where she was one of 28 finalists competing for 18 spots in the new all-female W Series.
While she failed to make the final cut, Decker said the experience was unforgettable.
""It was amazing and so wonderful,"" Decker said. ""I'm so happy I did it. I have a lot to learn in road racing; I had never done that before.
""It was really cool to get that experience and I learned a lot. Maybe one day I can race an F3 car, but I really don't want to do that now. I really want to focus on (NASCAR). I really wanted to do the W Series just because of what they were doing for women and being a part of that.""
Decker has made three starts for the DGR-Crosley team this year in the NASCAR Gander Outdoors Truck Series. Her best finish was 13th at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.
Bristol's fast, high-banked, 0.533-mile layout left a quick impression.
""When I first pulled in, I was getting dizzy just trying to look at everything,"" she said. ""I couldn't imagine what it would be like when I got out on the track.
""It was totally different. I come from short-track racing, but this is a whole new level of short-track racing. I've raced at Slinger Speedway (in Wisconsin) and that's a really banked track but this is just totally different.""
NASCAR HALL OF FAMERS WALTRIP, ALLISON TO SERVE AS PRE-RACE DIGNITARIES
Legendary racers Darrell Waltrip and Bobby Allison will serve as pre-race dignitaries for Sunday's Food City 500. Allison will give the command ""Gentlemen, start your engines,"" while Waltrip will wave the green flag from the flag stand to officially start the race. The two NASCAR Hall of Fame drivers combined for four Cup Series championships and 168 victories. ... John Hunter Nemechek (GMS Racing) paced the first of two Xfinity Series practices at BMS while Cole Custer (Stewart-Haas Racing) led the final session. ... Harrison Burton, son of former NASCAR Cup driver Jeff Burton, is making his Xfinity Series debut at Bristol. The youngster was seventh fastest in the opening round and 13th in the latter session. ... BMS officials announced a multi-year extension with race sponsor Food City on Wednesday. The regional grocery chain has held the naming rights to the spring MENCS event since 1992. It is the second longest race entitlement in the series. Coca-Cola has been the primary sponsor for the annual Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway since 1985.

MINNEAPOLIS — Lee Larkins first got his hands on Kyle Guy as an Indiana sixth-grader who might as well be shooting free throws with his eyes closed.
""I shot with two hands, kind of like (motions his hands over his forehead and pushes, palms high, in opposite directions),"" Guy, now a junior at Virginia, said Sunday, about 16 hours removed from the heroic game-winning free throws that sent the Cavaliers to the national championship game and Auburn home from the NCAA Tournament.
A self-described slasher in middle school, Guy grew into a sharpshooter. There's a Jimmy Chitwood -- the sweet-shooting Hickory High School guard in the film ""Hoosiers"" for the uninitiated -- on every block in Indiana, where hoops is a religion and virtually all other things take second billing. Not just on winter Fridays in high school gyms. Parents get the ball bouncing on the same day they toss the baby booties.
Guy credits, in part, his middle school guidance counselor, Larkins. Guy's recollection was Larkins, who played football at Purdue and later coached there after playing middle school for Mike Fratello, forced him to work out with him.
""I have two daughters and they're a little bit older than Kyle. He used to come into the gym, always had a basketball in his hand,"" Larkins told Field Level Media on Sunday afternoon. ""It started as -- he went against all girls. All girls and him.""
Larkins is not the only basketball mentor in Guy's life, although he remains a constant. So when Guy strolled to the line with the game hanging in the balance Saturday night with 0.6 seconds left, the Larkins family started celebrating. That included Larkins' two older daughters who were part of the Kyle Guy Construction Project.
""He was built for this. This is what I texted him last night. Right away, my mindset is that he's knocking these three down. This is what he trained his mind for,"" Larkins said.
""At the end of every workout, we shot free throws with his eyes closed. He had to be at 80 percent. There was no doubt in my mind, this kid is going to make these shots. That same scenario, I guarantee you, he's played it out in Lawrence Central's gym. It's a mindset we were trained on.""
Larkins only had to open the door once for Guy to keep showing up at practices. He begged to be coached hard, and picked up nuances of the game on the fly.
Before long, Larkins had no doubt about Guy's destiny.
""We constantly worked on his shot, but he wanted to be coached and loved to be coached hard,"" said Larkins, who now runs an AAU program and has coached women's basketball at IUPUI.
""His grandmother was my boss. And then I told her and his dad, I said, 'This kid can be Mr. Basketball.' He picked up everything. Worked so hard. In my gym, I'm pretty fundamentally sound: Don't fade away, straight up and straight down. He picked up from there. It shows now. Just a really good shooter.""
Not everyone peered through the same optimistic lens evaluating the spindly Guy, who floated under the radar of many major college programs. Larkins said his alma mater, Purdue, was not a fit because it already had slots filled -- hello, Carsen Edwards -- in which Guy would have fit.
""Virginia was a natural fit,"" Larkins recalled.
""I tried to get him to Purdue. His grandfather and great grandfather are all (Indiana University) people. Kyle wanted something different. He wanted to get away, and write his own story. I think that was so much different than anyone else.
""Virginia was a great fit. When coach (Tony Bennett) came here and watched him, they were playing Lawrence North at the time. You could just see the relationship he had with Coach. It was a perfect, perfect match.""
The trust evident between Bennett and Guy paid off in a big way again Saturday. But Guy wants his original support system to know he's taking the court for them, too, on Monday.
""I've been thinking about that a lot the last three weeks,"" Guy said. ""Not just what it would mean to win a championship with these guys, but to bring it home and represent my hometown and Indiana.""
* * *
Measured and reflective, Guy comes across as vulnerable with overtones of on-court confidence. He models his openness after his coach, Bennett.
It might not have been evident to observers when Guy, who shoots 86 percent from the free throw line, sealed Virginia's win Saturday, but he battles extreme anxiety. He looked calm. He told himself he was calm. In reality?
""I was terrified,"" Guy said. ""But it was a good terrified.""
Pressure typically feels like a privilege until it has buckled you.
""The best thing I could do for Kyle is I pray for him a lot,"" said Bennett, who identified five biblical pillars of his program and uses faith-based teaching daily.
""I do, and I'm there for him. We have a saying: be kind because everyone you meet is facing a hard battle. Some things you have to work through with yourself and the right kind of help, and he's very honest about it. I try to encourage him and challenge him in ways and be there for him, coach him hard.
""We always talk about encouragement and accountability -- being that way with him. I constantly think about him. It's an extended family, so you are a father figure, to an extent, to them. I think about that stuff, and I do that for me. That's really important for him. That's probably the best thing I could say I did.""
* * *
Historically improbable, Virginia lost to UMBC in the first round of the 2018 NCAA Tournament. The March 16 defeat wasn't just an upset -- it was the first time a No. 16 seed knocked off a No. 1 in tournament history -- it also was an emotional landmark for Guy.
At the time, it felt like a landmine. The impact settled well below the surface when the team bus required a police escort back to Virginia's hotel in response to death threats.
Guy didn't know where to turn. He went into a shell and tried to close himself off from society. The 20-point loss felt to Guy like a nightmare from which he couldn't, and seemingly wouldn't, escape.
Fighting out of the pit wouldn't be a point-to-point venture.
Anxiety medication. Sports psychology. Sessions with Bennett. All of it helped. Nothing cured Guy.
He wrote himself a series of letters and ultimate liberation came through a social media post. Guy poured out his heart and soul into the emotion-charged writing at the behest of fiancee Alexa Jenkins.
""When that final buzzer sounded, I cracked. I cracked and the pressure got to me,"" Guy wrote in a Facebook post 39 days after the UMBC loss, unwinding and expelling almost 2,500 words of pulverized anguish.
""If you know me or read my last passage you know I do not believe pressure is real, unless you let it be real. Pressure comes from thinking too much about the future or past so there can be such thing as no pressure if you just be where your feet are. Well I was right where my feet were but my mind raced to the past, the future, and the present. It was too much. I was hit with an overwhelming feeling of sadness, anxiety, and failure. All the sensations of that exact moment consumed me and I was no longer in control of my emotions.""
* * *
Writing became a necessary form of therapy. He shared, he asked and listened. And most important to Guy, he refused to forget. It didn't take away the shame and the sting is still there -- but it is now suspended intentionally by the 21-year-old.
His cellphone wallpaper and Twitter avatar are still set to the March 16, 2018, loss to UMBC. Soon enough, Guy says he'll let it go. And if you wonder how often a 21-year-old college athlete checks a cellphone -- ""a lot.""
""It still stings every time I look at it,"" he said.
But Guy crept out of his shell. He firmly believes a hand guided him here, to Minneapolis, to Monday night, to the precipice of a story of overcoming failure by refusing to repeat history.
It helped that when he felt like he was drowning a year ago, his mom reminded him his lifeguard walked on water.
He felt an unspeakable presence on the Virginia team outing -- white-water rafting, the high-class kind that might not be a wise choice for someone battling anxiety -- and an unshakable calm that emerges in-game with a smile that stretches to his earlobes.
""In a way, it's a painful gift,"" Bennett said of how the UMBC loss propelled Virginia to this point.
""It did draw us nearer to each other as a team. I think it helped us as coaches. I think it helped the players on the court and helped us in the other areas that rely on things that were significant. I knew it was going to be a really important marked year for all of us in our lives, and it's certainly playing out that way.""
* * *
That echo helped carry Guy in this very NCAA Tournament, when he endured a shooting slump from 3-point range -- 3 of 29 -- that put the Cavaliers in peril in two of their first three games. Then came the regional final. Guy collected 21 points after halftime, 25 in all, and Virginia bounced Purdue to reach the Final Four.
Six points in the final 10 seconds on Saturday is now the string of splash plays Guy can recall when he rewinds his journey on and off the court.
""I think all of my life has led to this. Everything that I've been through made it a lot easier to hone in and try to knock down the free throws,"" Guy said Sunday. ""I said that I was terrified. It was a good terrified, though, a good nervousness in my stomach like, 'This is my chance.'""
The climactic final chapter comes Monday.
Pressure is a privilege Guy would never consider passing on this time around. Imagining scissors fitted around his fingers to trim the nets hanging at U.S. Bank Stadium won't bring anxiety Sunday night or Monday. Even knowing Texas Tech could be the team climbing the ladders to celebrate becoming champions brings a peaceful smile to Guy's face.
""Every player and coach on every team has envisioned it, I'm sure,"" he said. ""But I think it's important to realize that you don't get to skip the game and just go down and cut the nets. We've got to focus on what's in front of us. We've got to practice (Sunday) ... and just focus. We're excited.""

“I wanted to understand why I kept shooting myself in the foot. I wish it was in the foot, actually.”
A-Rod on doping, getting therapy and no longer being the villain.
Alex Rodriguez has, in retirement, fashioned a comeback that far exceeds any reversals he engineered on a baseball field. It wasn’t all that long ago that the former Yankee was one of professional sports’ biggest bad guys, and not without reason. He was suspended for the 2014 season for violating the league’s antidoping rules. Even aside from that, he was widely considered to be vain and disingenuous, especially in his hometown. (The New York Post honored him with “A-Hole” and “A-Rat” cover lines, following allegations that he used performance-enhancing drugs.) But three years after his last game, Rodriguez, newly engaged to Jennifer Lopez, is a respected baseball broadcaster, a warm and self-deprecating presence on social media and a deferential businessman. You couldn’t exactly call his image rehabilitation
organic
, given how hard he’s worked at it, but it has no doubt been successful. “I tried to build a certain image while I was playing,” Rodriguez said, “and that plan failed miserably.” Now, he explained simply, “I have more clarity.”
What have you learned that would ha
v
e made
dealing with the press
1
easier as a player?
What I’ve learned is that a lot of it was self-inflicted.
What specifically?
I represented myself the wrong way.
Coming out of the suspension,
2
I wanted to be honest, be accurate and be fair with the media — and mix in levity. I could not wait to make fun of myself. Doing that made everybody relax about me. I’d wake up the next morning thinking I was going to get crushed by them for a mistake I’d made. But then I’d see that they’d barely be talking about my [expletive] up because I’d beat them to the punch. I still think that, for the most part, I had a good relationship with the media, but it became excellent postsuspension.
Did the depiction of you as a villain feel like a misrepresentation?
I would have booed me, too. I felt that being the tough guy who had all the answers and being robotic was the right thing to do. I was wrong, and now I think it’s O.K. if I say, “I don’t know the answer.”
This is almost more of a philosophical thing, but baseball has a long history of players using performance enhancers —
“Ball Four”
3
talks about guys gobbling amphetamines before games. And I’m thinking of that in conjunction with a point
Malcolm Gladwell once made
4
in The New Yorker, about how players aren’t allowed to take P.E.D.s, but it’s O.K. for them to get Tommy John surgery, which is also a completely unnatural method of aiding your career. Does it seem at all arbitrary that baseball says P.E.D.s are cheating but certain other things aren’t?
I don’t know. I think, with time, we’ll be able to determine what’s what.
Of all the big-time baseball players who were implicated during the steroids era, you seem to have done the best — better than guys like Barry Bonds or Roger Clemens — at coming out of that controversy in a positive way. Why is that?
I cannot speak about anybody else. If you’re asking about me, I think it started with taking full responsibility for my missteps. I paid a huge price: the longest suspension in the history of M.L.B. for P.E.D. use. And while I was away, I took that year to reflect. I wanted to understand why I kept shooting myself in the foot. I wish it was in the foot, actually.
What understanding did you arrive at?
I’m still a work in progress, but one thing I learned was that I was good enough. I did not need to overreach. And when I turned the lens inward, I found this incredible amount of gratitude and appreciation and respect for others and myself in a way that perhaps was not there in the past. With that attitude, I was able to enjoy life better. It made me a nicer person to be around; it made me a better father.
Before making the personal realizations you’ve described, how distorting was fame to your self-conception and decision-making?
I went to my high school prom, and several months later I was playing at Fenway Park. I was good enough physically to be there, but mentally, I was still in high school. I never make excuses for myself, but not benefiting from being on a college campus for four years and having the time to evolve — I lost my way somewhere along the line.
How aware were you of any emotional disconnects in the moment?
You know when something doesn’t feel right. What you find is that — and I’ve never thought about it this way before — you suppress that voice that’s telling you not to do the wrong thing.
This is maybe a shot in the dark, but did the suspension really cause this 180-degree epiphany for you? Or was it maybe more that it — and its aftermath — gave you a way of understanding your own story that allowed you to move forward emotionally and publicly?
Well, when the suspension first happened, I was pissed off at everyone. I was blaming everyone. It wasn’t until I got deeper into it that I said: No, it’s not their fault. It’s your fault.
Were you in therapy at the time?
That’s when I got into it.
Is there any culture of therapy in major-league baseball?
What’s more common in baseball is performance coaches. That’s totally different than deep therapy, which is serious business. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do. In many ways, it’s rewiring the brain.
Before your suspension, did you or your advisers ever discuss just coming clean about P.E.D.s? Or was the strategy always deny, deny, deny?
This part, I want you to make sure that we’re superclear. Because I want this to be a story that’s about the facts, and it’s not me trying to [expletive] you. I think I didn’t have the tools that I have today. Let’s go to the next one, David, and we’ll come back to this, because that’s real important. I want to make sure that I address that in a clear way.
How consciously, as you’ve transitioned out of playing, have you tried to build a new brand or persona for yourself?
Today I showed up here with you, and I didn’t know anything you’d want to talk to me about, and I’d rather have it be that way. Before, I would have studied for six months before sitting down with you. I wanted to be more buttoned-up and have done due diligence and seen what your angle was. Now I just trust we’re going to have a good conversation, and I go for it.
What persona or brand were you trying to build back then?
Robotic, tough. Very serious.
How did that Details photo shoot where you were kissing your reflection in a mirror fit in with that image?
I cringe at that.
5
We were ending the photo shoot, and I wanted to run out of there. I think Steven Klein was the photographer, and he was like, Let’s just shoot one more. And I’m like, What? I just want to eat a burger. Let me get out of here.
Were burgers part of your diet back then?
No, but I was probably starving. Yeah, I just kissed the mirror, not even thinking. But I did a lot of things like that. I took my shirt off at Central Park and
decided to get sun in the middle of the day.
6
Knowing that people would see you and take photographs, right?
In Central Park?
Yes.
No. Because you think you’ll just do this for 15 to 20 minutes and get some sun. I’m pale as hell. Again, even those situations, if I would have handled them with some levity and more humility, I would have defused the entire thing.
There’s that rumor about your having a portrait of yourself as a centaur.
100 percent not true. I wish it was true because it’s such a cool story.
What has
Jennifer Lopez
7
taught you about being a public figure? She’s obviously skilled at it.
I’ve never met anyone who’s more honest. She’s so authentic and genuine. It was strange to see someone of such magnitude be so normal, be such a great mother and partner and friend. How can you be like this and then go perform in front of 80,000 people? But that’s her superpower.
Why has balancing your public and private selves in that way been more of a struggle for you?
I don’t know. I wish I did.
How hard was the cultural transition from sports to business?
There’s financial language that’s different, but in other ways, they’re exactly the same. What you want to do is create a winning culture, where incentive packages are based on the team winning. If you’re not careful and you put in the wrong incentive packages, you can create a culture where everyone is fighting for themselves. The same thing goes in baseball.
There is that expectation in sports that players will sacrifice themselves for the benefit of the team. But if each professional athlete is his or her own business, aren’t the personal incentives fundamentally at odds with the incentives of the team’s management, who are rewarded for team performance? Or is the whole ethos of subsuming your individual self-interest into the team’s a bunch of romantic horse crap perpetuated by those who have a vested interest in
athletes’ continuing to think that way?
8
Look, I played for 22 years and
won one championship.
9
Dan Marino and Charles Barkley — they didn’t have championships, and to this day I know they hear the echoes. I feared that. So ’09 was an amazing experience, but the other half was relief. But I also had already made a small fortune. It’d probably be different if you asked me
when I hadn’t signed my contract.
10
Then that becomes a question of would you rather hit .330 and not win or .270 and win? That’s where it gets a little tricky.
Because that batting-average difference equates to a difference of millions of dollars in salary?
Tens of millions. But there are unique players that are truly all about winning. Johnny Damon, Derek Jeter, Andy Pettitte, Dustin Pedroia.
Do you include yourself on that list?
I do. I do. I also had an incredible passion to be great. But yeah, probably I do. That’s why I moved over to third base from shortstop. That’s an example of putting the team ahead of myself.
Your life as a baseball player was so regimented. Do you miss that structure?
I have as predictable a schedule as I can, but nothing will be as predictable as a baseball season. I was in love with that structure. I had a list of my 10 things I had to do, and I would check it every night before I went to bed to see how many I’d done. I was maniacal about my work ethic. When I was about 19 years old, I played with a
guy by the name of Joey Cora.
11
He’s 5-foot-7 on a good day, he had knee problems and I saw him arriving at the stadium at 11 in the morning for a 7 o’clock game. I saw the way he took care of his body — all the work he did to get ready to play. And here I was a young shortstop hitting .358. I’m going down the stretch competing for the M.V.P., and nothing hurt. I felt like I could rip through a wall, and the wall would hurt, right? God, those were the good old days. But I remember sitting down and watching Joey Cora, and I’m like, His body hurts. He doesn’t complain. He just gets to the clubhouse earlier and earlier. And I said, If I can take my God-given ability and have his type of hunger and desire, I’ll take my chances.
Do you still have a checklist you look at every night?
I do. I’m old school. I remember things better if I write them out. The other day, Jennifer said something brilliant at, like, 2 in the morning. I reached over to get my notebook, and everything falls on the floor. Then I grabbed it and wrote it down.
What’d she say?
It was about Mariano Rivera. She said, “
Mo getting 100 percent
12
tells you more about his greatness off the field than it does on the field.” I thought, That’s so true. I played with him all these years, and I couldn’t have come up with that.
When you were playing, did you ever see another player and think he was better than you?
If you take away my first year and my last season, I don’t think I ever saw that.
Would the answer be different if you’d played against Barry Bonds?
I played against Barry. Interleague.
Do you look up to anyone in the business world the way, as a kid, you looked up to, say, Cal Ripken?
Think about what Jamie Dimon has done at J.P. Morgan. Barry Sternlicht at Starwood. Jon Gray at Blackstone. Obviously, our Babe Ruth is Warren Buffett.
Buffett’s philanthropy is impressive.
My passion in giving back is for education. I’ve had an opportunity to co-teach a class at Stanford Business School.
What was the class?
Reputation management.
Was the key lesson authenticity?
That was definitely up there. And not being afraid of pivoting.
Something a shortstop is good at. How did getting rich at a young age change your relationships with the people around you?
You have a young kid who learned how to play baseball at the Boys & Girls Clubs. Then you climb through the system, you become the No. 1 draft pick. You bypass college. At 21, you get over $10 million in a contract, which is crazy. Then you get a contract that breaks the all-time record in sports. Usually journeys have an arc of many years, but this all happened to me in seven or eight years after high school. So it was a culture shock for me and those around me. There’s no preparation for it.
What were the effects of that culture shock?
People around you think that you have all that cash. Whatever they read in the paper you signed for, they feel like someone came in a Brink’s truck and dumped all the money in your garage. And for whatever reason, some people think, Where’s my cut? When that doesn’t happen for them, it can grow into resentment and disappointment.
Let’s revisit the question I was asking earlier. Before being suspended, was the idea of coming clean about P.E.D.s ever discussed?
I’ve taken the position of just owning everything. At some point, and maybe it’s in the future, I feel like this is an answer I would like to give on-camera because I think people have to see my sincerity. I’m giving it to you straight because I respect you and I don’t want you to think that I’m [expletive] you in any way. So that’s why I’d rather step away and say, “David, I’d rather not answer that because I’m not ready to give that truth yet.” Does that make sense?
I think I understand what you’re saying. What’s the one piece of advice you have for other athletes trying to transition into business?
You have to find people that are experienced, conservative, have alignment with you and have a moral compass. There are so many pitfalls along the way, and if someone doesn’t have a moral compass, there’ll be trouble.

Viktor Arvidsson completed the comeback -- and set a franchise record in the process -- as host Nashville scored five unanswered goals to beat Chicago 5-2 on Saturday night and claim the top spot in the Central Division on the final night of the regular season.
The Predators (47-29-6, 100 points) will face the Dallas Stars in the opening round of the Stanley Cup playoffs. They are on a roll, having won eight of their last 11 games down the stretch to claim a second consecutive division crown.
Arvidsson -- with his 34th goal of the season, a new standard for a Predators skater -- broke a 2-2 deadlock with a power-play goal 3:33 into the third period. As the Predators rushed up the ice, Arvidsson received a cross-ice pass inside the blue line and wired a shot that ended up the game winner.
Late goals by Colton Sissons, his into an empty net, and Nick Bonino rounded out the scoring for Nashville, which received a 31-save performance from goalie Pekka Rinne.
Jets 4, Coyotes 2
Mark Scheifele and Kyle Connor collected a goal and an assist as visiting Winnipeg posted a win over Arizona in both teams' regular-season finale at Glendale, Ariz.
Nikolaj Ehlers and defenseman Jacob Trouba also tallied, and Connor Hellebuyck made 19 saves for the Jets (47-30-5, 99 points), who recorded just their second win in their last seven games (2-4-1).
Winnipeg, which finished second in the Central Division, will have home-ice advantage when it faces St. Louis in the first-round of the playoffs. Nashville's victory over Chicago earlier on Saturday ended the Jets' bid to claim the Central title.
Blues 3, Canucks 2 (SO)
Ryan O'Reilly and David Perron scored goals in a shootout as host St. Louis beat Vancouver.
The Blues (45-28-9, 99 points) briefly moved into first place in the Central Division, but the Predators wound up as division winners for the second straight season after defeating Chicago. St. Louis was in last place in the NHL on Jan. 3 but finished in third and has become the hottest team in the league since then. They will face second-place Winnipeg (47-30-5, 99 points) in the first round of the playoffs.
The Canucks, who will miss the playoffs for the fourth straight year, completed 2018-19 with a 35-36-11 mark for 81 points.
Lightning 6, Bruins 3
Steven Stamkos and Nikita Kucherov each scored to reach career milestones as visiting Tampa Bay matched an NHL record with their 62nd victory, a win over Boston.
The Presidents' Trophy-winning Lightning (62-16-4, 128 points) equaled the 1995-96 Detroit Red Wings' mark for single-season wins. They also posted the fourth-most points ever in a season and became the second team in league history to win 30 road games.
While the Lightning rested key performers Brayden Point and goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy, Stamkos posted his 45th goal for a career-high 98th point, and Kucherov scored his personal-best 41st goal as the visitors scored four straight to erase a 2-0 deficit. Kucherov, who added an assist, finished with an NHL-leading 128 regular-season points -- the most by a Russian-born player in league history.
Canadiens 6, Maples Leafs 5 (SO)
Ryan Poehling scored three goals in regulation, including the tying goal in the third period in his NHL debut, then added the winner in a shootout as Montreal ended its season by defeating visiting Toronto.
Jordan Weal and Andrew Shaw each had a goal and an assist for the Canadiens, who had been eliminated from the playoffs. Nicolas Deslauriers and Artturi Lehkonen each added two assists.
Zach Hyman had a goal and an assist for Toronto. Jake Gardiner, Trevor Moore, William Nylander and Kasperi Kapanen also scored for the Maple Leafs, who will face the Boston Bruins in the first round of the playoffs.
Blue Jackets 6, Senators 2
Pierre-Luc Dubois scored twice as Columbus defeated host Ottawa in the regular-season finale.
The Blue Jackets, who had already clinched one of the Eastern Conference's two wild-card playoff berths, hoped to gain the top wild-card slot and avoid Tampa Bay in the first round of the postseason. But those hopes were dashed when Carolina beat Philadelphia to edge the Blue Jackets (47-31-4, 98 points) by one point in the standings.
Markus Nutivaara, Alexandre Texier, Oliver Bjorkstrand and Riley Nash also scored for the Blue Jackets, and goaltender Joonas Korpisalo made 27 saves.
Sabers 7, Red Wings 1
Jeff Skinner scored twice to reach the 40-goal mark and Buffalo closed out its season with a thumping of host Detroit.
Rasmus Dahlin supplied a goal and an assist. Sam Reinhart, Conor Sheary, Zemgus Girgensons and Brandon Montour also scored for the Sabres (33-39-10, 76 points). Linus Ullmark made 23 saves.
Skinner reached the 40-goal mark for the first time in his nine-year career. He also had 32 even-strength goals this season. That gave him the most even-strength goals by a Sabre since Alexander Mogilny (49) in the 1992-93 season.
Devils 4, Panthers 3 (OT)
Travis Zajac scored a power-play goal 56 seconds into overtime as New Jersey defeated host Florida.
Nathan Bastian, a 21-year-old who was New Jersey's second-round pick in 2016, scored twice for the Devils and now has three career goals in seven NHL games. Pavel Zacha scored New Jersey's other goal, and 22-year-old rookie Mackenzie Blackwood made 37 saves.
The Panthers got goals from Jonathan Huberdeau and Mike Hoffman in the final four minutes to send the game to overtime. Aleksander Barkov also scored for the Panthers. It marked his 35th goal of the season, and he set the franchise record with his 95th point to break the previous record set by Pavel Bure (94) in the 1999-2000 season.
Hurricanes 4, Flyers 3
Jordan Staal scored the go-ahead goal in the second period as visiting Carolina completed a season sweep of Philadelphia.
Staal joined Teuvo Teravainen in collecting a goal and assist for the Hurricanes (46-29-7, 99 points), who clinched the top wild-card spot in the Eastern Conference and will face Metropolitan Division champion Washington in the first round of the playoffs.
Warren Foegele and defenseman Justin Faulk scored for the second consecutive contest, Brock McGinn notched a pair of assists and Curtis McElhinney made 28 saves in the win.
Rangers 4, Penguins 3 (OT)
Ryan Strome scored on a wrist shot from the left dot at 2:09 of overtime to give visiting New York a win over Pittsburgh.
Pittsburgh's playoff lot came down to Saturday's results on the final night of the regular season. The Penguins (44-26-12, 100 points) finished third in the Metropolitan Division and will be the road team in a first-round series against the New York Islanders.
Brendan Smith, Brady Skjei and Vladislav Namestnikov also scored for the Rangers, who are out of the playoffs and finished 32-36-14 for 78 points. Goaltender Alexandar Georgiev made 36 saves.
Islanders 3, Capitals 0
Valtteri Filppula, who missed the previous eight games due to injury, scored twice and goalie Robin Lehner stopped all 29 shots he faced as New York clinched home-ice advantage in the playoffs for the first time in more than 30 years with a win over host Washington.
With the win, the Islanders (48-27-7) locked up third place in the Metropolitan Division and home ice against Pittsburgh for a first-round postseason series. It is the first time New York has held home ice since the 1987-88 season, which was the longest active home drought among the four major North American sports leagues.
The shutout also ensured the Islanders would allow the fewest goals in the league after allowing the most last season, when they missed the playoffs by 17 points. Lehner's shutout was his career-high sixth and the team-record 11th of the season.
Stars 3, Wild 0
Tyler Seguin scored twice in the first nine minutes of the third period, and that's all goaltender Ben Bishop needed as Dallas defeated visiting Minnesota to clinch the Western Conference's first wild-card spot.
The Stars (43-32-7, 93 points) are in the postseason for the first time since 2016 and enter the Stanley Cup playoffs as the seventh seed in the West. Dallas won five of its final seven games and will play Nashville, the Central Division champion, in the first round, with the schedule to be determined.
The Wild (37-36-9, 83 points) won only four of their final 14 games and missed the playoffs for the first time in seven seasons. Minnesota was shut out 11 times this season and managed only 24 shots in the loss.
Oilers 3, Flames 1
Leon Draisaitl's 50th goal of the season was overshadowed by Connor McDavid sustaining an injury early in the second period as visiting Edmonton beat Calgary.
McDavid was driving to the net when he was tripped up by Flames captain Mark Giordano and went crashing into the post, his left shin taking the brunt of the force. He remained on the ice for several minutes and didn't put any weight on his leg as he was helped to the dressing room. Giordano was assessed a tripping penalty on the play.
Edmonton took advantage of the ensuing power play with Alex Chiasson netting his 22nd goal of the season. Flames goalie Mike Smith couldn't contain Oscar Klefbom's point shot, and Chiasson pounced on the loose puck for the eventual game-winning goal.
Kings 5, Golden Knights 2
Ilya Kovalchuk scored two goals and Anze Kopitar had a goal and an assist to lead host Los Angeles to victory over Vegas.
Jeff Carter and Matt Roy also scored goals for Los Angeles, which finished last in the Western Conference for the first time since 2007-08 with 71 points and a 31-42-9 record. Dustin Brown added a pair of assists.
Jonathan Quick finished with 29 saves to pick up his 309th career victory, fourth best among U.S. born goaltenders in NHL history. Quick, pulled after giving up seven goals on 25 shots in a 7-2 loss to Calgary in his previous start on April 1, finished the season with a 16-23-7 record.
Sharks 5, Avalanche 2
Even before the opening faceoff of its road loss to San Jose, Colorado knew its fate as hopes of claiming the first of two Western Conference wild-card playoff berths were dashed when Dallas defeated Minnesota earlier in the evening.
That means Colorado (38-30-14, 90 points) will play Calgary, who finished second in the President's Trophy race behind Tampa Bay. The Sharks (46-27-9, 101 points), who finished second in the Pacific Division, will face Vegas in the first round of the playoffs.
Evander Kane and Gustav Nyquist each had a goal and an assist for the Sharks, who won for just the third time in their last 12 games (3-8-1). Brent Burns, Kevin Labanc and Micheal Haley also scored, Tomas Hertl notched two assists and Martin Jones made 28 saves.

BALTIMORE — Chris Davis has tied the major league record for the longest hitless streak by a position player, going 0 for 46 during an unproductive run that began last year.
Baltimore's highly paid first baseman was retired in his first two trips to the plate Monday night against Oakland, leaving him hitless in 25 at-bats this season. Combined with his 0-for-21 finish in 2018, Davis is tied with Los Angeles Dodgers infielder Eugenio Velez for the lengthiest run of futility by a non-pitcher, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.
Velez went hitless in his final nine at-bats of the 2010 season before going 0 for 37 in 2011 and eclipsed the previous longest hitless streak, shared by Pittsburgh's Bill Bergen (1909), Dave Campbell of San Diego and St. Louis (1973) and Milwaukee's Craig Counsell (earlier in 2011).
This isn't the first dubious record owned by Davis. He batted .168 last year, the worst batting average in major league history for a qualified player.
Davis is in the fourth season of a $161 million, seven-year contract.
The 33-year-old has two RBIs this season — on a bases-loaded walk and a forceout. He's struck out 13 times.
On Monday, he lined out to right field in the second inning against Marco Estrada and matched the record hitless streak in the third with an opposite-field fly to left. Before the record-tying out, Davis got a second chance when second baseman Jurickson Profar dropped his foul pop to right.
Manager Brandon Hyde was asked before Monday's game whether he considered resting Davis rather than insert him in the lineup against Estrada.
""He really wanted to play today,"" Hyde said.
Davis entered hitting .167 (6 for 36) with three homers against Estrada.
Hyde has done his best to be patient with Davis.
""I was hoping he'd get off to a good start and he would play well early and hit,"" Hyde said. ""I'm pulling for him. I'm trying to put him in position for success and I talk to him a lot. He's up front with it.""
Davis has been getting booed by the home fans after his strikeouts.
""Fans are welcome to handle situations the way they want to,"" Hyde said. ""Unfortunately, it's hard to listen to for me.""

LOS ANGELES — Former U.S. President Barack Obama praised the legacy of slain Los Angeles rapper Nipsey Hussle on Thursday in a letter read during a public memorial attended by thousands of fans, many of them dressed in white.
Obama's letter to the family was read by Karen Civil, Hussle's friend and business partner, on a stage filled with white, pink and blue flowers. The former president praised Hussle's attempts to revitalize the gang-plagued neighborhood where he was raised, and where he was gunned down last month.
""While most folks look at the Crenshaw neighborhood where he grew up and see only gangs, bullets and despair, Nipsey saw potential. He saw hope,"" Obama's letter said.
""To build a skills-training center and a co-working space in Crenshaw; to lift up the Eritrean-American community; to set an example for young people to follow -- is a legacy worthy of celebration,"" he added.
The 21,000-capacity Staples Center, a sports and pop concert venue, was packed for the two-hour memorial, to be followed by a 25-mile procession through the streets of south Los Angeles.
Frank Sinatra's song ""My Way"" played over a photo montage of the 33 year-old singer's life. Hussle's two year-old son, dressed in a blue suit, was brought on stage in the arms of the musician's girlfriend, model Lauren London.
Stevie Wonder was expected to perform and California rapper Snoop Dogg was among friends, ministers and family members scheduled to speak.
Security was tight because of Hussle's former gang connections. Last week, a stampede erupted at a local vigil for Hussle after reports of a gunman in the crowd.
Hussle, who had parlayed his fame into a role as a community organizer and activist combating gang violence, was shot on March 31 outside a clothing store he owned in south Los Angeles.
""He lived the gang life but he didn't stay there. He lived the life of the 'hood but he rose above the pull of gravity,"" Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan said in a speech.
Farrakhan said Hussle has become ""to hip hop and rap what Bob Marley was to reggae.""
Los Angeles police last week arrested a 29-year-old man who has pleaded not guilty to murder charges. Police said the shooting was motivated by a personal dispute, although it took place against a surge in gang-related violence in south Los Angeles.
Hussle, whose real name was Ermias Asghedom, was Grammy-nominated earlier this year for his debut studio album ""Victory Lap.""

HONG KONG — Chinese game-streaming company Huya Inc, backed by Tencent Holdings Ltd, raised $327 million in a follow-on share offering, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday.
Huya, which went public last year in New York, is part of a growing trend of Chinese tech companies returning to capital markets for cash soon after their initial public offering (IPO).
Huya sold 13.6 million primary shares at $24 each, the people said, a discount of 1.36 percent to its closing price of $24.33 on Tuesday. At the same time, social media platform YY Inc sold 4.8 million of Huya shares, bringing the total proceeds of the sale to $442 million.
Huya did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
There is an over-allotment - or greenshoe option - of up to 15 percent for Huya's share sale, meaning the firm could raise as much as $375 million if exercised. There is likewise a 15 percent over-allotment for YY's stake sale.
Huya is China's biggest live-streaming game platform, according to the offering prospectus, competing with Douyu which plans to go public in New York this year.
China boasts the world's largest gamer base in e-sports with about 266 million gamers in 2018, the prospectus showed.
Huya's shares have risen about 55 percent since the firm's IPO in May, in which it raised $180 million.
U.S.-listed Chinese companies have raised $4.24 billion in follow-on share sales and convertible bonds so far this year, Refinitiv data show, the best start to any year in 15 years.
Other companies from the 2018 IPO cohort returning for more funds include electric vehicle maker NIO Inc, video streaming company iQIYI Inc, e-commerce firm Pinduoduo Inc and video platform Bilibili Inc.
Bankers are pinning their hopes for 2019 on additional capital raising through follow-on offerings or convertible bonds as the crop of Chinese companies looking to go public thins out after a blockbuster 2018 in terms of IPOs.
Many of the companies that went public in 2018 raised less money than they had hoped for - partly due to global market jitters and partly because investors pushed back against lofty valuations - which will drive follow-on capital raising.
Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs and Jefferies are joint bookrunners for the Huya deal.

LOS ANGELES — A soccer fan says in a lawsuit that the California Department of Motor Vehicles violated his First Amendment rights by rejecting a personalized license plate he said would celebrate his favorite team, but which the DMV determined might be deemed offensive.
Jon Kotler applied for a plate that would read ""COYW,"" an acronym of the slogan ""Come on You Whites"" used by supporters of London-based Fulham Football Club, according to the federal lawsuit filed in Los Angeles on Tuesday. Fulham players wear white jerseys.
In denying the proposed plate, the DMV said the abbreviation could ""have racial overtones"" and carry ""connotations offensive to good taste and decency,"" according to the court filing.
The department's rejection of the application violated his right to freedom of speech, said Kotler, a lawyer and constitutional scholar at the University of Southern California Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.
The Department of Motor Vehicles said Tuesday that it does not comment on pending lawsuits.
Kotler's suit asks the court to declare the Department of Motor Vehicles' criteria for personalized license plates unconstitutional. He also wants the department to pay his court costs.
""You can't allow bureaucrats to make decisions that are fundamental to what it means to be an American, and our free speech is one of those things,"" Kotler said in a news release. ""When the government starts to infringe on our rights, that's when the individual citizen must speak up.""
In its rejection letter to Kotler, the Department of Motor Vehicles acknowledged the difficulties in balancing ""an individual's constitutional right to free speech and expression while protecting the sensibilities of all segments of our population.""
In a 1973 case, the California Court of Appeals upheld the Department of Motor Vehicles' standard of ""good taste and decency"" in rejecting a plaintiff's claim that his free speech was violated when the department rejected his requested license plate, ""EZ LAY.""
Constitutional scholar David L. Hudson said courts are often split in cases claiming censorship over personalized plates.
""It appears in this case that the government has engaged in regrettable censorship of Mr. Kotler's speech,"" said Hudson, who teaches at Tennessee's Belmont University and is a fellow at the Freedom Forum Institute. ""To me courts should be very sensitive to viewpoint discrimination and should err on the side of protecting the individual's speech from government censorship.""
Kotler is being represented pro bono by the libertarian-leaning nonprofit Pacific Legal Foundation. The group criticized the Department of Motor Vehicles' ""attempt to make itself the speech police"" in a statement announcing the lawsuit.
""You can call Jon a sports fan or a First Amendment expert, but the DMV's misguided efforts to regulate license plates have misbranded Jon as a racist,"" the foundation said.

(Reuters) - A family of eight known as the ""Hart Tribe"" died last year in a murder-suicide when their sports utility vehicle plunged off a 100-foot (30 m) cliff in northern California, a coroner's inquest said on Thursday.
The mystery over why the family from Washington state perished in March last year on a scenic cliffside highway, about 180 miles (290 kms) north of San Francisco, garnered national attention.
A 14-member jury ruled that the deaths were the result of a ""murder-suicide"", Mendocino County Sheriff-Coroner Thomas Allman told a press conference late Thursday after a two-day inquest.
""This was held so the truth can come out,"" he said. ""We needed to know the facts of this case.""
The eight family members - two women and their six adopted children - are believed to have been in the GMC Yukon in March 2018 when it accelerated to about 90 mph (144 kph) and drove over a cliff, authorities said.
The bodies of Jennifer Hart and her partner Sarah Margaret Hart, both 38, were found in the vehicle which landed upside down, police said.
The children were Markis, 19; Hannah, 16; Devonte, 15; Jeremiah, 14; Abigail, 14; and Ciera, 12.
The bodies of four children were later recovered. A fifth child was linked by DNA to human remains found in a shoe on the coast about one mile (1.6 km) north of the crash site.
The remains of Devonte have never been found, Allman said.
Devonte, an African-American, drew international attention in 2014 when he was photographed embracing a white police officer at a rally to protest the shooting of a black teenager in Ferguson, Missouri.
The two Hart women died by suicide, Allman said. The deaths of the six children were ruled to be murders.
There was no known motive, Allman said.
Jennifer Hart is thought to have driven the car off the cliff three days after child protective services in Washington state opened an investigation into allegations she and her partner had neglected or abused the children.
A police autopsy has shown that Jennifer Hart was legally drunk at the time of the crash.
Three children, along with Sarah Hart, tested positive for an ingredient commonly found in the allergy drug Benadryl, which can make people sleepy, the sheriff's office has said.
""The Hart family is hopefully resting in peace,"" Allman said in officially closing the case.

WASHINGTON — For Donald Trump, the rigid rules of golf are flexible, allowing for the kick of a wayward ball into a better location, skipping a putt that looks close enough. What's the big deal?
That is according to Rick Reilly, a former Sports Illustrated columnist who has just written the book ""Commander in Cheat,"" which alleges Trump is guilty of all sorts of sins on the golf course.
In an interview with Reuters on Thursday, Reilly laid out a number of accusations to support his view that the U.S. president's golf game is, well, not par for the course, particularly for a president who owns a string of golf resorts.
Among the charges: Playing with pros Tiger Woods, Dustin Johnson and Brad Faxon in November 2017, Trump hit two balls in the water on one hole but didn't charge himself any penalty strokes.
The pros all saw it happen, but just grinned their way through it. Why didn't they call him out for the violation?
""Because he's so fun and we want our own stories to tell about the cheating,"" Reilly said he was told.
At Winged Foot, a famous golf club in Westchester County, New York, Trump had a reputation among the caddies for kicking his ball into a better position so often that they called him ""Pele,"" the former soccer star, Reilly said.
While Trump has in the past claimed a golf handicap of 2.8, meaning he typically will average three strokes over par over 18 holes, his handicap is actually about 10, said Reilly.
""This idea that Donald Trump is a great golfer - he's not,"" said Reilly. ""He's good. He’s a 72-year-old man who’s a 10 handicap. That’s pretty good. But why isn’t that good enough?""
One time Democrat Hillary Clinton, who Trump defeated in the 2016 election, had her brother, Hugh Rodham, to play a round at Winged Foot but showed up wearing shorts and was told he had to have long pants, Reilly said.
Rodham ended up wearing Trump's rain pants in order to meet the dress code, and gave them back when he was done. This didn't sit well with Trump when he found out about it.
""Somebody tells Trump this and he was so mad he made the club buy him a whole new rain suit,"" said Reilly.
Reilly said the point of the book is to show what Trump is really like behind the scenes.
""Golf is a window into a guy’s soul and this gives a pretty good view of the guy,"" he said.
The White House declined to comment.

Catlin was lining up for a shot at Olympic gold. And an elite mathematical mind would open opportunities off the track. But torment lurked behind the success.

WABASHA, Minn. — In the weeks before the Olympic cyclist Kelly Catlin killed herself, she felt her mind slipping.
She could not focus on her schoolwork at Stanford, where she was a first-year graduate student in computational mathematics. In an email she sent to her family, a coach and a friend in January, she said her thoughts were “never-ending spinning, spinning, spinning” as if they were “never at rest, never at peace.”
She wrote that she cried about it, and that made her feel even worse. For years, Catlin, 23, was someone who took pride in holding back tears.
Catlin told her sister, Christine, that seeking therapy meant she was weak and that she would rather suffer. She told her brother, Colin, that she thought she was going insane and she worried that she was a danger to others because she was filled with rage.
She wrote that she was scared of dying.
“What is it like to no longer have a mind?” she wrote in January, just days before a first suicide attempt. She answered the question.
“It is unimaginable,” she wrote. “Terrifying.”
Catlin was poised for stardom at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, where she had a reasonable shot for Olympic gold that eluded her in 2016. With the advanced degree from Stanford she was working toward, she could have her pick of jobs in computers.
How, those who knew her are asking now, could she find no purpose to keep living? How could she be so unknown to the people closest to her?
Kelly Catlin had sought to explain herself and her distress, both over the phone and in notes before she was found dead in her Stanford apartment on March 8. In one note she wrote in January, she even asked, “What do you wish to know?”, leaving a trail of cryptic answers.
“You think you know your children,” her mother, Carolyn Emory, said, “but there was so much about Kelly, especially this secret personal code she lived by, that was startling to me in the end. She was very private.”
On Friday, a month after she killed herself, a white van showed up at her parents’ farmhouse to drop off her things.
Three bikes. Nearly a dozen boxes of clothes, books and cycling gear. Her carbon-fiber violin. Duffel bags stuffed with cycling gear and United States Olympic team uniforms from the 2016 Rio Games, where she won a silver medal.
Her mother and her brother, Colin Catlin, sifted through the belongings, retrieved from her apartment. Her father, Dr. Mark Catlin, could only join them in spurts because he was so distraught.
Every item provoked a memory, none a clue.
Colin Catlin had hoped to find telling information on her phone, but instead he found the wallpaper she selected for it haunting: an album cover featuring a body with daggers in its back. The album title was “Try to Die.”
He broke into tears.
It was hard to absorb that just months before, in November, on the podium at a World Cup track cycling race, where Catlin’s squad finished second in the team pursuit, she soaked in the moment: flags waving, fans cheering, adrenaline pumping. A three-time world champion, Catlin considered the victory a prelude to finally winning an Olympic gold medal.
Off the track, she was fulfilling a lifelong obsession with numbers and order through her academics and planning for a career in Silicon Valley.
This solid trajectory she appeared to be on had made her mental downward spiral and death all the more mystifying to teammates, friends and family members.
Catlin’s father, who is a pathologist, blames her suicide on a combination of factors, including her success-at-all-costs personality, overtraining, stress, and physical injuries from a January suicide attempt about a month before she was found dead in her dorm. On both occasions, she inhaled noxious gas.
But the breaking point, he and other family members believe, was a concussion she sustained during a training ride on Jan. 5. They have donated her brain to researchers to find out if the head injury contributed to her behavior changes.
Regardless of the results, nothing can give the family a definitive answer. Suicide is much more complicated than lab results can reveal and multiple factors, like destabilizing life events, brain chemistry and persistent mental struggles, almost always come into play.
“I wake up every two to three hours at night to go through all of these permutations on what could have saved her,” said her father, whose eyes were reddened by weeks of crying. “I can’t help but wonder what she would’ve done with her life.”
Kelly’s mother answered, weeping, “Something great.”
Catlin and her triplet siblings, Christine and Colin, grew up in Arden Hills, Minn., a suburb of Minneapolis. Her parents — her mother is a former Alzheimer’s researcher — met in a lab dissecting brains.
The Catlins lived in a large house with an indoor gymnasium. They took European vacations and roasted s’mores in the backyard. They were a family of introverts who enjoyed staying at home for tea parties. For Kelly, Christine and Colin, school and sports were equally important. They excelled at both.
Kelly was the super-focused athlete, a first-chair violinist who studied nonstop. Christine was the creative writer and runner who played three instruments. Colin was the math whiz who played guitar and rode bikes competitively. In middle school, the siblings tied for Most Likely to Succeed.
“Our parents always told us that we could be great at anything we wanted to, if we worked hard enough,” Christine said. “Looking back, maybe we kind of twisted that into thinking we weren’t worth anything if we weren’t the best. I think Kelly believed that.”
Kelly’s parents said she was an intense child who grew socially awkward with age. In elementary school, when she could not figure out addition or subtraction, she would scream for hours in frustration, they said, and refused to take a break.
For years in her youth, she was obsessed with horses. She studied the 512-page book “The Ultimate Book of the Horse and Rider” so much that she had to tape the binding because the book was so worn. She maintained a collection of dozens of model horses that she did not allow anyone to touch because they were arranged in a certain order.
Christine Catlin described her sister as a once outgoing, friendly girl who began closing herself off in middle school because she was “so obsessed with success.”
Kelly Catlin also began to limit her social interactions to “robotic social motions,” as Catlin herself put it in the January note to family and friends. Around third grade, Catlin established her lifelong code to live by and included some of it in the note, which was shared with The New York Times:
Fear not physical discomfort. Never love. Never engage in a relationship that could be defined as having a significant other. (In my case, a so-called “boyfriend.”) Never allow yourself to become close enough to another that their actions or inactions might cause you (any amount of) distress or pain. If kindness and gentleness are at all an option, they are the only option.
“We all knew that she didn’t like to express her emotions,” Christine Catlin said. “She never really told anyone how she ever felt, until the very end, that is.”
Colin and Christine Catlin were cycling for a local development team, NorthStar, when Kelly quit high school soccer and joined them, at Colin’s prodding. She loved long training rides and used cycling as a way to practice memorization, another passion.
She would remember dozens of license plates of cars passing her and would recite the number pi to hundreds of decimals, Colin Catlin said. She mapped out training routes in her head.
“She liked that cycling kept her mind focused, but I think she liked it most when she started winning everything,” said Colin, a data scientist. “Her mentality was, if you wanted to be an Olympian, all you had to do was train hard.”
And Kelly did make it seem easy. Within two years of starting to race, she was invited to the United States Olympic Training Center in Colorado, where coaches put cyclists through testing to see if they are national team material. Kelly was that, and more.
Her power output on the stationary bike was higher than every other recruit and higher than several athletes on the national track cycling team, said Neal Henderson, one of the coaches back then.
Track cyclists compete on a banked oval, called a velodrome, and Catlin seemed suited for it because it required both power and precision.
She was drawn to the science of cycling. She wasn’t comfortable with the social aspect of it. In the notes she wrote in her final weeks, she acknowledged not having many friends.
“It’s not that she didn’t want friends,” her brother said. “It was just a matter of priorities. And her priority was to be successful and respected.”
Like her siblings, Catlin could not stand to be hugged, family members said. She would rather bury herself in a book than chat with peers. She had a playful sense of humor — often dark humor — within her family circle, but rarely showed it to outsiders.
Although she exuded confidence, she described in a note having a “phenomenally powerful fear of social embarrassment,” and also long worried that she would not be able to keep up with other cyclists, said Charlie and Sherry Townsend, the co-founders of her development team. It was a classic impostor syndrome, they said.
“But she changed because of cycling, she really did,” said Sherry Townsend, a psychologist, adding that Catlin’s self-esteem rose after she competed in the Olympics. “She was slowly learning how to be better engaged with people, slowly learning how to share her thoughts with others. But it was still hard to really know her.”
Catlin’s nickname at the Olympic Training Center, where she lived before the 2016 Olympics, was Roy Orbison, because she always wore dark glasses. She wore her hair short because it was practical for the sport, so short that she was sometimes mistaken for a young man.
Chloé Dygert, an Olympic teammate, said she was thrilled when Catlin started to open up, even occasionally agreeing to a quick hug. Dygert and a teammate once convinced Catlin to play the violin for them.
“It was, like, whoa, so good that it was jaw-dropping,” Dygert said. “Kelly was just amazing. She read a book every day, even while brushing her teeth, and it was hard to keep up. She was a lovely girl on the inside.”
The concussion that her family said changed everything happened on Jan. 5 when Catlin crashed while riding with her professional road cycling team, Rally UHC Cycling. A team spokesman said there was “no indication that she hit her head or had a serious injury” when the team evaluated her.
But at a national team training camp two days later, Catlin felt dizzy and could not continue working out. She told the team about her crash. Medical personnel at the Olympic Training Center placed her on concussion protocol and suggested rest, said Guillermo Rojas, a spokesman for USA Cycling.
Yet Catlin continued to complain to her parents of headaches, sensitivity to light and trouble sleeping. And this was coming months after a fall in October that left her with a broken arm and weakened interest in the national team.
“There was this profound apathy,” her father said. “She didn’t care about winning medals anymore.”
Life at Stanford was much different than she was used to. She moved into a dorm there after living with her brother at the University of Minnesota while finishing her undergraduate degree. Colin had cooked her meals and often had to trick her into taking breaks from studying and training, playing episodes of the television show “Stargate” because she could not resist science fiction.
At Stanford, she spent a lot of time alone because her roommate, a law student, was often not there.
After the concussion, Catlin simply could not focus anymore on school or cycling — or anything. In late January, she wrote that she had started planning her suicide before her crash and concussion. But her family thinks that was not true.
“For the first time in her life, Miss Stoical couldn’t force herself to go on,” her father said, choking up. “This is when she began planning her suicide.”
After her first suicide attempt, Catlin spent about a week in a hospital psychiatric ward. When she left that treatment, she began attending group therapy sessions, which she deemed useless, her parents said, and she said she could not find an available psychiatrist who met her needs.
When Catlin moved back into her on-campus apartment, her parents flew home to Minnesota to give her space, telling her, “We love you, we want you alive,” her father said. They banked on her assurances that she wouldn’t try to kill herself again. She had given her word, a part of her personal code they knew.
“She fooled us all,” her mother said.
The suicide attempt and concussion had damaged her brain and heart, her family said, so competing at the world championships on Feb. 27 was not possible. The day the championships began, Catlin wrote a blog post in which she described managing her cycling career with her graduate studies as “juggling with knives” and said, “I really am dropping a lot of them.” In a note she wrote in March, she said, “If I am not an athlete, I am nothing.”
Looking back, her father said, it was clear she needed time for her brain to heal, but it appeared nobody could impress that on her.
He said her lifelong resolve played a big factor in trying to kill herself again.
“She was furious that she survived her first suicide attempt,” her father said.
Christine Catlin’s phone rang in late February, and it was Kelly. They had not spoken at length in years because they were busy with their own lives after high school, but now Kelly wanted to talk. Christine found it strange. It was nothing Kelly would have done before her concussion.
Kelly said she worried that the physical effects of her concussion or her first suicide attempt — or both — were affecting her judgment.
She asked: What could Christine see her doing in the future?
The sister answered: You could do public speaking about suicide awareness and help people. Or you could do remote computer programming so you don’t have to be around people. You could own a farm and be around horses all day.
“You could bike, if you want to,” Christine said. “Or not.”
Kelly seemed to feel better after the call, which lasted two and a half hours.
Still, she told Christine, “If things don’t change in a month, I’m probably going to kill myself.”
Christine begged Kelly not to do it.
“O.K.,” Kelly said, with a tone Christine now realizes was less than convincing.
The call was over. Christine rushed to call her parents, and for days afterward the family repeatedly checked on Kelly. Two weeks after that conversation, Catlin’s life was over.
At a memorial service in Minneapolis on March 23, Kelly Catlin was dressed in the uniform the United States team wore for the Rio Games opening ceremony, and the majority of her pallbearers were her cycling teammates. She was buried at the foot of a 50-foot oak tree at Lakewood Cemetery, near one of her favorite bike paths.
Before the coffin was closed, her sister, Christine, slipped in a handwritten note that included these words:
Kelly, if I could trade my life for yours, I would. I love you without all your accomplishments.

Experimental brain scans of more than two dozen former N.F.L. players found that the men had abnormal levels of the protein linked to chronic traumatic encephalopathy, the degenerative brain disease associated with repeated hits to the head.
Using positron emission tomography, or PET, scans, the researchers found “elevated amounts of abnormal tau protein” in the parts of the brain associated with the disease, known as C.T.E., compared to men of similar age who had not played football.
The authors of the study and outside experts stressed that such tau imaging is far from a diagnostic test for C.T.E., which is likely years away and could include other markers, from blood and spinal fluid.
The results of the study,
published in The New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday
, are considered preliminary, but constitute a first step toward developing a clinical test to determine the presence of C.T.E. in living players, as well as early signs and potential risk.
Thus far, pathologists have been able to confirm the diagnosis only posthumously, by identifying the tau signature in donated brains.
Previous studies had reported elevated levels of the tau signature in single cases. The new study is the first to compare the brains of a group of former players to a control group, using an imaging approach that specifically picks up tau and not other proteins in the brain.
“What makes this exciting is that it’s a great first step for imaging C.T.E. in the living, not just looking at single instances, but comparing averages and looking for patterns by comparing groups,” said Kevin Bieniek, director of the Biggs Institute Brain Bank Core at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio.
Dr. Bieniek was not involved in the study.
Over the past decade, the competition for research dollars to investigate C.T.E. has become fierce and political, with charges of exaggerated claims and interference by the N.F.L., which has produced scientific reports to rebut any link between the disease and repeated head trauma.
The group that develops the first useful clinical test stands to attract a surge of funding, not to mention potential commercial partnerships. At least
one group, in California, has already formed a company to promote its own test
.
The new study was led by Dr. Robert Stern of Boston University, which thus far has the largest collection of donated brains from former pro football players. He led a coalition of investigators at multiple centers who took brain images from 26 former pro players, aged 40 to 69, who had a variety of memory, mood and mental problems associated with C.T.E.
Those images showed marked elevation of tau proteins in the areas of the brain that display the tau signature when diagnosed post-mortem. The players’ tau signal in those areas was higher, on average, than the tau signal from a control group of men who had not played.
“We found, as well, that the amount of abnormal tau detected in these PET scans was associated with the number of years playing football,” Dr. Stern said.
His collaborators included brain scientists from the Mayo Clinic Arizona, Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Avid Radiopharmaceuticals. Avid makes a molecule, called a ligand, that binds to proteins, in this case in the brain. Avid’s ligand is the most studied of the so-called tau detectors, and the company helped finance the study.
Experts said the findings were encouraging, because any reliable marker for abnormal tau accumulation would allow doctors not only to identify people with C.T.E., but also to monitor progress from potential drug treatments.
But, these experts said, much more work is required to develop a reliable test for a disorder that is still not well understood. As in tests for people suffering from Alzheimer’s and other diseases that affect the brain, researchers have spent years trying to precisely refine the ligands that are ingested by patients before they receive PET scans and other imaging tests.
There are also many open questions about the tau protein that is a signature of C.T.E. Researchers are trying to determine whether the protein, which occurs naturally in the brain, accumulates faster in people who have received repeated head trauma, and how those accumulating levels are related to behaviors associated with C.T.E., which include not only memory deficits but also impulse control issues and symptoms of depression.
The new study found no correlation between the strength of the abnormal tau signature and the severity of cognitive and mood problems in the former players, though the sample was small.
The search for a test for C.T.E. in living patients has received intense scrutiny since the disease was first discovered in deceased professional football players 15 years ago.
The universe of professional players is relatively small — only about 2,000 active players and 20,000 retirees — and the Boston group’s work has been based on a sample of some of the worst cases. Many, perhaps most, pro football players do not develop disabling cognitive problems, and there are likely many other brain traumas that could potentially result in the C.T.E. tau signature.
Yet football is by far the country’s most popular sport, with more than a million high school students playing the tackle version of the game. The detection of C.T.E. in former pro players turned what was viewed as an occupational hazard into a public health debate. For years now, parents, coaches, school administrators, doctors and others have
engaged in a dispute
over
whether children should be allowed
to play collision sports.
Part of that dispute is trying to prove (or disprove) whether there is a direct link between exposure to repeated hits to the head absorbed in games like tackle football and the development of cognitive and neurological problems later in life.
Here, the science is emerging. Studies by Dr. Stern and other researchers, including in the paper just released, suggest that there is
a dose response — the more hits to the head, the more likely you are to develop problems later
.
But researchers have questioned studies that have shown a high percentage of deceased former football players found with C.T.E. They claimed that the research subjects were self-selected because the families of players who suspected they had brain disease were more likely to donate their brains to science.
Some researchers are looking at broader populations of people who have had traumatic brain injury, not just football players, to determine whether participation in collision sports, as opposed to genetics or other factors, is linked to the development of C.T.E.
“There’s a lot of lower-level head trauma out there that no one knows the consequence of,” said Dr. John Trojanowski, a research at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, who plans to submit a research paper in the coming months on people who have suffered traumatic brain injury. “We are looking at people with traumatic brain injury, football players, rugby players, some people who fell off bikes.”
Even when tau is found in PET scans, many other questions remain.
“Identifying the tau is just a first step,” said Dr. Alexander Powers, associate professor of neurosurgery, pediatrics and orthopedics at Wake Forest School of Medicine. “Is tau increasing in the brain? And what is the rate? Does it steadily increase? Or rapidly, like cancer? And what are the factors that led to it?”

AMSTERDAM — A photograph of a Honduran toddler crying as a U.S. Border Patrol officer pats down the child's mother in Texas was named as the prestigious World Press Photo of the Year at a ceremony Thursday evening.
Getty Images photographer John Moore's winning image shows 2-year-old Yanela Sanchez and her mother, Sandra Sanchez, after they were taken into custody last June 12, and it fueled debate about tough Trump administration policies that included separating families detained at the U.S.-Mexico border.
Time magazine published Moore's photo on its cover, producing anger over U.S. President Donald Trump's family separation program. But Yanela's father later told the British newspaper Daily Mail that his daughter wasn't removed from her mother and the two were detained together.
Time stood by its use of the image, saying it captured ""the stakes of this moment.""
""I think that this image touched many people's hearts as it did mine because it humanized a larger story."" Moore said in a statement released by the context organizers.
The image also won first prize in the ""spot news singles"" category as awards were announced for this year's contest, which drew 78,801 photographs by 4,738 photographers.
""It immediately tells you so much about the story. And at the same time, it really makes you feel so connected to it,"" jury member and photojournalist Alice Martins said in a statement about Moore's photo. ""This picture shows a different kind of violence that is psychological.""
Photos of the migrant crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border also won a new award in this year's contest — World Press Photo Story of the Year. Pieter Ten Hoopen of Agence Vu/Civilian Act, was honored for a series of pictures depicting migrants in a caravan heading toward the border.
""I wanted to focus on the human aspects, on relations between the people and how they handle it,"" Ten Hoopen said.
Moore and Ten Hoopen each won 10,000 euros ($11,268).
Among other winners, the ""contemporary issues singles"" category was won by Diana Markosian of Magnum Photos for an image of a Cuban girl called Pura being driven around her neighborhood in Havana in a pink 1950s convertible to celebrate her 15th birthday.
Olivia Harris won the ""contemporary issues stories"" category for a series called ""Blessed Be the Fruit: Ireland's Struggle to Overturn Anti-Abortion Laws.""
Another Getty Images photographer, Brent Stirton, won the ""environment singles"" category with a photo of Petronella Chigumbura, a member of an all-female anti-poaching unit in Zimbabwe. A series of images by Marco Gualazzini of Contrasto highlighting the crisis surrounding the drying up of Lake Chad won first prize in the ""environment stories"" category.
Lorenzo Tugnoli, of Contrasto, for The Washington Post won ""general news stories"" with images of the war in Yemen.
John T. Pedersen won ""sports singles"" for his image of boxer Moreen Ajambo training at a boxing club in Katanga, a large slum settlement in Kampala, Uganda.

LOS ANGELES — Ralph Lawler called his 3,229th and last regular season game for the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday night.
They even obliged his trademark Lawler's Law, which states the first team to 100 points wins.
Montrezl Harrell's dunk gave the Clippers that many points near the end of the third quarter and they went on to beat the Utah Jazz 143-137 in overtime.
The eighth-seeded Clippers open the playoffs this weekend against the defending champion Golden State Warriors.
Lawler, who turns 81 on April 21, plans to end his 60-year broadcasting career whenever the Clippers are eliminated from the playoffs. He's handled their games for 40 years.
""I love you people,"" he told the crowd that gave him a standing ovation during a halftime ceremony.
He noted many of them, including comedian Billy Crystal, have been coming since the Clippers played at the old Los Angeles Sports Arena in ""the darkest days any franchise could have only imagined. God love you for still being here.""
The recently named Hall of Fame broadcaster was joined by friend and former on-air partner Bill Walton to call the game at Staples Center.
""It's been 20 years or so since we worked together. I got to say two or three words in the first half,"" Lawler told the crowd. ""Reuniting with him has been a special night.""
Before the game, the team unveiled an on-court logo honoring Lawler, and the players wore special shooting shirts thanking him.
Team owner Steve Ballmer donned the same black-and-white ""Thank you Ralph!"" T-shirt over a long-sleeved shirt.
Fans signed an oversized card outside the arena and the first 10,000 received Lawler bobbleheads, which recite some of his signature phrases such as ""Bingo!"" and ""Oh me, oh my!""
""This is a night the likes of which I could never have possibly imagined,"" he said.
The Clippers made 12 3-pointers, with fans holding up placards reading ""Bingo"" and shouting it out on each one.
The team estimated that Lawler has traveled 1.67 million miles, called games in 91 cities in six countries, talked over 500,000 minutes on the air, and had a career longer than eight NBA franchises.
He's one of a few announcers who have called games in the four major U.S. pro leagues: the NFL's Chargers, MLB's Philadelphia Phillies, NHL's Philadelphia Flyers and NBA's Clippers and Philadelphia 76ers.
He's received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and three Emmy Awards.
Lawler met his wife, Jo, after leaving Philadelphia for San Diego to call Clippers' games and she was a season ticketholder.
The team presented them with a trip to Australia and New Zealand.
The Clippers announced the creation of a scholarship in Lawler's name at his alma mater, Bradley University in his hometown of Peoria, Illinois.

SYDNEY, Australia — Australian rugby officials said on Thursday that they intended to terminate the contract of a star player, Israel Folau, after he posted anti-gay comments on social media.
Mr. Folau, 30, a devout Christian who plays rugby union for both the New South Wales Waratahs and Australia’s national team, the Wallabies, posted an image on his
Instagram account
on Wednesday warning “homosexuals,” “adulterers,” “atheists” and others that “hell awaits you.”
“Whilst Israel is entitled to his religious beliefs, the way in which he has expressed these beliefs is inconsistent with the values of the sport,” Raelene Castle, the chief executive of Rugby Australia, and Andrew Hore, the chief executive of New South Wales Rugby Union, said in a
joint statement
.
“We want to make it clear that he does not speak for the game with his recent social media posts.”
The statement said both rugby organizations had made “repeated attempts to contact Israel” since Wednesday evening, to which he had not responded.
“In the absence of compelling mitigating factors, it is our intention to terminate his contract,” the statement concluded.
Mr. Folau signed a four-year, multimillion-dollar contract in February with the Wallabies and the Waratahs, both of which he joined in 2013 after six years playing rugby league and Australian rules football.
He is the fourth-highest try scorer in the Australian national team’s history, and on Saturday he became the leading try-scorer in the history of Super Rugby, a competition involving the Waratahs and 14 other teams from five countries. He has also been awarded the John Eales Medal for best Australian rugby player three times, more than anyone else.
His departure would leave the Wallabies without one of their top players less than six months before the Rugby World Cup, which starts in September in Japan.
Mr. Folau, a former Mormon who is now a member of the Pentecostal denomination Assemblies of God, has a history of making homophobic and transphobic comments.
On Tuesday, he
commented on Twitter
about the Tasmanian Parliament passing legislation to make gender optional on birth certificates, saying, “The devil has blinded so many people in this world, REPENT and turn away from your evil ways. Turn to Jesus Christ who will set you free.”
In September 2017, he
expressed his opposition to same-sex marriage
on Twitter even as his team, the Wallabies, was encouraging Australians to vote in favor of it in a nationwide postal survey.
Last April, Mr. Folau
posted a comment
on Instagram that God’s plan for gay people was “HELL” unless they “repent of their sins.” Rugby Australia issued him with a warning in response.
In a column later that month for
Players Voice
, an Australian sports site featuring writing by athletes, he wrote, “I do not have any phobia towards anyone.”
He also wrote: “This is not about money or bargaining power or contracts. It’s about what I believe in and never compromising that, because my faith is far more important to me than my career and always will be.”

DOHA/LONDON — Qatar filed lawsuits on Monday against three banks, accusing them of causing billions of dollars of damage to its economy by what it called overseas currency manipulation in the wake of an Arab boycott against Qatar in 2017.
The cases, filed in London and New York, name Luxembourg-based Banque Havilland, the United Arab Emirates' First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB) and Saudi Arabia's Samba Bank, according to filings seen by Reuters and a statement from Qatar's government communications office.
First Abu Dhabi Bank declined to comment, while Banque Havilland and Samba Bank did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
In the case, Qatar alleges Banque Havilland devised a plan to weaken the country's riyal currency on key composite indices by submitting thousands of ""fictitious and depreciated"" quotes, according to the court filings.
""But the quotes were phoney, as FAB, Samba Bank, and others repeatedly refused to transact with counterparties at the prices they were quoting in public,"" the filings stated.
The lawsuits are the latest fallout in a protracted Gulf row that began in 2017 when Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt imposed an economic boycott on Qatar in 2017, accusing it of supporting Islamist militants and Iran.
Qatar, a small Gulf state but major gas exporter, denies the charges and says the boycott is an attempt to impinge on its sovereignty.
The currency manipulation was intended to ""deplete Qatar's financial reserves so that it would be unable to complete its preparations to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup games, and would be forced to share the games with Saudi Arabia or the UAE,"" the filings stated.
UAE sports chief Mohammed Khalfan al-Romaithi has said his country and other Gulf states could co-host an expanded World Cup 2022, a measure global soccer body FIFA is expected to vote on in June but which Qatar holds the final decision over.
Qatar liquidated nearly $3 billion in U.S. treasury investments and drew down over $40 billion in foreign reserves after the alleged manipulation in a bid to support its currency, the filings stated.
With more than $300 billion in central bank reserves and sovereign wealth fund assets, bankers say Qatar has sufficient financial firepower to block attacks on its currency.
Its central bank began a probe into the alleged manipulation in late 2017 after it said unidentified banks were looking to attack the riyal by trading it between themselves offshore at artificially weak levels - to create an illusion Qatar's economy was crumbling.
""Qatar seeks to hold FAB, Samba Bank, and the unknown John Doe Defendants who conspired with them liable for the billions of dollars in damages that they have caused to Qatar, plus punitive damages and statutory interest,"" the filings stated.
They added elsewhere that Qatar also sought to hold Banque Havilland similarly responsible.

He beat the qualifying time for the race twice and still could not get in. This year he made it.
By
Jen A. Miller
Welcome to the Running newsletter! Every Saturday morning, we email runners with news, advice and some motivation to help you get up and running.
Sign up here
to get it in your inbox.
In 2017, I interviewed a few people who had technically qualified for the Boston Marathon but didn’t make it into the race. That’s because as demand for spots surged, Boston switched to rolling admissions, allowing the runners who beat the qualifying time for their age and gender by the most time to sign up first, and then moving down from there.
That made getting into the marathon a moving target, which was frustrating to runners who had trained thinking they knew what they had to do to qualify.
For the 2018 race, runners had to be three minutes, 23 seconds faster than the supposed “qualifying” time for their age and gender to get in; for this year’s race, which is being held on April 15, they had to be four minutes, 52 seconds faster.
One of the people I talked to in 2017 was Dan Hirschman, who just missed for both the 2017 and 2018 races. But for 2019? He’s in.
“I was absolutely ecstatic,” said Hirschman, who is now 45. He qualified for Boston by running the 2018 Myrtle Beach Marathon in three hours, 11 minutes, 52.5 seconds, well under the three hour, 25 minute qualifying time for a 45-year-old man, and more than eight minutes under what he actually needed.
As Hirschman predicted when I talked to him initially, his best shot at finally making it was moving up an age bracket, which gave him 10 extra minutes. Still, he said, “I felt such a sense of satisfaction that all that work had paid off because I knew that time would be enough. There was also this incredible sense of relief.”
For the 2020 race, qualifying times are getting five minutes faster across ages and genders. Hirschman is confident he can still do it, and will give it a shot on April 15.
“I fully intend to soak in the day and enjoy it, but I am definitely going to race,” he said.
Next week, I’ll have a full preview of the race and how The Times is covering it (and don’t forget
our event on April 13
— use code RUN for $5 off!) Until then, here are two things happening in the running world that you may want to know about:
First, The Washington Post recently published a story about accidents associated with BOB jogging strollers.
If you use one to run with your kids, this is a must-read.
(For more on jogging strollers, here’s
Gretchen Reynolds on how to run with one
.)
Second, Women’s Running (which I sometimes write for) recently posed an interesting question:
Should races have pregnancy deferral policies
? It’s inspired a
lively Twitter conversation
if you’d like to weigh in.

LOS ANGELES — Felicity Huffman is an Emmy-winning actress and has several buzzy upcoming projects, but her career faces a pivotal moment because of her real-life role in the college admissions bribery scandal.
Huffman may be sent to prison after agreeing Monday to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy and fraud for paying a consultant $15,000 disguised as a charitable donation to boost her daughter's SAT score. Prosecutors are seeking four to 10 months of confinement, and experts differ on whether the plea, and Huffman's subsequent apology taking full responsibility for her actions , will leave her with an acting career.
""I think she did the right thing in the tone of how she came clean, accepted guilt and taken the plea deal,"" said Laura Ries, co-founder at the advertising firm Ries & Ries.
""I think people want to give others a second chance, especially if you ask for forgiveness and show repentance that you're moving forward. Her next role might not come in two weeks or two months, but maybe in a year or two.""
""I think if money was exchanged, she should do jail time,"" said Jodi Gomes, director of ""One Child Left Behind: The Untold Atlanta Cheating Scandal,"" an upcoming documentary focusing on a group of educators convicted of boosting test scores to try to advance students. ""In doing jail time, that would kill her career.""
No matter what Huffman's fate is, she won't immediately disappear from viewers' screens.
She will play a prosecutor in the Ava DuVernay-directed ""When They See Us,"" a limited series on the Central Park Five case that will be released May 31.
But Netflix officials said Monday another film starring Huffman, ""Otherhood,"" will not be released as planned on April 26 and a new date will be determined. The romantic comedy also stars Patricia Arquette and Angela Bassett.
Huffman, 56, was among the stars of the popular ABC series ""Desperate Housewives,"" which won her an Emmy Award in 2005. The following year she was nominated for an Oscar for playing a transgender woman in the movie ""Transamerica."" Her credits include the TV series ""Sports Night"" and ""America Crime,"" for which she received three Emmy nominations.
Also charged in the admissions bribery scheme is ""Full House"" star Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli. Both were hit with new charges Tuesday .
The Hallmark Chanel already cut ties with Loughlin , but Ries believes Huffman won't endure the same fate.
""Certainly this isn't going to help her career,"" Ries said. ""But I don't think it's going to end her career. I think it's going to perhaps put a pause on it.""
While Huffman's career could be put on hold, Gomes said the actress could redeem herself by using her celebrity platform to advocate ""underrepresented students.""
""She should use her platform to advocate for others,"" she said. ""I'm tired of people getting away with bad behavior and then going on an apology tour and hoping that everything's OK. I think Felicity Huffman is getting kid gloves, because of who she is. If she gets kid gloves, at least she can do in redeeming herself is to use her platform to help others.""
Eden Gillott, president of Gillott Communications, said Huffman's next steps should eventually help fix a ""broken and inequitable college admissions system.""
""I think this needs to be a long commitment, because otherwise she will look opportunistic,"" she said. ""I think that working with an organization that's already in existence to elevate their mission and gain awareness to rid the admissions system of allowing the privilege to pay-to-play is probably her best bet.""

Seattle is feeling the pain from Boeing’s 737 Max crisis, but the aircraft manufacturer has weathered other tough challenges.
Boeing announced on Friday that it would slow production of its 737 planes in Renton, Wash., just outside Seattle.

SEATTLE — Just south of Seattle’s Boeing Field and the Museum of Flight sits another shrine to aviation, Randy’s Restaurant. Model airplanes are suspended from the 24-hour diner’s ceiling, with flight manuals and various dog-eared aerospace tomes strewn about its candy-colored booths.
Given its proximity to a major outpost of the Boeing Company, Randy’s has served more than its fair share of chicken-fried steak and brick-shaped hash browns to Boeing employees and their families, among them Ron Russell.
Mr. Russell’s son works at Boeing’s aircraft assembly plant in the city of Everett, where he used to install doors on 747s. His mother also worked for Boeing. He doesn’t have to think back too far to remember 1971, when a global economic slowdown and skyrocketing oil prices prompted the company to lay off more than half its work force, sending Seattle into a tailspin.
Now, as the company grapples with a
pair of fatal crashes
involving its most popular airplane, the 737 Max, Mr. Russell points to Boeing’s record of resilience as proof that it will be able to overcome the latest troubles. Will its engineers be able to design a solution to the technical conundrum that threatens the company’s best-selling jet ever, which now
has been grounded worldwide
? “Sure,” Mr. Russell said, without missing a beat.
A total of 189 people died aboard a Lion Air flight that went down in Indonesia in October 2018, while a second fatal Max crash in Ethiopia last month claimed 157 lives. On Friday, as preliminary findings from the Ethiopia crash
cast further doubt
on Boeing’s instructions to pilots flying the new Max planes, the company announced that it would
reduce monthly production
of its 737 jets to 42 a month from 52.
[Read more about
Boeing’s decision to slow production of the 737
.]
It is hard to find a place in Seattle where people don’t have some personal or family connection to the giant aircraft manufacturer, the largest private employer in Washington state, and that means plenty of people worried about whether the back-to-back crashes will affect orders for a plane upon which the company has banked
much of its near-term future
.
The company is everywhere: Boeing Field, just south of downtown Seattle, is still used for testing and delivery of Boeing planes. Wide-body jets are assembled at the company’s giant factory in Everett, to the north. The 737s are put together at the 1.1 million-square-foot plant in Renton, 12 miles southeast of downtown Seattle. Renton is also home to the headquarters of Boeing’s commercial airplane group.
“One of my very best friends from first grade, both his parents worked for Boeing,” said Ed Prince, a City Council member in Renton. “Seattle, for so many years, was a company town — Boeing was it.”
Where downtown Seattle is booming with expensive high-rise condo towers, Renton, a suburb of slightly more than 100,000 people, still sports single-family homes in its small-townish core. The city’s population tripled during World War II, and “Boeing was a huge part of that,” said Elizabeth Stewart, executive director of the Renton History Museum.
The one-way roads that permeate downtown Renton are, said Ms. Stewart, a relic of World War II-era Boeing, which lobbied for the street grid so it could get workers in and out more quickly.
“They’ve been here for over 75 years; they’re iconic for our city,” said Renton’s mayor, Denis Law. “There was a period of time where there were very few people in the immediate region who either didn’t work for the Boeing Company or knew someone who did.”
These days, though, Boeing is no longer the only fish in the Cedar River, which flows beneath Renton’s downtown library.
The city has welcomed a number of new health care companies, as well as high-tech companies like Wizards of the Coast and industrial stalwarts like Paccar, the truck manufacturer. Across the street from Boeing’s Renton plant, on Lake Washington’s southern waterfront, is a new 712,000-square-foot office complex that city officials hope will attract new high-tech tenants.
Some of those one-way streets are being transformed into two-way streets.
Still, the question of what caused the crash of the two 737s and whether Boeing engineers bear any responsibility has been a near-constant topic of conversation — along with questions about a company that has changed significantly since many old-timers around town worked there. The company’s corporate headquarters moved to Chicago in 2001. Some aircraft parts are now manufactured as far away as Asia.
Since countries grounded the Max plane, and after Boeing paused deliveries of new jets, a backlog has been created on its production lines in Renton.
Boeing employees are not allowed to publicly discuss the crash investigations, so many of those outside must rely on snippets of information from friends, or news reports. Lately,
many of those reports have focused
on an automated system designed to prevent stalls that may have caused the pilots to lose control of the planes — though no definitive cause has been determined.
Greg Langmann, 60, who spent 35 years with the company as an engineer before retiring in 2017, said he came to believe that the culture at the company was in need of revamping.
“Decisions at Boeing are typically conducted in tribal fashion, rather than openly using reason and logic,” said Mr. Langmann, who worked in offices down the street from the Renton plant for much of his career. “Project management, a focus at Boeing, should be more than managing cost and schedule,” he said. “You should understand something of the project. Otherwise you can’t manage product performance, value or safety.”
On Friday, when it announced the slowdown of its production of the 737, the company also said it would establish a new committee on its board of directors to review how it develops and builds aircraft.
Dave Hayes is a recently retired Boeing pilot who moved to the Seattle area more than a decade ago from California, where he worked for Northwest Airlines. He was hunched over a pale ale one recent afternoon at Trencher’s, a sports bar in a large mixed-use complex called The Landing, which opened in 2007 on what used to be Boeing property in Renton.
Mr. Hayes is still in close contact with his ex-colleagues, who he says are concerned about the prospect of increased oversight by Congress and the Federal Aviation Administration in the wake of criticism that the F.A.A. allowed Boeing to do
much of its own safety analysis
.
“My personal opinion is Congress has never provided funding to the F.A.A. to give them in-depth knowledge of how some of the intricate systems of airplanes work,” said Mr. Hayes. “They’re not as involved on a daily basis as the pilots and engineers at Boeing are.”
On a recent afternoon at Liberty Park in Renton, several people had gathered for a high-school baseball game, and once again, talk turned to the crash inquiries and the increasing signs that Boeing’s design could have played a role.
“They will bounce back. They’re No. 1. They just let a money issue cloud their mind,” said Mario Terrell, a wellness nurse who comes from a family that includes several current and former Boeing workers — including his mother. He said he fears the company cut corners to save money. “My mom’s very upset,” he said.
That she is. Jacquelyn Terrell, now 86, was a longtime shop steward at Boeing’s Renton plant and is still in touch with many of her former co-workers and the union.
“Everyone is shocked,” she said. “That’s not Boeing. Something’s wrong. They need to dig further. There’s a lack of pilot training.”
Having seen many of the troubles the company has faced in past years, most people here seem to expect that whatever the current problem, Boeing’s designers will, as they always have, engineer a way out of it.
Mr. Russell, who used to build truck cabs for a Paccar subsidiary in Renton and Seattle, recalled “the battery fiasco” in 2013, when it was discovered that the batteries in Boeing’s just-rolled-out 787 Dreamliner were prone to overheating; it led to a three-month grounding of the plane. Boeing, he noted, swiftly developed a fix and got the fleet back on track.
“It was a big deal,” Mr. Russell said. “But they made a bigger deal out of it than it was.”

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — SpaceX launched its second supersized rocket and for the first time landed all three boosters Thursday, a year after sending up a sports car on the initial test flight.
The new and improved Falcon Heavy thundered into the early evening sky with a communication satellite called Arabsat, the rocket's first paying customer. The Falcon Heavy is the most powerful rocket in use today, with 27 engines firing at liftoff — nine per booster.
Eight minutes after liftoff, SpaceX landed two of the first-stage boosters back at Cape Canaveral, side by side, just like it did for the rocket's debut last year. The core booster landed two minutes later on an ocean platform hundreds of miles offshore. That's the only part of the first mission that missed.
""What an amazing day,"" a SpaceX flight commentator exclaimed. ""Three for three boosters today on Falcon Heavy, what an amazing accomplishment.""
The Falcon Heavy soared from NASA's Kennedy Space Center, using the same pad that shot Apollo astronauts to the moon a half-century ago and later space shuttle crews.
Nearby beaches and other prime viewing spots were packed with tourists and locals eager to catch not just the launch but the rare and dramatic return of twin boosters, accompanied by sonic booms. The roads were also jammed for Wednesday night's launch attempt, which was scuttled by high wind.
Because this was an upgraded version of the rocket with unproven changes, SpaceX chief Elon Musk cautioned in advance things might go wrong. But everything went exceedingly well and the satellite ended up in the proper orbit. SpaceX employees at company headquarters in Southern California cheered every launch milestone and especially the three touchdowns.
""The Falcons have landed,"" Musk said in a tweet that included pictures of all three boosters.
NASA offered swift congratulations. ""From our iconic launch pads at @NASAKennedy, we will continue to support the growing commercial space economy,"" NASA tweeted. Musk replied with three red hearts.
Musk put his own Tesla convertible on last year's demo. The red Roadster — with a mannequin, dubbed Starman, likely still at the wheel — remains in a solar orbit stretching just past Mars.
The Roadster is thought to be on the other side of the sun from us right now, about three-quarters of the way around its first solar orbit, said Jon Giorgini, a senior analyst at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.
A couple dozen ground telescopes kept tabs on the car during its first several days in space, but it gradually faded from view as it headed out toward the orbit of Mars, Giorgini noted.
The Roadster could still look much the same as it did for the Feb. 6, 2018, launch, just not as shiny with perhaps some chips and flakes from the extreme temperature swings, according to Giorgini. It will take decades if not centuries for solar radiation to cause it to decompose, he said.
SpaceX plans to launch its next Falcon Heavy later this year on a mission for the U.S. Air Force. The boosters for that flight may be recycled from this one.
NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine last month suggested possibly using a Falcon Heavy — and another company's big rocket — to get the space agency's Orion capsule around the moon, minus a crew, in 2020. But the preferred method remains NASA's own Space Launch System mega rocket — if it can be ready by then.
Bridenstine said everything is on the space table as NASA strives to meet the White House's goal of landing astronauts back on the moon by 2024.
NASA's Saturn V rockets, used for the Apollo moon shots, are the all-time launch leaders so far in size and might.
SpaceX typically launches Falcon 9 rockets. The Falcon Heavy is essentially three of those single rockets strapped together.
Until SpaceX came along, boosters were discarded in the ocean after satellite launches. The company is intent on driving down launch costs by recycling rocket parts.

On the day after February’s trade deadline stripped the Rangers of three key veterans, David Quinn’s whistle pierced the practice rink air. The coach barked with the rasp of a well-worn instructor’s voice, “That can’t happen.” The Rangers reran the drill, which Quinn this time punctuated with “good job.”
An hour into the session, Quinn skated in to speak quietly with Brendan Lemieux during a defensive routine. Lemieux, the 23-year-old prospect acquired in a trade for Kevin Hayes, had met Quinn only that morning after joining from the Winnipeg Jets.
“That’s what was really cool about my first practice,” Lemieux said afterward. “I was already learning things, being taught. I guess that goes to what kind of coach he is. He’s a teacher. There are a lot of N.H.L. coaches that aren’t like that.”
With the Rangers more than a year into a rebuild, teaching a young team has been Quinn’s primary objective. Ten players on the Rangers’ roster are 23 or younger. Entering the final game of the season, the Rangers have just four wins in 19 games since the trade deadline on Feb. 25, though seven losses were by a single goal, including five in overtime or a shootout.
“We were close, but that doesn’t cut it in this league,” Quinn said.
He
arrived in New York last Ma
y after five years as the head coach at Boston University and more than two decades leading or assisting predominantly A.H.L., college and national team development programs. Quinn’s own promising playing career came to an abrupt end in college with the diagnosis of hemophilia and a life-threatening injury.
“When you look at what he’s gone through as a coach in order to reach the pinnacle of the game, not a lot of people would go through what Quinny has gone through,” said Penguins Coach Mike Sullivan, a former teammate at B.U. “I think that’s a reflection of his love of the sport but also his competitive nature.”
General Manager Jeff Gorton called Quinn’s track record with young players a huge part of his appeal. That recent history included work with four first-round picks while leading B.U., a group headlined by the Buffalo Sabres star Jack Eichel. Quinn, 52, had taken over for the longtime coach Jack Parker — for whom Quinn played in the 1980s — and he expected to spend his career there even as three N.H.L. teams called to gauge his interest.
But, Quinn said, “It’s the New York Rangers.”
“I really don’t think I ever would have left B.U. for any other situation, or people, or organization than this,” he added. “Everything aligned. Every single thing.”
Quinn has so often preached his desire that the Rangers play “fast, physical, and relentless” hockey that some players refer to the phrase as “our team slogan.” His first season was notable for its hard practices, blunt postgame assessments and healthy scratches. Quinn’s players, past and present, consistently mention his honest and direct style of giving feedback.
“He’s very good at communicating, but he’s so smart about the way he does it, too,” Eichel said.
Sabres forward Evan Rodrigues, who played his junior and senior seasons at B.U. under Quinn, had a goal and an assist in his first game for Quinn in October 2013. Afterward, Quinn asked the player for a self-evaluation. Rodrigues said, “Probably like a B, B+.” Quinn replied, “Well, I give you a C-.”
In hindsight, Rodrigues realized his coach was right.
“I don’t doubt much that he says,” Rodrigues said, before adding: “I’m very, very thankful for him because I don’t think I’d be where I am today if it weren’t for him.”
Quinn attributed that plain-spoken manner partly to his father — “an old-school Irish cop” — and to his sudden diagnosis as a college sophomore with hemophilia B, also known as Christmas disease.
“Life experiences form all of us,” he said. “I think that is probably why I’m so direct with people because of what I’ve been through personally. I really believe those experiences — because I really struggled for two years after that. Then I got back on my feet and went, ‘All right, hey, look how lucky I am, really.’”
After Quinn dealt with persistent bruising throughout the 1985-86 season, B.U.’s team physician suggested he get blood work after the playoffs. The tests showed hemophilia.
“I’m 20 years old and I think I’m going to play in the N.H.L. and I think I’m going to play for the ’88 Olympic team,” Quinn said. “You’re talking about a big kick in the teeth, you know? I’m trying to scramble. What am I going to do with my life? I had my next 15 years mapped out. I was a first-round pick, I’m going to play in the N.H.L. And I went through some tough times, but I always thought to myself, ‘The people who really have affected me in my life other than my parents are my coaches.’”
Quinn continued playing for B.U., but, after an injury-plagued junior season, he badly sprained his right ankle playing pickup basketball. The bruising turned into compartment syndrome, which required surgery. In his Rangers office recently, he rolled down a red-and-blue striped sock to expose a scar running down the outer half of his calf muscle to his ankle.
He was in the hospital for five weeks and said he almost bled to death. His collegiate hockey career was over. Quinn remained at B.U. to finish his sociology degree and helped coach the school’s junior varsity hockey team.
In 1991, the F.D.A. approved a drug trial to help hemophiliacs clot more quickly. By injecting himself before every practice and game, Quinn returned to the ice in what he refers to only as a “pseudo-comeback.” He had not skated in four years and had lost some mobility in his right foot.
Quinn signed with the Rangers in 1992 and played a year and a half of minor league hockey. He had been a lock for the 1988 Olympic team but was a late cut from the ’92 squad. He tried out one final time for the 1994 roster, but was cut early.
The night he was cut, Quinn was in his family’s home in Cranston, R.I., when his former B.U. assistant coach Ben Smith called. Smith had taken over as Northeastern head coach and offered Quinn an assistant job. He drove to Boston the next day.
Quinn spent two nomadic decades in the coaching ranks. He was associate coach of B.U.’s 2009 N.C.A.A. championship team and was head coach of the 2015 squad that lost in the national title game. He was known for his recruiting panache.
“I remember my mom couldn’t stop talking about him,” said Rangers defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk, who was recruited to B.U. by Quinn. “He put the charm on my mom. I think, more than anything, he just had this presence to him.”
Now, Quinn is charged with coaxing the most out of the Rangers’ young talent.
“They’re a structured team,” said Florida Panthers associate coach Jack Capuano, a lifelong friend of Quinn’s. “They work hard. Obviously they’re buying into what he’s selling.”
Quinn said the Rangers had “some good pieces here to build around,” citing the advances the Islanders and the Canadiens have made since last season.
A talented new piece of the puzzle is likely on its way. The Rangers will participate in the N.H.L. draft lottery on Tuesday.
Quinn, who lamented the lack of practice time in the N.H.L., called the challenge of rebuilding through development “very appealing.”
“You really get a chance as the coach to be very involved in the process of the next great team here, hopefully,” he said.
An earlier version of this article misstated the number of overtime losses the Rangers had since the trade deadline on Feb. 25. It was five, not four.

Pittsburgh Steelers guard Ramon Foster is asking his ex-teammates to stop the criticism of current Steelers players.
The Steelers went through a tumultuous 2018 season with the holdout of running back Le'Veon Bell and growing tensions between quarterback Ben Roethlisberger and All-Pro wideout Antonio Brown.
And even with Bell and Brown gone from Pittsburgh, dissension has continued, with Brown and other former players sharing their criticism of the team on social media. Roethlisberger and wideout Juju Smith-Schuster have been among the targets.
The latest social-media salvo was fired early Thursday morning by former Steelers running back Rashard Mendenhall, who called Roethlisberger a racist in a series of tweets. Mendenhall, who played for Pittsburgh from 2008-12, was addressing accusations that Brown quit on the team when he did not play in the season finale.
""Alright, I'll end the mystery ... B's racist and @AB84's black. He had to catch balls from a racist quarterback. Every honest player knows it, it's not a big deal. He was just supposed to take his lickings and move on, like a slave for real,"" Mendenhall tweeted.
Foster, apparently, has had enough.
""Moving forward...any former player or affiliate of the Steelers who has an issue with anyone still in the locker room, please contact me or Maurkice Pouncey or anyone else you feel you can talk to,"" Foster wrote on Twitter. ""Whoever you have an issue with, we will get you their number so you can address them. I PROMISE. These media takes might give y'all good traffic on your social media outlets but the guys still in that locker room, who y'all still know personally have to answer for those comments. Call them what you want, but call them personally and tell THEM. Defend who you want to defend but you don't have to mention the team at all.
""Whether you have a ring or played for one year...ENOUGH...CHILL. Most players at one point in their life want to take their kids back to the place where they once played, don't burn too many bridges.""
Foster and Pouncey are longtime Steelers, with a combined 18 seasons on the offensive line in Pittsburgh.

CONCORD, N.H. — A federal judge on Thursday gave the U.S. Justice Department two weeks to clarify its stance on laws regulating internet gambling after hearing arguments from New Hampshire officials in a case with potential implications for the future of state lotteries and the programs, often educational, that they fund.
Judge Paul Barbadoro issued the deadline for the department to determine the reach of the federal Wire Act and then another seven days for other parties to respond. After that, Barbadoro is expected to rule on the lawsuit filed by the New Hampshire Lottery Commission.
It is unclear whether the ruling would apply only to New Hampshire, as the department would like, or more broadly to all 47 states with government operated lotteries. Several of those, including Michigan and Pennsylvania, filed friend-of-the court briefs in this case.
""We have an obligation to protect the revenues for the state, fund education for schools in New Hampshire,"" Charlie McIntyre, the executive director of the New Hampshire Lottery, said after the hearing. ""That is a lot of money. ... Over the next biennium, you are talking $192 million. ... It's real money, so we have to protect it.""
The Wire Act was enacted in 1961 to target the mob and prohibits interstate wagering. In 2011, New York and Illinois asked the Justice Department whether selling lottery tickets over the internet violated the Wire Act. The department concluded that online gambling within states that does not involve sporting events would not violate federal law.
In November last year, though, the department issued an opinion interpreting the act as applying to any form of gambling that crosses state lines, not just sports betting. That raised concerns about the viability of online poker and other gambling across states, as well as state lotteries.
New Hampshire law requires that all net lottery profits go toward education funding. Since 1964, that has amounted to more than $2 billion.
Only a small portion of the $90 million the state gets annually from the lottery comes from its iLottery, which brings in $4 million to $6 million in the fiscal year that starts in July. The broadest interpretation of the opinion would prohibit all lottery-related activities that use the internet, including popular games like Powerball. If so, that would jeopardize $80 billion in revenue.
On Monday, the Justice Department filed a memo saying that its opinion didn't address state lotteries and that it was in the process of determining whether the Wire Act applied. It requested more time to consider the reach of the act and said federal prosecutors had been advised not to enforce the November opinion until a decision was made.
The request for additional time didn't sit well with the New Hampshire Lottery Commission, which sued the department in February.
The state argued the prosecutions would still be possible and argued further delays could complicate the state's budget process, since a key source of revenue comes from lottery revenues. It also argued Monday's memo demonstrated how the department failed to consider the impact of its opinion and didn't understand how modern lotteries do business.
It wants the court to vacate the 2018 opinion and rule that the Wire Act does not apply to state-run lotteries.
Meanwhile, vendors who help run the online lotteries argued the 2018 opinion served to harm their efforts to raise capital and expand their gaming businesses.
""Today, we are at risk of being disconnected from the internet,"" Matthew McGill, a lawyer representing Neopollard Interactive, which operates the state's online lottery, told the court. ""We are under all kinds of threats that arise from the 2018 memo. ... We need this declaratory judgment now. It's critical to our business.""
On the other side, supporters of the department's opinion include the Coalition to Stop Internet Gambling, which is backed by GOP megadonor Sheldon Adelson, a staunch opponent of internet gambling.
It joined with the National Association of Convenience Stores in arguing in a brief submitted in this case that the two have a ""strong interest"" in ensuring the Wire Act is applied properly because of the ""devastating effect"" that online gambling has on ""vulnerable individuals.""
But in its own brief, the state of New Jersey suggested Adelson, trying to limit the competition to his brick-and-mortar operations, was instrumental in pushing the department to issue its 2018 opinion.
McIntyre echoed those concerns, suggesting that Adelson had turned to the department for help after failing to convince Congress to amend the Wire Act.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — Harvard is investigating its longtime fencing coach after learning that he sold his house for a vastly inflated price to the father of a current student, shortly before the student was admitted.
The inquiry into the coach, Peter Brand, comes as universities around the country are scrambling to respond to a sweeping investigation of college admissions fraud, which has raised questions about athletic recruitment and whether coaches have enriched themselves by essentially selling recruiting slots.
The United States attorney’s office in Boston has charged 50 people in the case, including eight coaches and 33 parents,
among them Hollywood celebrities
and prominent business people.
Harvard has so far not been tied to the scandal in court documents. A university official said in an email to students and faculty members on Thursday that she did not believe the circumstances surrounding Mr. Brand, first
reported by The Boston Globe
, were connected to that case.
In 2016, Mr. Brand sold his house in Needham, a suburb of Boston, to Jie Zhao, whom The Globe described as a wealthy Maryland businessman. At the time, Mr. Zhao’s older son was a student at Harvard and on the fencing team, and his younger son was still in high school. Mr. Zhao paid $989,500, some $400,000 more than the assessed value at the time, which was $549,300.
“Place is vintage 1960s in bad shape,” the town’s assessor wrote when he inspected the house after the sale. “Makes no sense.”
At around the same time, Mr. Brand and his wife, Jacqueline Phillips, bought a condominium in Cambridge for $1.3 million, well above the $989,000 asking price.
Soon after, Mr. Zhao’s younger son, Edward, was admitted to Harvard, where he is currently a sophomore and at least until recently was on the fencing team, according to a profile that was recently deleted from the website for Harvard’s sports teams. He is no longer listed as a member of the team.
Mr. Zhao sold the house in Needham in October 2017, for $665,000, a significant loss.
Mr. Brand, Mr. Zhao, and Mr. Zhao’s sons did not respond to messages.
A spokeswoman for Harvard, Rachael Dane, said that the university was unaware of the circumstances surrounding the sale until asked about it by The Globe, and that it was now conducting an independent review.
“We are committed to ensuring the integrity of our recruitment practices,” she said.
Ms. Dane would not confirm whether Mr. Zhao’s younger son was in fact recruited by Mr. Brand, although the brothers were referred to as student-athletes in the email sent to students and faculty members on Thursday.
In the email, Claudine Gay, the dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, wrote that Harvard’s athletic recruitment practices were different from those of some other schools. The applications of student recruits are reviewed by the full admissions committee, which has roughly 40 members, and admissions decisions are made by a vote of the whole committee. Also, she said, all recruited athletes had to be interviewed by an admissions officer or alumni interviewer.
At this stage of the investigation into Mr. Brand, she said, there was a lot the university did not know yet.
“Regardless of what we eventually learn about these allegations, this is not a time for complacency,” she wrote. “Where there are opportunities to clarify practices and strengthen procedures, we must act on them, and do so with a sense of urgency.”
The university’s admissions practices have been under scrutiny for months. A lawsuit charging Harvard with discriminating against Asian-American applicants went to trial in October. In the process of defending itself, Harvard was forced to reveal many admissions secrets, including the advantages given to students whose parents went to Harvard, relatives of donors and recruited athletes. Documents showed that in recent years the admission rate of recruited athletes was 86 percent. A judge has not yet ruled in the lawsuit.
The Globe also reported on another set of peculiar transactions involving Mr. Brand, Mr. Zhao, and a nonprofit organization called the National Fencing Foundation of Washington D.C.
In 2013, Mr. Zhao made a $1 million gift to the fencing foundation, according to Timothy Miller, who was the organization’s treasurer at the time. The next year — the same year that Mr. Zhao’s older son, Eric, enrolled at Harvard — the fencing foundation made a $100,000 grant to a private foundation set up by Mr. Brand and his wife, tax documents show. The grant was one of only two that Mr. Brand’s foundation received before it dissolved two years later.
The fencing foundation’s president, Alexandre Ryjik, did not respond to messages.

LONDON — The
Saatchi Gallery
, Britain’s best-known and most popular private museum of cutting-edge contemporary art, is now operating as a nonprofit after a downturn in business and a decline in visitor numbers.
Since 1985, the gallery has been a platform for Britain’s most prominent and influential art collector, Charles Saatchi, to exhibit and promote works from his own collection. It was run as a commercial enterprise until last month. But Mr. Saatchi now appears to be relinquishing control of the institution, which has recently changed tack to display more art from outside his own holdings.
Last month, a new enterprise, also called the Saatchi Gallery, was
registered as a charitable incorporated organization
with the British government’s Charity Commission. Johan Eliasch, 57, a London-based Swedish billionaire who in the late 1990s turned around the fortunes of the ailing sports group Head N.V., was named as the lead trustee. Mr. Eliasch is a friend of Mr. Saatchi’s and a prominent environmental campaigner. He declined to comment.
Introduced by the British government in 2013, charitable incorporated organizations are meant to combine the benefits of being a nonprofit with those of being a company. The status gives a variety of tax reliefs and trustees “have
limited or no liability
for a charitable company’s debts,” according to the government’s website.
In recent years, the gallery’s finances have been controlled by one of Mr. Saatchi’s private companies.
Philippa Adams, the gallery’s director, said in an email that its operations “are continuing as before under the recently formed charity structure.” She added that the new charity was “debt free” and that all the gallery’s staff members had been transferred to it.
Mr. Saatchi, 75, is a former British advertising mogul who became one of the contemporary art world’s most influential and astute collectors and dealers. A 1997 exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts in London, “Sensation: Young British Artists From the Saatchi Collection,” showcased a provocative new spirit in British art. Signature acquisitions, such as Damien Hirst’s 1991
shark-in-formaldehyde sculpture
, “The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living,” and Tracey Emin’s 1998 installation,
“My Bed,”
were later sold for millions.
The Saatchi Gallery, which for the past 10 years has leased the stately Duke of York’s Headquarters building in the Chelsea district of London, has concentrated on showing new works by emerging artists from Mr. Saatchi’s collection “to the widest audience possible,” according to the gallery’s website. Free admission to the gallery’s own shows encouraged high attendance figures. Just over 1.8 million visited the museum in 2017, but last year that figure declined by a third to 1.2 million, according to annual reports of museum attendances published by
The Art Newspaper
.
Guest exhibitions with ticket sales and renting out the venue for events have become the gallery’s main sources of revenue. Some critics have said that commercial exhibitions, such as a two-day pop-up
“
immersive experience
” in 2017 to celebrate 10 years of the reality TV show “Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” or the coming
“Tutankhamun: Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh”
blockbuster, a global touring show produced by the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities and the
IMG Group
(where Mr. Eliasch has been a director), have blunted the gallery’s cutting-edge brand.
“The astonishment of the early Saatchi has now been normalized,” said Stephen Bayley, a cultural commentator and former director of the privately owned Design Museum in London. “The artists he showcased who caused outrage 30-plus years ago have become media-friendly house-trained pop celebrities,” he added. “And the Saatchi Gallery is on its way to becoming an event venue.”
Accounts
submitted to Companies House, Britain’s national business registry, by Marchill Investments, the entity Mr. Saatchi has used to run the gallery, show that in 2017 the company had a loss of £24,764, or about $32,600, compared with a profit of £1.2 million in 2016. Corporate sponsorship in 2017 was down 37 percent year-on-year to £2.2 million. Marchill Investments’ accounts for 2018 were overdue, according to the Companies House website.
Mr. Saatchi, who declined to comment for this article, announced in 2010 that he wished to
donate his collection
(then valued at $37 million) to the nation on his retirement. This proposed gift has never been formally accepted by the British government and Mr. Saatchi has yet to formally announce that he is stepping back from public life.

HONG KONG — Two-time champions Guangzhou Evergrande bounced back from their first defeat in this year's Asian Champions League with a 4-0 thrashing of Melbourne Victory at Tianhe Stadium on Wednesday.
Anderson Talisca scored twice in the opening 10 minutes as Guangzhou highlighted the gap in quality between themselves and the A League side before Yang Liyu struck three minutes before halftime.
The Chinese Super League (CSL) side's win was completed by Leigh Broxham's own goal 17 minutes from time.
The 2013 and 2015 continental champions now have six points from three games having lost their last game against tournament debutantes Daegu FC from South Korea last month.
Guangzhou are in a three-way tie in Group F with Daegu and Sanfrecce Hiroshima after the J-League leaders notched up a 2-0 home win over the Korean side thanks to goals from Douglas Vieira and Daiki Watari.
Melbourne prop up the standings having yet to claim a point as the group phase reaches the halfway point.
Sydney FC, meanwhile, were denied their first win of the campaign despite taking the lead three times against CSL champions Shanghai SIPG, who scored a late equaliser in a 3-3 draw.
""We're obviously disappointed to throw away the lead a couple of times in a game like this against top quality players, let's not kid ourselves,"" said Sydney striker Adam Le Fondre.
""But we gave a great account of ourselves and I think we can feel hard done by that we've not got the win.""
Ulsan Hyundai from South Korea lead Group H with seven points as Kim Su-an's stoppage time strike gave them victory over Japanese champions Kawasaki Frontale.
SIPG are second on four points, with Frontale a further point behind and Sydney bottom of the standings.
In the western half of the draw, Xavi Hernandez rolled back to years to score twice as Qatar's Al Sadd shared a 2-2 draw with Uzbekistan's Pakhtakor in their meeting in Tashkent.
The former Spain midfielder put his side in front with a curling effort six minutes into the game and restored their lead six minutes after Khodjiakbar Alidjanov had levelled with a free kick from distance.
Dragan Ceran, however, earned Pakhtakor a point four minutes before the interval to leave them a point clear at the top of Group D from Al Sadd, with Persepolis in third following their 2-0 win over Saudi Arabia's Al Ahli.
In Group B, Al Wahda from the United Arab Emirates moved into pole position with a 2-1 win over Qatar's Al Rayyan.
They were joined on six points by two-time champions Al Ittihad from Saudi Arabia, who won 3-2 against Lokomotiv Tashkent from Uzbekistan thanks to Fahad Al Muwallad's stoppage time penalty.

MINNEAPOLIS — It was an easy question to ask, even if the answer was tough to absorb.
""Why?""
It dogged Virginia for a year and three weeks — following the Cavaliers through sweat-soaked practices, hostile arenas up and down the East Coast, on talk radio and pundit-driven TV, and in their own, doubt-filled, uncertain minds.
The only truly satisfying answer to ""Why?"" came Monday night — and with the confetti falling and the nets dangling around their necks, it all seemed so clear.
That humbling, history-making loss last season to Maryland-Baltimore County happened so the Cavaliers could stand at center court and celebrate this time around.
The only top seed to fall to a No. 16 in the history of the NCAA Tournament is now the only team to come back from such a loss and win a championship the very next season. Virginia did it the hard way, squandering a 10-point lead against a tenacious Texas Tech team, only to pull away for an 85-77 victory in overtime.
And now, there are no more questions.
""We've all had our own battles,"" said Virginia guard Kyle Guy, who was named the Final Four's most valuable player. ""I said earlier, it's a really special group because we all had the same 'Why?' among other 'whys.' But to share the same one, and to battle everything we battled through, and come out on top, it's a fantastic feeling.""
It's tempting to call Virginia a team of destiny, but that would undermine what the Cavaliers accomplished this season. It would give short shrift to the way they overcame so many close calls in this tournament, including an entertaining, back-and-forth final against an opponent that simply would not go away.
Lottery-pick-in-waiting De'Andre Hunter scored a career-high 27 points after starting the game 0 for 7 from the floor. Going mano-a-mano against another likely NBA-bound star, Jarrett Culver, Hunter saved the Cavaliers (35-3) with a game-tying 3 with 12 seconds left in regulation, then helped them win it with a go-ahead 3 with 2:07 left in the overtime.
Hunter's game-tying shot came on a play that Texas Tech doesn't usually allow: Ty Jerome dribbled into the middle, then skipped a pass down the baseline to Hunter, who spotted up from the corner. The nation's best defense hardly ever leaves someone that wide-open.
""With a 3-point lead ... we're trying to play really sound defense with three objectives: No 3-point shots, no 'and-ones,' and we've got to secure the defensive rebounds,"" Texas Tech coach Chris Beard said. ""We just came up a little bit short, but give Virginia credit. They have a really, really good team. So much poise, and just have a lot of respect for them.""
The poise showed up earlier in the tournament, too.
First, when the Cavaliers, a 1 seed again, fell behind by 14 early to No. 16 Gardner-Webb in what seemed like a repeat of the nightmare from the year before. They won 71-56.
Next, against Purdue, when, trailing by 2, the Cavaliers intentionally missed a free throw, got the ball back and fed to Mamadi Diakite, who beat the buzzer to send the game into overtime. They won 80-75.
And then in the semifinal Saturday against Auburn, when Guy got fouled while shooting a 3 with 0.6 seconds left, and calmly sank all three free throws. They won 63-62.
""I hope that it's a message for some people out there that there can be hope and joy and resiliency,"" said Virginia coach Tony Bennett, whose father Dick, the coach who wrote the book on stifling man-to-man defense, was in the crowd. ""I'm thankful for what happened.""
All Virginia fans are.
This is a program that has lived a tortured existence, starting around Christmastime in 1982, when 7-foot-4 Ralph Sampson — as good as they came back in his day — was headlining the top-ranked Cavaliers on a stopover trip in Hawaii, only to get shocked by tiny, NAIA Chaminade. It still goes down as one of the greatest upsets in sports.
Thirty years later, Bennett turned the Cavaliers into contenders again, but they always underachieved once the calendar turned to March.
Then, last year.
That loss to UMBC could've wrecked a lesser program.
Somehow, this one got stronger.
Has the pain gone completely away?
""You have a scar, and it reminds you of that, but it's a memory,"" Bennett said. ""Does it go away completely? No. I wish it wouldn't have happened in some ways. But now I say, 'Well, it bought us a ticket here. So be it.'""

LONDON — Vittorio Grigolo got his first major operatic break in June 2010, when the Royal Opera House cast him at the last minute in Massenet’s “Manon.” Critics and audiences were ecstatic.
Now, the Italian tenor — described by Anthony Tommasini in The New York Times as “
perhaps the most dependably exciting singer in opera
” — is getting ready to return to the Royal Opera stage in May as Cavaradossi in a revival of Puccini’s “Tosca.” It’s an opera he knows well. At 13, he played the shepherd boy in a 1990 Rome Opera production of it that starred Luciano Pavarotti. By then, young Vittorio already had a few years of singing under his belt, having been a soloist in the Sistine Chapel Choir.
Mr. Grigolo, 42, has tried other genres, too. In his 20s, he briefly gave up opera for “popera,” recording a CD, “In the Hands of Love,” that reached No. 6 on the British pop album charts.
The tenor is known in opera circles for throwing himself into his roles. He’s also a daredevil offstage, with a passion for sports cars and motorcycles. The following conversation, translated from Italian, has been edited and condensed.
How old were you when you realized you wanted to be a singer?
I was 4 or 5. I heard my uncle sing “O Sole Mio” in a holiday village in Puglia and was stunned by the powerful, booming sound coming out of his chest. My heart was pounding. I said to my mother: “Uncle has supernatural powers. It’s as if he was a superhero. I want to be a superhero like him.”
Soon afterward, I started singing with my dad, who sang opera arias at home, in the bathroom or in the car.
What was it like being in the Sistine Chapel Choir as a little boy?
It was an incredible gift to train in such beautiful surroundings, with statues everywhere and beautiful ceilings. It was particularly special to sing in private concerts, private Masses attended by the pope, moments of special prayer. It was like being a singer in a painting. I was conscious of the grandeur of the place.
How important was Mr. Pavarotti in your life and career?
For a little boy like me, hearing him sing live and singing with him was incredibly moving. He would always give me advice and encouragement. He would say: “Vittorio, I can teach you all the tenor parts you like, but I can’t teach you charisma. You have it — that extra ingredient in the magic potion that will allow you to touch people.”
A decade or two ago, singers such as the Three Tenors — Mr. Pavarotti, Plácido Domingo and José Carreras — were household names. Why are there
no opera celebrities on that scale today?
Opera doesn’t have the same platform that it used to have. In the past, radio and television broadcast it a lot more.
I’m convinced that things are changing now, with opera broadcasts in movie theaters. They give people an introduction to opera. The tickets are cheaper, it’s easier, and if people like what they see, they can buy a ticket to experience opera itself.
It’s also important for singers to perform outside of opera houses. I was one of the first to sing
“La Traviata” in a train station in Zurich
, and “L’Elisir d’Amore” at Malpensa Airport in Milan. These might seem like crazy projects, but they make people realize that opera and classical music are part of our history, and that they have to be part of our life.
Why did you give up your crossover career?
I realized that it wasn’t going to be my future, because I would’ve ended up being forgotten by the opera world. So I had to go back into opera.
Now that I’ve sung in all the major opera houses and been recognized all over the world, I can allow myself to step out and communicate again in a more popular musical language, meaning with a pop song rather than an opera aria.
You won’t abandon opera?
Of course not! How can I abandon opera at the age of 40? I only just got where I am, and I have another 20 years of opera in me. I’ll certainly be singing until I’m at least 60 or 70.
You have to preserve the voice. There are opera singers who sing for three years and are finished. So you have to know how to choose the right repertoire. Otherwise, it’s not you who will be deciding to abandon opera, it’s opera that might abandon you.
Explain your passion for fast cars and motorcycles.
I’ve been motorcycle racing since I was a boy. To me, the sound of the motorcycle engine is like an orchestra. I love to hear it when I’m wearing my motorcycle helmet: That rumbling noise that makes me quiver and gives me as much emotion as a great voice singing at the top of their lungs.
You have a taste for risk and danger?
I like to push things to the limit. As far as dying goes, you can die walking out the front door, slipping on a banana peel.

BURBANK, Calif. — Walt Disney Co priced its highly anticipated streaming video service below Netflix in an aggressive move to challenge the dominant streaming service and entice families to buy yet another monthly subscription.
Disney said on Thursday its new family-friendly streaming service will cost $7 monthly or $70 annually with a slate of new and classic TV shows and movies from some of the world's most popular entertainment franchises in a bid to challenge the digital dominance of Netflix.
The ad-free monthly subscription called Disney+ is set to launch on Nov. 12 and in every major global market over time, the company said. In addition to Disney films and TV shows, it will feature programming from the Marvel superhero universe, the ""Star Wars"" galaxy, ""Toy Story"" creator Pixar animation the National Geographic channel and the entire library of ""The Simpsons.""
""What we are putting forward is an aggressive strategy,"" Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger told analysts at the presentation. ""We've got to be very serious and all in on it.""
The company set a target of luring between 60 million to 90 million subscribers and achieving profitability in fiscal year 2024. It plans to plow a little over $1 billion in cash to finance original programming in fiscal 2020 and about $2 billion by 2024.
The cost of the service was lower than the $7.50 per month that Wall Street analysts expected on average, according to a Reuters poll, and could likely be seen as a stronger bid to appeal to more customers.
Patrice Cucinello, a director at Fitch Ratings, said Disney had priced the new service ""very affordably.""
""Disney is approaching streaming offerings, particularly Disney+, with guns blazing, looking to take share and quickly ramp subscriber growth,"" Cucinello said.
To get it in front of more people, Disney said it has struck deals with Roku Inc and Sony Corp to distribute Disney+ on streaming devices and console gaming systems and expects it to be widely available on smart televisions, tablets, and other outlets by launch. It did not mention if it would be available on Apple Inc's upcoming video service.
Disney kicked off its presentation to Wall Street analysts at its Burbank, California, headquarters on Thursday with a video that demonstrated the breadth of its portfolio, showing clips from dozens of classic TV shows and movies from ""Frozen"" and ""The Lion King"" to ""Avatar"" and ""The Sound of Music.""
The transformation of the Mouse House, as it is known, from a cable television powerhouse into a leader of streaming media could be Iger's final legacy as he told Wall Street analysts he would not extend his contract beyond 2021 and was working with the board of directors on a succession plan.
GLOBAL GROWTH
Executives said they see opportunities to take its ESPN+ sport streaming video service to Latin America and are looking into international expansion of its Hulu streaming video business, which offers movies and shows targeted to adults.
Disney also forecast Hulu's subscribers to reach 40 million to 60 million by fiscal 2024 and reach profitability in the United States by either 2023 or 2024. Hulu currently has 25 million subscribers and is expected to lose $1.5 billion in the current fiscal year.
The digital push is Disney's response to cord-cutting, the dropping of cable service that has hit its ESPN sports network and other channels, and the rise of Netflix Inc. The Silicon Valley upstart has amassed 139 million customers worldwide since it began streaming 12 years ago.
Disney will join the market at a time when audiences are facing a host of choices, and monthly bills, for digital entertainment. Apple, AT&T Inc's WarnerMedia and others plan new streaming services.
To bolster its potential digital portfolio, Disney recently purchased film and TV assets from Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox and gained prized properties such as ""Avatar.""
Disney had been supplying new movies such as ""Black Panther"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"" to Netflix after their runs in theaters but ended that arrangement this year to feed its own streaming ambitions. The company estimated it is foregoing $150 million in licensing revenue this fiscal year by saving programming for its own platforms.
The Disney+ programming will draw in part from Disney's deep library of classic family films. It also will include exclusive original content such as a live-action ""Star Wars"" series called ""The Mandalorian,"" a show focused on Marvel movie villain Loki, and animated ""Monsters at Work,"" inspired by hit Pixar movie ""Monsters Inc.""
Some new Disney movies, such as a ""Lady and the Tramp"" remake, will go directly to the Disney+ app. Other new releases will appear on Disney+ after their run in theaters and after they cycle out of the home video sales window, executives have said.

Over the last few weeks, “Old Town Road” — a strutting and lightheartedly comedic country-rap tune by the previously unknown 20-year-old rapper
Lil Nas X
— has lived an improbable number of lives.
It began as a Hail Mary pass by a college dropout hoping music might save him from having to go back to school. But in the way that the internet can rapidly make and remake something, morphing meaning in real time, Lil Nas X’s track became something different almost every few days on its path from SoundCloud obscurity to pop ubiquity: a savvy troll, a manipulator of streaming algorithms, a
meme theme
, a battering ram to genre barriers, a trigger of music-biz discord, a David suffering at the hands of Goliath, a sociocultural rallying point, and eventually, a site of cross-cultural kumbaya.
And now, it’s likely to be one of the most emblematic songs of the year: On April 8, “Old Town Road”
became the No. 1 song in the country
, capping a startling ascent that demonstrates what can happen when viral engineering meets lightning-rod controversy meets the pop uncanny.
For its first 25 seconds, “Old Town Road” could be any other rural lament, a lonely howl delivered over a plucked ukulele. It’s only when the trap drums kick in and the vocals change from singing to quasi-ironic rapping that the song’s true intentions come to the fore. It’s a genre-hybrid exercise — a hip-hop song with country-themed subject matter, partly rapped and partly sung in an exaggerated honky-tonk accent — and also a comedy sketch. The way Lil Nas X overaccentuates his vowels and makes them wobble is a caricature of stoic drawl, and when he raps “cowboy hat from Gucci, Wrangler on my booty,” it’s both confident boast and funny fantasy.
It’s also a neat distillation of how genre is currently lived in American pop music: fluidly, with styles and ideas up for grabs by creators and easily slipped on and off by listeners, with varying degrees of sincerity. Pop, more than ever, is an identity playground.
[Never miss a pop music story:

.]
But the particular alchemy of “Old Town Road” also taps something deeper: more than two decades
of dialogue between country music and hip-hop
, genres that have been slowly but consistently finding common heritage, swapping structural elements and taking comfort in each other’s sounds.
But the industry’s gatekeepers are less interested in this mutability. For decades, Nashville has essentially framed and marketed the rural experience as white — despite and in defiance of the deep black roots of country music. So when an artist like Lil Nas X — who is black, and raps, and is from Atlanta, with no ties to the country music business — lays claim to rural aesthetics, even in a way that’s partly tongue in cheek, it causes real disruption. In late March, “Old Town Road” appeared on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart before it was
removed for being deemed insufficiently country
, causing a furor. But resistance led to embrace:
a remix of the song featuring Billy Ray Cyrus
, which in turn has been played by some country radio stations, which helped the song land on Billboard’s Country Airplay chart.
“Old Town Road” — the original or the remix — is by no means the first country-rap crossover. There have been collaborations across genre lines, like Nelly and Tim McGraw’s
“Over and Over”
; songs in which country singers rap, like Jason Aldean’s
“Dirt Road Anthem”
and Blake Shelton’s
“Boys ’Round Here”
; and performances that are fully genre flexible, like Sam Hunt’s “Take Your Time.”
And hip-hop has flirted with country signifiers on and off since the 1980s, whether it was the fringe-outfitted rapper Cowboy from the Furious Five, or Kool Moe Dee’s — and later,
Will Smith’s
— excursion to the “Wild Wild West.”
By the 1990s, Southern rap was flourishing, providing a platform for ideas, accents and sounds that weren’t part of hip-hop from the coasts. Crooked Lettaz from Mississippi, 8Ball & MJG from Tennessee,
UGK from Texas
and many more emphasized drawling flows and production that leaned toward Southern soul and sometimes blues.
Around the turn of the century, a pair of young white rappers, Bubba Sparxxx and Colt Ford, were beginning to work with Shannon Houchins, a producer in the Atlanta rap innovator Jermaine Dupri’s camp. Houchins would go on to produce most of “Dark Days, Bright Nights,” Sparxxx’s independent debut album, which got him signed to the major label Interscope and partnered with the producer Timbaland, who steered country-rap to its first big breakthrough moment: Sparxxx’s single “Ugly,” a hip-hop and pop hit with a video that included a pig sty and a tractor race, and went to No. 15 on the Billboard Hot 100. Sparxxx’s follow-up album, “Deliverance,” was a stunning and elegant cross-genre statement radically unlike anything that had preceded it. It made less of a broad impact, but in the wake of Sparxxx’s innovations came a wave of artists who effectively identified as country rappers focused on rural storytelling and signifiers — growing up far from cities, partying at mud bogs and so on.
The seeds were also planted for what was to be Nashville’s first extended flirtation with hip-hop. Kid Rock, an early white rapper, remade himself as a country-rock rapper-singer. Tim McGraw partnered with Nelly on “Over and Over,” a road ballad that went to No. 3 on the Hot 100 in 2004. Kenny Rogers collaborated with both Wyclef Jean and Coolio. Even Willie Nelson appeared on a hip-hop song. And in Nashville, the MuzikMafia emerged, a polyglot group of performers that included the singing duo Big & Rich and the rapper Cowboy Troy, who collaborated on several songs, including the single
“I Play Chicken With the Train,”
which in 2005 became the first country-rap song to land on the Billboard Country Songs chart.
These were outliers, or novelties — brief successes that Nashville tolerated but didn’t wholeheartedly embrace. But at around the same time, Houchins teamed up with Ford to form Average Joes Entertainment, a record label devoted to the intersection of country and rap centered on white rural experiences, with a growing stable of burly gool-ol’-boy rappers —
“hick-hop,” it was occasionally called
— operating largely outside the country music mainstream, though Ford regularly collaborated with the genre’s stars.
By the early 2010s, Nashville was in search of raw energy. The music became more rural, rougher at the edges and more willing to flaunt a range of influences. These younger singers — Jason Aldean, Luke Bryan — often made it plain that hip-hop was as much of their musical heritage as country or Southern rock.
That lineage was cemented when, in 2010, Aldean covered “Dirt Road Anthem,” a song originally recorded by Ford and Brantley Gilbert; his version went to No 1. on the country chart and No. 7 on the Hot 100. It opened the floodgates — Blake Shelton rapped a little, Bryan danced to hip-hop songs onstage, the duo Florida Georgia Line built a career on importing just the faintest hint of hip-hop percussion and slang. Their song “Cruise” became one of the biggest hits of 2013, bolstered by a remix featuring, who else, Nelly.
That there’s a splash of hip-hop coursing through country (its male performers, at least) is now fundamentally accepted, but always with the country performer — and the country music business — in control of just how much.
Nothing, though, is immune from the force and urgency of the meme economy, and Lil Nas X has demonstrated himself to be a master of how to pachinko his way from the margins to the mainstream. “Old Town Road” began on SoundCloud, where he tagged it as country to avoid competing with the hip-hop heavyweights that dominate the platform. Once it began to get noticed, he pushed it heavily on
TikTok, the short-performance-clip app
, where it was the soundtrack to thousands of videos.
The track also arrived at a fortuitous moment — on the heels of a trickle of Western aesthetics into the high-style universe over the last couple of years, and also following the success of stylistically
diverse country performers like Kacey Musgraves
, who have demonstrated that a country musician can be a beacon of cool far outside the genre’s walls. Even Kanye West recently took to the countryside,
unveiling his last album at a Wyoming cowboy ranch
.
In another moment, the aesthetic choices of “Old Town Road” might have been perceived as pure kitsch, but now they are kitsch with a side of tastemaker. And though the removal of the song from the country chart reflected an initial resentment, the mood soon switched. Some country singers said they found “Old Town Road” to be country, or country enough.
They didn’t want to be on the wrong side of cool
.
Billy Ray Cyrus, who joined the song’s remix, is not a country insider at the peak of his powers, but he’s still a performer with a great deal of resonance within Nashville thanks to his 1992 pop-country crossover smash
“Achy Breaky Heart.”
Cyrus’s “Old Town Road” verse is pure glitz, a blend of hip-hop braggadocio and country-boy-in-the-big-city awe: “Spent a lot of money on my brand-new guitar/Baby’s got a habit, diamond rings and Fendi sports bras/Ridin’ down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car.” The performance is effortless, showing a version of country music that’s cosmopolitan, flexible and self-aware.
Whether Cyrus’s co-sign will be enough for the industry side of Nashville to embrace “Old Town Road” remains to be seen. That’s because, when it comes to charts and common practices, country isn’t a genre or a set of sounds as much as it is an oligarchy, the product of a limited number of record labels; a media environment that relies heavily on radio (with programmers who can lack imagination,
as female country performers have long known
); and a profound bottleneck in terms of new talent and new ideas. (To be fair, country is not alone in this: In 2012, the K-pop novelty star Psy went to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Rap Songs chart with
“Gangnam Style,”
which was — and remains — one of the biggest viral YouTube songs in history, but was by no means a rap song in the American context.)
Nashville’s initial resistance suggests some unfortunate things about country as a genre: that it might not be able to make fun of itself; that it might look askance at outsiders, especially black performers; that it understands itself only through the lens of protecting its central ideology, and not as an omnivorous sound in dialogue with the rest of pop, and the rest of America. Country music is preoccupied with borders, and it treats each new incursion as an opportunity for identity crisis. It’s a wild contrast with contemporary hip-hop, which understands itself as music that borrows widely, and experiments with glee.
But perhaps the greatest indictment of how the country music leadership handled “Old Town Road” comes from a cursory listen to some other songs on the chart. Take “Look What God Gave Her,” the new single by Thomas Rhett, perhaps the
ur-country gentleman
of the last few years. It’s a soft soul song with a faint disco undertow, nothing country about it beyond the perceived affiliation of the performer. Elsewhere there are soft-rock ballads and R&B songs, none of them subject to anything like the skepticism that has greeted Lil Nas X, whose reference points might in fact be more classically country (even if refracted through a kitsch lens).
Which means that the Lil Nas X controversy boils down to a conversation about who is entitled to lay public claim to Southern tropes that country music believes it has monopolized (but in truth, has been less and less reliant on in recent years). That it’s happening at a moment featuring
more black country music performers
than any in recent memory — Darius Rucker, Kane Brown, Jimmie Allen, Mickey Guyton and many more — is especially discouraging.
On its own terms, “Old Town Road” has been a wild success. And when it comes the music business’s terms, well, that’s being reverse engineered. Following the Cyrus remix,
Lil Nas X teased
another with Young Thug.
In truth, “Old Town Road” isn’t quite fully country or hip-hop, at least not in the ways those genres taxonomize themselves. It’s something far more slippery, slithering between the two spaces and arriving at pop novelty. This is where songs that have been disowned by their ostensible homes but provide uncomplicated pleasure often land — embraced widely even as they’re kept at arms length locally.
But it is too potent to remain that way. It certainly won’t be long before some country singers incorporate it into their live sets. Country stations are beginning to play the song, which serves as a kind of proxy for acceptance. And indeed, Billboard recently announced that it might revisit its decision to include “Old Town Road” on its main country chart — after all, country is as country allows itself to be.

It was only the second flight for what is the most powerful rocket now available on Earth, improving on its spectacular test launch in 2018.
By
Kenneth Chang
The Falcon Heavy roared into space on Thursday night, arcing atop three columns of flame toward orbit with a large satellite on board.
It was the second launch for what is the most powerful rocket in operation today, a reminder of its majestic test launch fourteen months ago from the same launchpad, 39A, at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

At moments, the 2018 launch seemed like a lengthy advertisement for the ambitions of Elon Musk, SpaceX’s founder and chief executive. It carried a spacesuit-wearing mannequin, nicknamed Starman, seated in the driver’s seat of a red Roadster built by Mr. Musk’s other company, Tesla. The sports car and its driver streamed video back to Earth of their journey out into the solar system.
This time, the Falcon Heavy’s cargo was more mundane, but also more useful: Arabsat-6A, a Saudi Arabian communications satellite which will relay television, internet and mobile phone signals to the Middle East, Africa and Europe.
Shortly after the launch, the rocket’s three boosters returned to Earth. Two touched down seconds apart at landing pads at Cape Canaveral, not far from the launchpad. The center booster, which went higher and farther, set down on a floating platform in the Atlantic Ocean.
Sticking that third landing was an advancement for SpaceX, after a similar maneuver failed in 2018 on the first try. The booster then missed the platform, hitting the water at more than 300 miles per hour.
The company’s workhorse is the Falcon 9 rocket, which first launched in 2010. The first stage of the Heavy essentially consists of three Falcon 9 first stages bound together. The second stages of the two rockets are identical.
The additional thrust allows the Heavy to propel 140,000 pounds to low-Earth orbit, nearly three times what the Falcon 9 can lift.
On the test flight, the two side boosters were older versions reused from earlier flights. (SpaceX’s best innovation to date is landing the booster stage of its rockets and launching
it
again; traditionally, rockets have been one-use throwaways, with the booster stages dropped into the ocean.)
For this one, the side boosters had never before been used. They were the latest version of the rocket, called “Block Five.” (“Block” is what rocket companies call a major upgrade.) That boosts the thrust and how much the Falcon Heavy can carry.
Even though the first Falcon Heavy flight appeared to be nearly flawless, SpaceX probably made adjustments. That, after all, is the reason a rocket company performs a test flight for a new rocket design.
SpaceX also has had a backlog of Falcon 9 missions to fly. It launched
20 Falcon
9 missions in 2018, more than in any previous year, in addition to the one Falcon Heavy launch. The company was also busy at work developing its
Crew Dragon capsule for taking NASA astronauts
to and from the International Space Station.
The market for the Falcon Heavy is also much smaller than once envisioned. When Mr. Musk first announced the rocket in 2011, he said he expected that there would be a 50/50 mix between the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy. In the years since, improvements have made the Falcon 9 more powerful, and miniaturization of electronics has shrunk the size of many satellites.
The Falcon Heavy is now needed for only the largest satellites like the 13,000-pound Arabsat-6A satellite, which is headed to geosynchronous orbit more than 22,000 miles above Earth. The satellite could have been launched on a Falcon 9, but with the added thrust of a Heavy, the satellite could use less of its own fuel to reach its final orbit, extending its lifetime.
SpaceX launched its Falcon Heavy rocket for the second time on Thursday.
One more Falcon Heavy flight is scheduled for this year — a mission for the United States Air Force carrying 25 small satellites.
In addition, SpaceX has announced contracts for two Falcon Heavy launches of commercial satellites, and the company has won two competitions to use the rocket for national security missions.
At present, no, but that answer could change.
In 2017, SpaceX announced
that two space tourists would go on an around-the-moon trip
in one of the company’s Crew Dragon capsules launched by a Falcon Heavy. But when the first Heavy reached the launchpad last year, SpaceX said it had decided not to go to the expense and effort of making the rocket safe enough for launching people.
The possibility of using the Falcon Heavy for lunar missions was revived last month by Jim Bridenstine, the NASA administrator, when he told a Senate committee that the big rocket that his agency is developing, the Space Launch System, would not be ready for its first test flight in 2020. NASA was
looking into using commercial rockets as an alternative
, he said.
One of the alternatives was putting the second stage of the Space Launch System on top of a Falcon Heavy first stage. Mr. Bridenstine later said that option was feasible but could not be done by next year, because major changes would be needed to the boosters and SpaceX’s launchpad to accommodate the Frankenstein rocket combination.
Mr. Bridenstine, however, left the door open, saying that NASA would explore all options to meet the Trump administrations goal of sending astronauts back to the moon by the end of 2024.
SpaceX’s
next-generation rocket
was once known as B.F.R. where “B” stood for “big” and “R” stood for “rocket.” It now has the less colorful name Starship.
SpaceX has begun small hop tests of a preliminary design, nicknamed Starhopper. The full-fledged design is to reach orbit and eventually make distant journeys to the moon and Mars, but that is still years away.
One of Starship’s first passengers is to be
Yusaku Maezawa, founder of the online Japanese clothing company Zozo
. Mr. Maezawa had been one of the lunar tourists who had signed up for the Falcon Heavy trip around the moon but now will wait longer for the even larger rocket.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Joe Gibbs has too many winning drivers in his organization. It is a good problem to have, but one that has led to increased speculation about his plans to juggle all his talent.
The Gibbs organization swept Bristol Motor Speedway last weekend as Christopher Bell won the Xfinity Series race Saturday followed by yet another Kyle Busch victory in the Cup race on Sunday. Gibbs drivers have won five of eight Cup races — including the Daytona 500 — and five of seven Xfinity Series races.
It's problematic because Gibbs can't keep Bell stashed away in the Xfinity Series forever and he simply doesn't have available seats for everyone.
Denny Hamlin, a two-time Daytona 500 winner and two-time winner already this season, is signed beyond 2020 and so are Busch and Martin Truex Jr. Erik Jones said at Bristol he is in active conversations on a contract extension with JGR.
But Bell has proven himself time and again in NASCAR's ladder system. He won the Truck Series title in 2017 and followed with seven victories last year in the Xfinity Series while making it to the championship finale. Now he's back in NASCAR's second-tier series for a second season, with the entire industry aware the 24-year-old needs to be promoted to the big leagues.
Gibbs was coy on how he plans to address his abundance of riches.
""You don't comment much on the future other than to say Christopher has a place with us long term, and so does Erik. That's our goal,"" Gibbs said. ""That's what we'll keep working on. It's great to have young people coming, young talent, it's very important for us.""
Gibbs has made cutthroat business moves before, such as letting Joey Logano go when he had the chance to sign Matt Kenseth. While Kenseth won 15 races in five seasons with Gibbs, he also was eventually cycled out when Gibbs needed a seat for Jones. Kenseth is now essentially retired and Logano won last year's Cup championship for Roger Penske.
Daniel Suarez wasn't brought back this season when Gibbs had a chance to add Truex, the 2017 Cup champion. Suarez is off to a decent start with Stewart-Haas Racing.
In theory, both Hamlin and Jones opened the season on the ""hot seat"" because Bell is ready to go Cup racing and Gibbs needs a place to put him. Hamlin was coming off the first winless season of his Cup career, but opened the season with another Daytona 500 win and then added a victory at Texas.
He bristled at speculation Gibbs would move him to make room for Bell.
""Who says I'm on a hot seat? What do they know that I don't? That's what I don't understand,"" Hamlin said. ""You all don't know my relationship with my sponsor, the team or anything. I've never once thought that someone could go out there and do a better job than I could in my own car.""
Jones, in his third full season, won just once last year and hasn't been as competitive so far this year as his Gibbs teammates. But he said his manager is working hard with Gibbs on ironing out an extension, and neither he nor Hamlin has felt job pressure.
""I think both of us have felt pretty comfortable where we're at,"" Jones said. ""I think Christopher is a great driver, but still when he moves to the Cup level, it's going to take time to develop. You're going to take a year or two to really get where you want to be at that level.
""I feel like I'm going to be (at JGR) for a long time. I'm sure Christopher will get his opportunity in Cup at some point. He's definitely got the talent and he's good enough to do it, so he'll get there for sure.""
But where?
Toyota has a partnership with Leavine Family Racing that gives the single-car team technical support and assistance from the Gibbs group. Matt DiBenedetto is in his first year with Leavine and theoretically has the same equipment as the Gibbs drivers. The difference is in depth and resources, and it makes Leavine an iffy proposition for Bell.
A deal could be worked to get Bell in a second Leavine car, but expansion might stretch the small team too far. Bell could also just replace DiBenedetto, but isolating him on a mediocre extension of the big-league team is risky. Bell is considered a rising star because of his dirt track prowess, grassroots racing fan base and his hard-charging style — and racing is a results-driven business. Sticking Bell with the B-team just to get him a seat could backfire if he struggles.
Dave Wilson, president and general manager of Toyota Racing Development, noted driver lineups are up to teams. But he knows the resources that have been put into developing Bell, Jones, Suarez (who now drives a Ford), and even K&N Series driver Hailie Deegan.
""As Toyota has been vested in driver development for several years, we accept that these types of logjams are inevitable,"" Wilson said. ""We're still working with all of our team partners on 2020 plans, but don't have anything to talk about right now.""
The Bell situation needs to be solved. He is ready now and NASCAR is ready for him now. It's not the worst problem for Gibbs, but it could get complicated over the next few months.

AUGUSTA, Ga. — The methodical, ever calculating Bryson DeChambeau, who last week put himself through a 14-hour practice session to decipher the effect of what he called the “spin loft curve” of his wedges, was asked late Thursday to assess the final nine holes of his first round at the 2019 Masters.
DeChambeau, who birdied six of those nine holes, including the last four, responded with neither a technical term nor a scientific one.
“Magical,” he said.
On a favorable weather day that produced 28 rounds under par, DeChambeau was one the last competitors on the Augusta National Golf Club grounds, and he played as if enchanted by a spell.
His last full shot to the 18th hole seemed destined to roll into the hole for an eagle until the flagstick deflected it away. DeChambeau instead tapped in from about 2 inches for a final, stress-free birdie, which gave him a six-under-par 66 and tied him for the lead with Brooks Koepka.
It was just the ninth competitive Masters round for DeChambeau, 25, and the first time he had recorded a score in the 60s. In the past, DeChambeau freely conceded that he felt uncertain in the sanctified setting of golf’s most tradition-laden event.
But on Thursday, DeChambeau showed a newfound maturity.
“It was understanding how to control certain emotions on the golf course,” he said. “Just from a nerve perspective, being comfortable in different situations and being able to say, ‘I can do this, this is not a problem.’”
DeChambeau was far from the only top golfer firing away at greens softened by rain earlier in the week.
Koepka also surged late in his round to remind the field, should anyone forget, that he had won three of the last seven
major championships
, two of them with record scores.
Asked about that, Koepka, 28, said evenly: “I enjoy the big stage. That’s what you’re remembered for.”
One stroke off the lead was Phil Mickelson, who had two bogeys and five birdies on the back nine.
The 48-year-old Mickelson seemed rejuvenated by his round of 67, which matched his score from the final round of last year’s tournament, when he finished in a tie for 36th.
“But this was a lot of fun,” a smiling Michelson said Thursday. “It was great.”
Dustin Johnson, the world’s second-ranked golfer, and Ian Poulter were two strokes behind the leaders.
For most of the early part of the round, the focus was on Tiger Woods, who was tied for the lead with only a few holes left in his first round.
Woods’s surge had the Augusta National galleries in full throat, especially after he made an improbable birdie from the thick trees left of the 14th hole to keep his name atop a leaderboard stocked with many of the world’s top golfers.
“Not a bad start,” Woods said later.
He could not, however, maintain all of the momentum he had built. After Woods missed the green with his approach shot at the par-4 17th hole, his par putt hung on the edge of the cup for a bogey that brought a groan from the crowd circling the green.
Still, Woods finished with his usual flair. After his tee shot at the final hole trickled into a bunker, Woods lofted an iron shot that ascended the intimidating, steep uphill 18th hole and dropped pin high for an easy par.
Woods finished with a 70, the same first-round score he had when he
won the tournament in 1997
, 2001 and 2002. (Woods shot a first-round 74 in his other Masters championship in 2005, which was also the last time he won the tournament.)
Although Woods, after his round, was under the impression he had shot 70 in the first round of each of this Masters victories.
“I’ve shot this number and won four coats, so hopefully I can do it again,” he said, referring to the green jacket awarded Masters winners.
Irrespective of that bit of misremembering, Woods was buoyed by his round. Minutes after it concluded, he had moved past the disappointment of the bogey on the penultimate hole.
“I feel very good,” he said. “I played well and I controlled my golf ball all day. I did all the things I needed to do today to post a good number. I drove it well, hit some good iron shots, speed was good on the greens.
“I was in a position to make a couple of birdies on the front nine and missed those, but I felt confident all day. Those putts were close. Over all, I was pleased.”
At the 14th hole, after yanking his tee shot into the woods left of the fairway, he skied a short iron over the trees that settled on the green about 20 feet from the hole.
Because it was a tricky, double-breaking putt, Woods struck his next shot cautiously. In fact, he was not even trying to sink the putt.
“I was just trying to lag it down there,” Woods said. “It’s uphill and then really quick downhill, and I had a little ridge right in the line, too.”
The putt dropped into the hole, and patrons surrounding the green roared. All around Augusta National, Woods’s name vaulted up the hand-operated scoreboards, sending a buzz through the grounds.
Afterward, Woods smiled easily and seemed to enjoy the attention. But in his 22nd Masters, Woods knew how much more golf was left to play.
“We still have a long way to go,” he said. “I tee off late tomorrow, and the wind’s supposed to be up, so I have my work cut out for me the rest of the week. But so does everyone else.”
Several golfers who teed off Thursday morning, like Woods, had strong rounds, including Jon Rahm, who finished with a three-under 69. Also at three under were the former Masters champion Adam Scott and the South African Justin Harding, who was playing in his first Masters.
Harding appeared a bit awed by his first-round result.
“Yeah, I’ll take it and run if I can,” he said, then added, “Oh, wait, we’re not allowed to run here at Augusta.”
Walking only is a rule at Augusta National, for spectators and players.
“Let’s just say I’m pleased,” Harding said.
Rickie Fowler, last year’s Masters runner-up, was tied with Woods, as were eight others, including Jason Day, Gary Woodland, J. B. Holmes and Corey Conners, the winner of last weekend’s Texas Open.
The defending champion, Patrick Reed, shot 73, as did the 2017 winner, Sergio García.
An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of one of the competitors. His name is Jon Rahm, not John.

MINNEAPOLIS — The plains of West Texas are a long way from the bustling piazzas and porticos of northern Italy, where Davide Moretti was raised in a soccer culture and basketball was just a niche.
But NBA fans in Italy can now look to the likes of Danilo Gallinari and his 20-point scoring average for the Los Angeles Clippers in a league that has made major strides in Europe since Moretti was born in Bologna 21 years ago.
The college game, however, has been a decidedly foreign concept overseas, though, with the term March Madness likely to elicit strange looks even if correctly translated.
Well, there's hardly been an NCAA championship with more of a global presence than this one, with Moretti's Texas Tech Red Raiders facing the Virginia Cavaliers in the title game Monday night. Eight players are from other countries.
Moretti, the sophomore starting guard for Texas Tech , once played on an Italian junior national team with Virginia forward Francesco Badocchi, who has redshirted his first season.
""We're the first Italian guys who have ever made it to the Final Four,"" Moretti said, ""so it's kind of a big-time thing right now back in Italy for basketball.""
According to data calculated by digital content producer Hero Sports, of the 1,036 players in this year's NCAA Tournament, 117 listed a home country other than the United States. Canada (23) contributed the most, followed by Australia (14). Seventeen other countries produced at least two players, including seven from African nations.
For an American kid, a shooting session in the driveway after dinner could naturally include a singing of ""One Shining Moment"" and an idyllic vision of cutting down the nets at the national championship game. Not so much in other countries, where the presence of soccer and the significant time zone difference have long been more than enough to keep college basketball in the dark.
""When the games are on, it's usually when we're at school and stuff like that so we don't get to watch it because we're doing other things,"" said Kody Stattmann, another Virginia redshirt and a native of Australia.
Starting forward Mamadi Diakite, whose buzzer-beating shot sent the Cavaliers to overtime in the Elite Eight where they outlasted Purdue, has become a national hero in Guinea. In Africa, though, his family and friends have to settle for watching replays.
""The day after the game, I get texts about it,"" Diakite said.
For many of these international players, then, the desire to drape a gold, silver or bronze medal around their neck can be a bigger goal than winning an NCAA title with their college teams, as exhilarating as that can be.
""Playing in an Olympics is something that everybody dreams of,"" said Moretti, who will try to make the Italian national team for the FIBA World Cup this summer.
Moretti played on junior teams in European and world championships, burnishing his credentials as one of the top international prospects before choosing Texas Tech over Indiana, Connecticut and Utah.
Badocchi moved to the U.S. earlier to further develop his game in high school in Kansas, his mother's home state. Her work in the fashion industry brought her to Milan, where she met Badocchi's father.
""Since my family was from Kansas, I knew about KU, but I didn't really watch March Madness or anything like that,"" Badocchi said. ""Even coming to Virginia, I knew it was a very good school, but I didn't really know anything about the ACC or anything.""
The ACC is quite the challenge, of course, and the Cavaliers have recently cracked the conference elite with Duke and North Carolina under coach Tony Bennett. Perhaps one of the ways they'll be able to stay there for the long term is with these international pipelines that have not only opened with new talent source but created stronger chemistry off the court.
""You learn to appreciate and respect one another,"" Bennett said.
Also playing for the Cavaliers is fifth-year senior center Jack Salt of New Zealand. Another redshirt, center Francisco Caffaro, is from Argentina. Freshman guard Kihei Clark is from California but has a Filipino mother. Diakite, a fourth-year junior, recalled having to use his smartphone to translate words in some of his earlier conversations with teammates.
""At first, I think it's very hard if I were from here to accept someone to take someone from somewhere else that doesn't speak my language. I'd have to buy in a lot of time to talk to them,"" Diakite said. ""But for them, being able to take their time and talk to me so I could be on the same layer as them is tremendous. Everyone has done such a good job of taking me in the circle.""
Texas Tech will add two more international big men to the roster next season: Russel Tchewa from Cameroon and Andrei Savrasov of Russia. In addition to Moretti, there's fifth-year senior guard Brandone Francis (Dominican Republic) and freshman forward Josh Mballa (France).
""We try to be a family for these guys because they come here far away from home. That's what I did for the other guys who did to me, which was such a great thing for me because I felt like I wasn't alone,"" Moretti said.
Yes, it's hard not to find a friend in West Texas.
""Everything is bigger. Everything is wider,"" Moretti said. ""It's just a different culture. I like it. It's my home. The people are so nice. I live in the gym basically, but when I step out of the gym the people are so nice.""

WASHINGTON — Where most ""Game of Thrones"" fans were horrified by the beheading of the beloved Ned Stark and blamed it on a ruthless king, Columbia University business professor Bruce Craven saw a lesson in failed leadership.
The northerner Stark was simply too proud to adjust to the cutthroat nature of King's Landing as it became mired in a scramble over royal succession. His execution set into motion battles, intrigues, romances and resurrections that will culminate this Sunday with the show's highly-anticipated final season.
In the AP's weekly ""Wealth of Westeros"" series, we'll be delving into the latest plot twists and analyzing the economic and business forces driving the story. We examine the show's central question in Part 1: Who will win the Iron Throne?
The judgment of Craven and other academic minds may surprise you: Sansa Stark, Ned's eldest daughter.
Sansa has grown from a once-helpless princess with dreams of lemon cakes into a wily strategist. She has endured marriages that were degrading and abusive, finding ways to adapt and survive that her late father could never manage.
""She's had probably the closest involvement with the widest array of different leaders,"" said Craven, who has written a new business book, ""Win or Die: Leadership Secrets from Game of Thrones .""
Sansa has learned from Littlefinger's manipulations. She's seen the pitfalls from what Craven calls Cersei's ""transactional"" approach to leadership. And she's seen her kinsman Jon Snow's idealism transform him from a brooding teenager into a military commander capable of challenging the zombie army of the Night King.
This education might be the ultimate advantage, even if she lacks the firepower of Daenerys Targaryen's dragons or the Valyrian steel sword wielded by Jon Snow.
""She doesn't have dragons. She didn't learn to become an assassin,"" added Craven, who admits his prediction is just a hunch. ""Everything she's gone through, part of me wants to see her leverage that in some unpredictable way.""
Sansa does enjoy a major edge in terms of resources, said Mark Wright, research director at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. From the U.S. Civil War to World War II, victorious armies have often gained a decisive edge by having the best equipment, stable supply lines and multitudes of soldiers. Her perceived rivals for the throne are running close to empty militarily and economically.
Thanks to her feeble cousin Robin Arryn, the Knights of the Vale are under her command. Her troops are the freshest and arguably best provisioned, given the Vale's rich soil that provides for wheat, corn, barley and enviously large pumpkins.
Her rivals have suffered the destruction of their farmland and the depletion of their armies after years of warfare and the occasional scorched-earth dragon attack.
""I think it was Napoleon who said an army marches on its stomach,"" Wright said.
Not everyone, however, is convinced that Sansa will rule.
The betting markets have picked Bran Stark, her mystical and disabled brother.
He might also seem like an unexpected pick. Bran has the ability to journey through time. This gives him an oracular power, but it has extinguished his former emotional warmth for cold prophecies. He seems too detached from humanity to sit on the Iron Throne or establish the personal connections that a ruler would need to rally a weary populace.
But to economists, his popularity on the betting markets matters a lot.
The market is the closest thing the public has to a three-eyed raven. It can forecast the future by distilling the wisdom of the crowds. The stock and bond markets do this daily.
He has no charisma and can't fight, and the show suggested last season that he's no longer even a Stark. But Boyle Sports gives him 4/5 odds. He's the top pick on Bovada, too. And on Oddschecker. And Gambling.com.
But of course, markets can be wrong. So can experts.
Carolyne Larrington, a professor of medieval European literature at Oxford and author of ""Winter is Coming: The Medieval World of Game of Thrones ,"" doesn't think Sansa wants to sit on the Iron Throne, any more than her father did.
Instead, she sees Daenerys as the most likely choice, with her dragons and Dothraki hordes.
Larrington said the show, once known for its moral shades of gray, has become more clearly a fight of good vs. evil as it nears its end.
""I think that's why they'll play it safe, and give it to Daenerys,"" she said.
Craven credits Daenerys with having developed superior leadership skills: She inspires people by walking into flames and surviving. She frees slaves and tries to rule for the benefit of others. Plus, she has dragons.
She is ""the queen we chose,"" in the words of her interpreter and adviser, Missandei.
It's a surprisingly positive lesson from a show that has relentlessly crushed so many beloved characters.
""All the leadership that goes forward successfully against the odds — with the exception of Cersei — involves leaders that are motivated by helping other people,"" Craven says. ""Their leadership isn't strictly about their own achievement or standing at the top of the org chart.""
Let's hope that leadership style works against the army of the Night King.

WELLINGTON, New Zealand — Less than a month after 50 Muslim worshipers in the city of Christchurch were fatally shot in terrorist attacks on two mosques, New Zealand passed a law banning most semiautomatic weapons on Wednesday — a measure supported by all but one of Parliament’s 120 lawmakers.
The passage of the bill means
temporary restrictions imposed by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern
six days after the massacre, to prevent New Zealanders from stockpiling guns before the law went into effect, will now be permanent. The
swift action by lawmakers
stands in stark contrast to similar efforts in the United States, where nationwide gun control proposals have stalled despite a series of mass shootings in recent years.
“New Zealand stands apart in its widespread availability of weapons of such destructive nature and force,” Ms. Ardern told Parliament on Wednesday. “Today that anomaly ends.”
Many Americans can buy a gun in less than an hour. In New Zealand, the process can take weeks or months.
She said she could not have faced the surviving victims of the Christchurch attack “hand on heart” and told them “our system and our laws allow these guns to be available and that is O.K. It is not.”
The law outlaws military-style semiautomatic weapons and assault rifles, and violators face five years in prison. Some semiautomatic guns will still be allowed, including .22-caliber rifles with magazines holding fewer than 10 rounds, and shotguns with internal magazines that hold no more than five rounds. All of the weapons used by the Christchurch gunman will be banned, as well as parts and magazines that can convert lower-powered guns to higher-powered versions.
In her speech, Ms. Ardern, who leads the center-left Labour Party, choked up when she talked about visiting surviving victims at Christchurch Hospital.
In addition to those killed
, 50 people were injured in the attack.
“None of them had one gunshot wound. In every case they spoke of multiple injuries,” Ms. Ardern said. “They will carry disabilities for a lifetime, and that’s before you even consider the psychological impact.”
Similar laws had been recommended to New Zealand’s Parliament several times before, but each time they had failed to gain support from lawmakers — including after the mass shooting that had previously been New Zealand’s largest, in which a gunman killed 13 people in 1990.
This time, the bill quickly sailed through Parliament. Usually in New Zealand, new laws can take around six months to pass after they are introduced. More than 13,000 people submitted opinions to the government — 60 percent in support of the ban — and some were invited to speak to lawmakers in a single day of public hearings.
But while sports shooters and farmers were among those who pleaded for exemptions to the restrictions, lawmakers allowed just two: for commercial pest-control businesses and for licensed collectors of guns, or those who want to keep particular guns as heirlooms or mementos. Collectors will be required to remove a part, making the weapons nonoperational, and store that part at a different location.
Ms. Ardern’s center-right opponents used their speeches on Wednesday to praise her leadership since the March 15 attacks and voice their support for the changes. Just one, David Seymour, the leader of the libertarian ACT Party, voted against the law.
Mr. Seymour said he was not opposed to more restrictive gun laws but believed that Parliament had rushed the process. “It is not an attempt to improve public safety, it is an exercise in political theater,” said Mr. Seymour, who argued that there was a risk of a growing black market in banned weapons.
Ms. Ardern had dismissed concerns that Parliament was moving too fast. “My question here is simple: You either believe that in New Zealand these weapons have a place or you do not. And if you do not, you should be able to agree that we can move swiftly,” she said. “My view is that an argument about process is an argument to do nothing.”
Many commentators welcomed the new measures but said work remained to be done to ensure that gun regulations were properly enforced. The government said more measures, including a requirement to register individual firearms, would be in place by the end of the year.
“We really need to have a system where we understand where all the firearms in New Zealand are,” said Chris Cahill, president of the Police Association, a national union for police officers. He added that gun owners should be forced to justify wanting to own large numbers of guns, something he said “hadn’t been challenged enough” in the past.

New Zealand’s Muslim leaders agreed that the new law should be just a starting point for more regulation.
“This is a law that should have been passed many years ago,” said Mustafa Farouk, the president of the Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand. Speaking of the families of the victims, he said, “Passing that law is part of justice for them.”
Because Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II is technically New Zealand’s head of state, her representative, New Zealand’s governor-general, will now give the final approval to pass the bill into law. This is considered a formality, and is due to happen Thursday.
The government has also established a gun buyback plan, which will run for six months for legal owners of the weapons now banned.
John Hart, a sheep and beef farmer from Masterton on New Zealand’s North Island, said he had already turned in one weapon — which he had owned for 10 years — to the police, because after the attacks he felt “uncomfortable” in possession of it.
“In the weeks or months or years before Friday the 15th, I hadn’t thought about it. It was just a tool,” he said, adding that after the shootings he realized that in the wrong hands “it was a terrible weapon.”

Marilynn Smith, who help found the Ladies Professional Golf Association in 1950, when the women’s game was barely a blip on the national sports scene, and went on to win 21 tour events, including two major championships, died on Tuesday in Goodyear, Ariz. She was 89.
Her death, which was
announced by the L.P.G.A.
on its website, left
Marlene Bauer Hagge
and
Shirley Spork
as the last survivors among the 13 pioneers of the women’s tour.
The L.P.G.A. said Smith, who would have turned 90 on Saturday, made her last public appearance on March 24 greeting players as they walked off the 18th green at the Bank of Hope Founders Cup tournament in Phoenix.
During its first season
, the L.P.G.A. sponsored a dozen or so tournaments, with prize money totaling just $50,000.
Babe Didrikson Zaharias
, an Olympic track and field champion in 1932, and
Patty Berg
were the main draws at first, but Smith, as well as co-founders like Hagge,
Louise Suggs
and
Betty Jameson
, became prominent golf pros in their own right.
Last year, the L.P.G.A. sponsored 32 events in 13 countries with $65.35 million in prize money.
Smith captured the 1963 and 1964 Titleholders Championship, an L.P.G.A. major tournament of her era, which was played at Augusta Country Club in Georgia, adjacent to Augusta National Golf Club, the home of the Masters. She won her first L.P.G.A. tournament in 1954 and her last in 1972.
While serving as L.P.G.A. president from 1958 to 1960, Smith was instrumental in founding the organization’s teaching division, now known as the L.P.G.A. Teaching and Club Professional Membership. She gave clinics throughout the United States and in 37 other countries and was the first woman to be a television analyst for men’s pro golf tournaments. She worked with ABC at the 1973 United States Open, at Oakmont in Pennsylvania, and the Colonial, in Fort Worth.
She was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2006.
The L.P.G.A. was the successor to the Women’s Professional Golf Association, which was founded during World War II but disbanded in 1949 after incurring financial difficulties. In the L.P.G.A.’s early years, it struggled as well, receiving little notice in the press or on the radio and having no TV exposure.
The women also lacked the funds to fly, so
they traveled to tournaments in caravans
of four or five automobiles when the interstate highway system was in its infancy.
When they reached a tournament site, they had to sell their product to the locals. Smith, an exuberant woman who seemed just right for publicizing the tour, was given the nickname Miss Personality for her cheerleading.
“We would go to major league ball parks, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Washington, D.C., and hit golf balls from home plate out to center field, with a 9 or an 8 iron, and then we’d get on the microphone and ask those baseball fans to come out and see the L.P.G.A. play,” she told The Arizona Republic long afterward.
The women were also the tournament directors and rules makers, and they called in results to the news agencies and newspapers. Tournament sites came and went. “We might get one event one year; the next year it was gone,” Smith told The Dallas Morning News in 2000.
Marilynn Smith was born on April 29, 1929, in Topeka, Kan., to Lynn and Alma Smith. Her father was an insurance executive.
In her pre-teenage years, Marilynn managed and pitched for a boys’ baseball team. As she once told golf.com: “I came home from pitching one day and my mother said, ‘Well, how did you do today, dear?’ I threw my mitt against the wall and I said, ‘Oh, —,’ a four-letter word beginning with S that I had learned from the boys on the sandlot. And she marched me into the lavatory and washed my mouth out with soap.”
When her father came home and learned of her outburst, she recalled, he said, “We better take her out to the Wichita Country Club and teach her a more ladylike sport.”
Her childhood dream was to play baseball for the St. Louis Cardinals, but she agreed to take golf lessons from a country-club pro. Captivated by the sport, she went on to win three state amateur championships and the 1949 national collegiate golf championship as a sophomore at the University of Kansas. She turned pro after that when the Spalding sporting goods company gave her a contract to promote its equipment at clinics.
Smith received the first Patty Berg Award for distinguished service to women’s golf in 1979. In her later years she sponsored a tournament raising scholarship money for female high school seniors planning to continue to play golf in college. Living in Goodyear, a suburb of Phoenix, she played recreationally until she was about 70, when her knees gave out. There was no immediate word on her survivors.
Smith estimated that she had given 4,000 clinics in the United States and abroad. On one of her four trips to New Zealand, she inspired a 10-year-old girl named Marilyn Smith to take up golf. In the 1970s, that
Marilyn Smith
became the first pro player from her country to join the L.P.G.A. Tour.
“With Marilynn Smith as a founding member still playing, they called me MJ Smith,” she once told Wellington Golf, which advises golf clubs in the vicinity of New Zealand’s capital. “Though they did send one of my prize checks to her by mistake.”
An earlier version of this obituary misstated the location in Georgia of the Titleholders Championship, which Smith won in 1963 and 1964. It was Augusta Country Club, not Augusta National Golf Club.

LONDON — A British man whose girlfriend died after they were both poisoned by a nerve agent thought to have been discarded by Russian intelligence officers in England went looking for answers at the Russian Embassy in London this weekend, asking, “Why did your country kill my girlfriend?”
The startling meeting — which at times seemed more like a friendly tour of the embassy in South Kensington, an affluent area in West London, than an inquisition of a representative of the government potentially responsible for the death of his girlfriend, Dawn Sturgess, in July — left more questions than answers.
The meeting between the man, Charlie Rowley, and Russia’s ambassador to Britain, Alexander V. Yakovenko, on Saturday was partly arranged by The Sunday Mirror, a British tabloid.
Mr. Rowley met with Russia’s envoy nine months after he and Ms. Sturgess were poisoned by a nerve agent that the authorities say was originally used to target a former Russian spy, Sergei V. Skripal, in March 2018. But Mr. Skripal’s daughter, Yulia, and a police officer were also sickened.
The poisoning was at the center of a diplomatic split between Britain and Russia, leading both countries to engage in tit-for-tat expulsions of each others’ diplomats. Mr. Rowley also lost some of his eyesight, suffered strokes and contracted meningitis after the attack.
But on Sunday, the BBC showed images of Mr. Rowley shaking the hands of the smiling ambassador as Mr. Rowley’s brother Matthew sat in a wheelchair in the room. The envoy also is seen showing the Britons around the embassy.
“I went along to ask them ‘Why did your country kill my girlfriend?,’ ” Mr. Rowley said in an
interview
with The Sunday Mirror. “But I didn’t really get any answers,” Mr. Rowley added. “I just got Russian propaganda.”
Mr. Yakovenko denied that Russia had been behind the poisonings. He then asked his visitors to pass his “best regards to the parents” of Ms. Sturgess.
“I know how it was hard for them,” he said, according to video footage published by The Sunday Mirror, and in an apparent appeal for cooperation, added, “But we should be together, definitely.”
Neither The Sunday Mirror nor the Russian Embassy responded to requests for comment on Sunday. Mr. Rowley could not immediately be reached.
Russia has always denied any role in poisoning Mr. Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury, England, with the military-grade nerve agent, Novichok. But the British authorities say it had been the work of at least two Russian intelligence officers, Anatoly V. Chepiga and Aleksandr Y. Mishkin, who were caught on CCTV entering the country and traveling to Salisbury.
In an interview with the state-run Russian network RT, both
claimed they were sports nutritionists
who had visited Salisbury as tourists because of its remarkable cathedral.
But the British authorities say they believe that the Russians had carelessly discarded the remaining poison, which was found by Mr. Rowley while he was rummaging through a dumpster.
Ms. Sturgess, 44,
fell ill in Amesbury
, a town in southern England, after Mr. Rowley, 45, gave her a small glass bottle he had found in a box in the trash. He thought the oily substance inside the bottle was perfume.
She sprayed it on her wrist, and rubbed her hands together
, he later told the authorities.
A week later she was dead, and he was in a coma.
It was only when he regained consciousness in a hospital that the police told him that the substance was Novichok, he said in an interview with the British television channel ITV in July.
The authorities said at the time that Mr. Rowley and Ms. Sturgess had most likely been accidentally exposed to the poison.
In March, Ewan Hope, the son of Ms. Sturgess,
asked President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia
to allow British investigators to question the men presumed responsible, telling Mr. Putin, “I am appealing to you as a human being.”
“Allow our officers to question these men about my mother’s murder,” he urged Mr. Putin on the anniversary of the nerve agent attack on Mr. Skripal,
according to excerpts from a letter published in The Mirror
.
In denying its role in the poisonings, Russia has also satirized the episode. In December, RT sent around chocolate replicas of Salisbury Cathedral as holiday gifts.
But on Saturday, the Russian ambassador handed Mr. Rowley a 51-page dossier titled “Salisbury: Unanswered Questions,” in which Britain is accused of “inaccuracies and inconsistencies,” and of “failing to provide information,” according to The Sunday Mirror.
Mr. Yakovenko later told reporters that the meeting had been “quite a friendly event.” He added of Mr. Rowley: “It was an ordinary conversation between friends. He just wanted to know the truth.”
The envoy also told Mr. Rowley that the British police had never asked to interview the two suspects. But Mr. Rowley did not appear to be convinced by much of what he heard.
“He hasn’t changed my view that Russia” is responsible, he said.
Mr. Rowley told The Mirror, “He said Russia only have small amounts of Novichok because they use it as an antidote and don’t produce it any more.”
“He said the only countries that produce it now are the Czech Republic and America,” he added.
“I said, ‘Well, my girlfriend did die; it’s only because I washed it off that I’m still here,’ ” Mr. Rowley said. “He didn’t know what to say to that.”

Is Joe Biden the Democrats’ best hope to beat President Trump in 2020? Or is the former vice president woefully behind the times? This week on “The Argument,” Michelle Goldberg says that allegations of inappropriate touching are just one reason Biden is too out of step with his party to run for president. Ross Douthat thinks Mr. Biden should run by defending his record as a moderate, not distancing himself from it. And David Leonhardt argues that a Biden candidacy could help the Democratic Party, even if he doesn’t win the nomination.
Then, why are young Americans having less sex — and what does it say about the country? The columnists debate the origins and meaning of America’s sex recession.
And finally, as we await the final season of “Game of Thrones,” Ross recommends a fantasy book series that is
actually
complete.
Background Reading:
Ross on
why Biden should run on his record, not against it
and
America’s “sexual recession”
Michelle on
accusations of inappropriate touching and why Biden shouldn’t run
David on
why Biden should run
and
Times readers coming to Biden’s defense
“Why Are Young People Having So Little Sex?” (
Kate Julian, The Atlantic
)
“The share of Americans not having sex has reached a record high” (
Christopher Ingraham, The Washington Post
)
I’ve been an Op-Ed columnist since 2009, and I write about politics, religion, pop culture, sociology and the places where they all intersect. I’m a Catholic and a conservative, in that order, which means that I’m against abortion and critical of the sexual revolution, but I tend to agree with liberals that the Republican Party is too friendly to the rich. I was against Donald Trump in 2016 for reasons specific to Donald Trump, but in general I think the populist movements in Europe and America have legitimate grievances and I often prefer the populists to the “reasonable” elites. I’ve written books about Harvard, the G.O.P., American Christianity and Pope Francis; I’m working on one about decadence. Benedict XVI was my favorite pope. I review movies for National Review and have strong opinions about many prestige television shows. I have three small children, two girls and a boy, and I live in New Haven with my wife.
I’ve been an Op-Ed columnist at The New York Times since 2017, writing mainly about politics, ideology and gender. These days people on the right and the left both use “liberal” as an epithet, but that’s basically what I am, though the nightmare of Donald Trump’s presidency has radicalized me and pushed me leftward. I’ve written three books, including one, in 2006, about the danger of right-wing populism in its religious fundamentalist guise. (My other two were about the global battle over reproductive rights and, in a brief detour from politics, about an adventurous Russian émigré who helped bring yoga to the West.) I love to travel; a long time ago, after my husband and I eloped, we spent a year backpacking through Asia. Now we live in Brooklyn with our son and daughter.
I’ve worked at The Times since 1999 and have been an Op-Ed columnist since 2016. I caught the journalism bug a very long time ago — first as a little kid in the late 1970s who loved reading the Boston Globe sports section and later as a teenager working on my high school and college newspapers. I discovered that when my classmates and I put a complaint in print, for everyone to see, school administrators actually paid attention. I’ve since worked as a metro reporter at The Washington Post and a writer at BusinessWeek magazine. At The Times, I started as a reporter in the business section and have also been a Times Magazine staff writer, the Washington bureau chief and the founding editor of The Upshot.
My politics are left of center. But I’m also to the right of many Times readers. I think education reform has accomplished a lot. I think two-parent families are good for society. I think progressives should be realistic about the cultural conservatism that dominates much of this country. Most of all, however, I worry deeply about today’s Republican Party, which has become dangerously extreme. This country faces some huge challenges — inequality, climate change, the rise of China — and they’ll be very hard to solve without having both parties committed to the basic functioning of American democracy.

(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s
the sign-up
.)
Good evening. Here’s the latest.
1. President Trump
wants the Federal Reserve under his thumb.
Mr. Trump
put pressure on the Fed
to boost the economy, calling for the bank to restore financial-crisis-era measures amid one of the longest economic expansions in U.S. history. Above, Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Fed, in December.
The president’s comments coincide with efforts to install allies at the traditionally independent central bank, including
Herman Cain
, a former pizza executive and presidential hopeful.
Separately, the U.S. added 196,000 jobs in March.
Here’s the takeaway
.
And in other Washington news, a private lawyer retained by Mr. Trump to fight Democratic demands for his tax returns told the Treasury Department that
a request by a House committee was an abuse of power
.
_____
2. “We don’t have room.
That means you can’t take em.”
President Trump visited the southern border a day after backing down from his threat to close it.
The president’s visit to Calexico, Calif.,
was intended to highlight what he and his aides say is an out-of-control immigration crisis.
“I don’t think anyone has ever expressed it like that but I am expressing it like that,” Mr. Trump added. “When it’s full, it’s full.”
Our reporters visited with migrants in Mexico
who are seeking asylum in the U.S., many of whom are living in fear.
And in Honduras, one of the deadliest places to be a woman, a writer for our Opinion section investigated the sadism that has
migrants running for the border
.
_____
3.
From the border
to Guantánamo Bay, Cuba:
The Guantánamo war court is still wrestling with how to handle what the U.S. did to Al Qaeda suspects in the C.I.A. black sites. The military tribunals originally barred public mention of what happened at the prisons, including the topic of torture.
Now a key question is
what evidence terrorism suspects can use as the cases inch forward
in the proceedings at Guantánamo.
_____
4. Joe Biden
twice jokingly referred to complaints about his physical contact
before giving an apology
.
“I’m sorry I didn’t understand more,” Mr. Biden said about his hugs and kisses to women over the years. “I’m not sorry for any of my intentions.”
At a union convention, his first public event since complaints emerged from several women, the former vice president hugged the union’s president. “I just want you to know I had permission to hug Lonnie,” he said, and the largely male crowd burst into laughter.
This week, hundreds of Times readers shared their reactions to the unfolding accusations against Mr. Biden.
Here is a selection of them
.
_____
5.
Boeing
said it was slowing down the production of the 737 Max in a growing crisis for the company.
After two of the planes were involved in fatal crashes in five months, the company said it would
reduce the rate at which it produces the jet
to 42 airplanes a month from 52.
The move comes as the jet remains grounded around the world, and after Boeing paused deliveries of new planes, creating a backlog on its production lines in Renton, Wash., pictured above. The Seattle region is feeling the pain from Boeing’s troubles, but few doubt that the company will be
able to move on from its troubles, as it has before
.
_____
6. “Just a regular dude
from L.A.”
That was the Game, a friend and rapper who collaborated with Nipsey Hussle, the Los Angeles rapper who was killed last weekend. Regional legends like Nipsey Hussle often stay close to home. But that same accessibility and dedication to their communities can also
make them reachable targets
. Above, mourners gathered for a vigil this week.
On Thursday,
prosecutors charged
Eric R. Holder Jr. with the rapper’s murder.
We took a look at the lawyer representing him, Chris Darden
. He was once called a “sellout” for prosecuting O.J. Simpson. Now, he’s being criticized by some in Los Angeles for defending the man accused of killing Nipsey Hussle.
_____
7.
Arike Ogunbowale
is on the verge of joining a rare group of athletes so well known that they can go by just their first name.
The Notre Dame guard has made buzzer-beaters when they mattered most, participated on “Dancing With the Stars” and won the ESPY Award for play of the year. Through it all, she always chooses to promote her game,
our college sports reporter writes
.
Here’s a preview of
tonight’s Women’s Final Four
, which features three teams (including
Notre Dame
) that have at least one national title.
Separately,
the University of North Carolina women’s basketball coach, Sylvia Hatchell, was placed on leave after players’ families complained to university officials about
racially insensitive comments
.
_____
8. How country is country
enough for Billboard?
The song “Old Town Road” by Lil Nas X has the boomy trap of hip-hop and the lilt of country twang. The song made it to three of Billboard’s premier charts: Hot 100 for pop singles, Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Country Songs. Until last week.
The trade publication
removed the song from its country chart
and deemed it insufficiently country, setting off criticism that called the decision unfair and even racist. Lil Nas X, above, made a countermove. On Friday, he released a remix of the song with the singer Billy Ray Cyrus, a former country charts topper.
_____
9. And now
for some Instagram catnip.
Cj Hendry’s hyper-realist pencil drawings
leave hundreds of thousands of followers in awe. She’s hoping a solo exhibition and an artistic shift will bring her closer to art-world acceptance.
For a different kind of swipe: The “Seven Day Book Challenge” asks users to post photos of book covers on a social media platform every day for a week. It quickly becomes, as one participant put it, a “fall down a very welcome rabbit hole.”
Our reporter took the bait
.
We also talked to Rickey Thompson, who built a social media following by posting bite-size spicy takes.
Here’s his guide to becoming famous
.
_____
10. Finally, a lizard
of another color.
Scientists introduced the first gene-edited reptile,
a nearly transparent Anolis lizard
. Scientists have been altering genes of other animals for quite some time, but reptiles remained elusive. The success of the albino lizard could open doors to combating pathogens and environmental threats to reptiles, and further study of their evolution.
If you’re more of a shark person, you can watch a
great white shark hunting through a kelp forest
for its next meal (and maybe even feel like one, too — the camera is attached to the shark’s dorsal fin). The video collected by researchers revealed a surprising hunting behavior that had never been documented in sharks.
Happy exploring this weekend.

JAKARTA — ""Mama, just killed a man,"" sings Indonesian President Joko Widodo during a recent ride in a local YouTube celebrity's car while Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody plays in the background.
The video, which also shows Widodo dressed in a red zip-up jacket and jeans chatting about family life and the pressures of running the world's third-largest democracy, was the brainchild of a backroom team that has become a vital part of his campaign for re-election on April 17.
The team, comprised mainly of people in their 20s, has a sleek, high-rise office in central Jakarta. On a recent visit, Reuters saw the team's data of social media activity on the Indonesian presidential election displayed on LED screens covering one wall of a conference room.
Widodo's aides say the team uses the data to determine the pop-culture references that the president will make in his next speech - he's done ""Games of Thrones"" and the ""Avengers"" already - or the sneakers he might wear to an event to appeal to young voters. Widodo's sons also sometimes advise him on outfits or speeches, according to one senior campaign aide.
Millennials - those aged 17-35 – account for over one third of Indonesia's 193 million voters and both Widodo and his challenger, former general Prabowo Subianto, have ramped up efforts to appeal to them.
""Just because of the sheer size of that voter base, the millennials will play an important role in deciding the direction of the election,"" said Djayadi Hanan of pollster Saiful Mujani Research & Consulting.
Most opinion polls show Widodo, 57, holding a double-digit lead over his opponent. A recent survey by pollster Roy Morgan showed around 60 percent of young voters favoring Widodo, but both campaigns say that wooing the country's largely apolitical youth is a challenge.
A former furniture-maker who grew up in a riverside slum and is the first national leader to come from outside the political and military elite, Widodo's everyman image resonated in 2014 with voters tired of the old guard.
But since taking office, aides say, young supporters ""no longer recognized"" the president and he was advised to project a more relaxed image.
""Because he has had to become more stately, that 'village boy' narrative was missing this time,"" said the senior campaign aide, who declined to be identified.
That's where the backroom team came in.
""We're able to see in real-time what does well or what people react negatively to ... We were very blunt in conveying that to the president,"" the aide said, adding that Widodo gets a summary of the social media data almost daily.
JEANS AND SNEAKERS
Where his rival often wears fitted suits and oxford shoes, Widodo sports a white shirt with rolled-up sleeves, jeans, and brightly colored sneakers. In March, the president posted an animated comic strip on social media that showed him meeting his younger self and discussing the achievements of his government.
Taking a page from Indian Prime Minister's Narendra Modi's playbook, Widodo has started using a holographic projection of himself to address voters at campaign rallies.
Analysts say Prabowo is less popular among young voters, in part because of a strongman image stemming from his time as special forces chief under authoritarian ruler Suharto. Aides have suggested softening the image of the 67-year-old, so he now wears a khaki shirt and aviator sunglasses at campaign rallies.
""It was rare to see his lighter side and sense of humor. We have tried to expose that side of him,"" said campaign spokesman Dahnil Anzar.
Prabowo's team has also posted a photograph of him with his cat, which was popular online. The cat now has its own Instagram account.
Prabowo's running mate, businessman and amateur marathon runner Sandiaga Uno, was chosen in part for his massive appeal both online and offline with young and female voters.
As the keynote speaker at a recent event for young entrepreneurs, Uno, 49, joined a group of breakdancers on stage before kicking footballs into a crowd of university students.
Uno's popularity and extensive campaigning across the country has helped boost Prabowo's electability, aides say.
DESPERATE PROMISES
Nevertheless, many young voters want policy pledges to address job creation and youth unemployment, not campaign gimmicks.
Unemployment, at about 5 percent, is one of the highest in Southeast Asia, and many of those without jobs are graduates of vocational schools.
In what was widely seen as an attempt to win votes, Widodo last month promised cash benefits to graduates from poor families and the unemployed, but did not offer details. Critics questioned the feasibility of such a plan, citing an already strained national budget.
Prabowo and his running mate have promised ""entrepreneurial training"" for graduates.
""Our biggest concern is how to get a job after we graduate and who is the leader who can give us that,"" said Haliza Aulia Madina, a 19-year-old student studying Arabic in the city of Bandung, who supports Prabowo.

Current Events Conversation
By
The Learning Network
For the past couple of weeks in Current Events Conversation, we’ve been challenging students to talk to each other in the comments sections of our
writing prompts
.
This week, we want to point out a few of the unique benefits they get from interacting with each other in our online forum — and, of course, highlight student examples of each.
Global perspectives
Students get the chance to interact with people from all over the world in our comments section. These interactions might offer them a new perspective on a topic or challenge them to think differently.
This week, we saw many students from
Taipei, Taiwan
responding to American students on our prompt “
Have You Ever Felt Like an Outsider?
” For example,
Astrid Hagen
,
Avy
,
Regina Wu
,
Sarahlin
,
Kristen
and
Chen Yu Ping
all related their experiences of feeling like outsiders at their school to those of teenagers halfway across the world in North Carolina, Alabama and New Jersey.
Civil conversations
All of the comments that appear on our site are moderated by Learning Network editors. This gives students a unique opportunity to engage in civil conversations around tough topics.
This week, we saw respectful back-and-forth in a thread on our prompt “
What Is Hard About Being a Boy?
” from
Will Mason from Hoggard High School, Sabrina Mintz from Masterman, Philadelphia, Hope A from Masterman, Philly, Lily Sklaver from J.R Masterman School, Philadelphia, Samuel Hamilton from Masterman and Nico M. from J.R Masterman School, Philadelphia.
And we loved to see many other students from
J.R. Masterman School
, like
Anna Praticò
,
G Jap
,
Sivan Frankel
,
Tino K.
and
Ian Birley
, pushing back on and agreeing with specific points made by their fellow commenters.
Validation
By replying to and recommending each other’s comments, students get validation for their ideas, feelings and experiences from their peers.
Hsun from Taiwan
,
Hanna Sh from J.R. Masterman, Philadelphia, PA
, and
Kristina Kitsul from Masterman Philadelphia
are just a few of the students who gave that kind of affirmation to others this week.
Keep up the great work, everyone! We look forward to the conversations we get to read and call out next week.
Please note: All student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear as they were originally submitted.

In his Op-Ed, “
It’s Dangerous to Be a Boy
,” Michael C. Reichert writes about the unique challenges boys face, like violence against themselves and others. Their tendency toward aggression isn’t necessarily innate, he writes, but “rooted in boys’ socialization, which is characterized by physical discipline, control and disdain for weakness.”
In our
related Student Opinion question
, we asked students about the specific pressures boys face. Teenagers who identified as both boys and girls weighed in, sharing their honest experiences, observations and opinions about what it’s like to grow up as a boy in today’s world.
Suppressing your emotions
As a boy in our society, I know the expectations that are set for us. We are supposed to be emotionless, like rocks and we are told that we can’t express ourselves and that we should never show weakness in any form. I think that this is the reason that males are so competitive. This competitiveness causes insecurity and insecurity causes aggression and aggression causes health risks. In all, it’s one big slippery slope that leads to danger and that is the biggest problem, physical harm.

Ian Birley, Masterman Philadelphia
… Guys pretend we are big and strong and as if we don’t have any emotions but, some times I just want to break down and cry and say I’m done. Than I would be a quitter or some words my dad would say that I don’t think would be really good to put here in the comment section. Also I am an athlete in sports we are preform not only for ourselves or team or our school but for our family our last name because what we do or the actions we make reflect on our last name. So in conclusion just because we act like nothing is going on or we don’t get hurt guys also have many thoughts and emotions going through our minds.

Matthew Knotts, Oxford Mississippi
Being a guy is great, but sometimes it definitely sucks. Like having to put on masks to hide behind. It’s honestly exhausting sometimes to have to act different than you really are. And I’m sure that no one would even care if you acted like your true self but it’s something about us that doesn’t let us do it.

Will Carter, Hoggard Highschool, NC
Being encouraged to be violent
I am a boy, and I sometimes feel the pressure to be ¨tough¨ and ¨strong¨. I think the hardest thing about being a boy (this was mentioned in the article) is that you can never back down from a fight. For example, I once got into an argument about basketball and a person told me to stay away and not play, and several players that were already playing said ¨you´re going to take that?¨. I felt as if not standing up would make me seem weak.
—
Tino K., Masterman Philadelphia
During this day and age we have so many articles talking about the violence in men and boys and I think that’s the biggest problem nowadays. Men are often seen as violent and when you have tons of people believing that every man has a violent side to them than that starts out casting the men because believe it or not men do not want to hurt people. As a 6 ft 175 pound teenager I have been looked at weirdly and people often think that I could be violent when it’s the complete opposite. I simply don’t care when it comes to violence and I think a lot of other men stand with me when I say that the only time I ever even think of violence is when i’m in a threatening situation. It’s as simple as that.
—
Wyatt Young, Hoggard High School
Facing the pressure to conform
The hardest part about being a boy is the fact that we are told to be tough, play sports, and conceal our emotions. As a kid, I faced a lot of pressure from my Dad and society to conform. I ended up singing, acting, and playing in the marching band instead of conforming to the manly world of sports. I learned how to “be a man” from my Dad and just growing up with other males. I danced when I was younger, and got bullied during elementary school. This bullying and pressure made me quit something I love. Society expected I tackle a random kid in football, and instead I went and danced. I don’t know why breaking those norms isn’t celebrated …
Parents don’t understand that boys are just as emotional as girls. Boys still want to break down and cry, but society doesn’t promote that to be okay. I think it was harder to be a man during my parents time, and that’s why I have faced pressure to “be a man.” Parents need to find ways to cope with the fact that “being a man” is much less important than the happiness of their child. They should express themselves in any way they choose.

Society has many stereotypes, but the strongest stereotypes are for races and genders. Society has stereotypes, first, that there should only be two genders, although LGBTQIA people are gaining more acceptance by society, for all the time before that there was absolutely no acceptance for these people! The male stereotype is that all males should be strong, tough, play a sport, or multiple, and slightly violent, yet charming and handsome, as society does not accept “ugly” people either! In this day and age, males are stereotyped to enjoy video games as well, while females are not allowed to, by the stereotypes of society! If a male wants to do anything that is not within this stereotype, or not do something that is listed in the stereotype, they are severely punished by society by way of social isolation or social exclusion! This is why it is very hard to be unique in society, because unless it is popular, society will just push you out and pretend like you aren’t even there, and just carry on like normal. It is hard for anyone of any gender, race, religion, or ethnicity to uphold these societal norms, because they are so strict and have such a severe punishment!
—
Jason S., Philadelphia, PA, Masterman
I feel like the hardest thing about being a boy is dealing with people with more old fashion views and stereotypes. In the best case scenario, this would mean someone making a positive assumption about me. Unfortunately, this often ends up giving people negative and false assumptions. I also see this among younger people when they see I have some traits of a “stereotypical boy” and assume I, therefore, am a “stereotypical boy”. While I do some “stereotypical boy” things, I am annoyed by peoples assumptions that I do other “stereotypical boy” things.
Stereotypes are dark and dangerous things, this is because people are, for better or for worse, not like robots. Every person is different from everyone else in at least one way, this makes it impossible to find a mean of all humans. Stereotypes are failed attempts at finding a mean that often ends up offending people. All in all, stereotypes are people trying to create a being that describes everyone and failing because of how diverse human nature is.

Defending your point of view
When I first read this title, I was hesitant to write on this topic. I was hesitant to share my opinion on the matter because often times I find that my opinion is valued as lesser because of my privilege. I find that to be one of the most difficult things about being a white male in America because we are often told that our opinions do not matter. We cannot speak on controversial topics without first accepting some sort of fault or blame. I understand the great privilege that I have to be a white male and I get that I will never know what some others have to go through daily. But I try to. I try to be understanding of all and try to put myself in a position of support wherever necessary. However, I constantly feel that my support is not welcome because of who I am. It is discouraging to feel shunned by people who share political and social views as me, just because of the way I present. I know that I will never be able to change who I am, but my appearance is not all that defines me. I am understanding and caring and want to help others. It seems unfair to me that I am socially punished for things done generations ago by people whom I have no connection to other than gender and color of skin. I hate to even speak about this because I fear I am running the risk of sounding ignorant, and that is not what I want. I just find it frustrating that sexism is ignored if it is done on men.

Ezra, Lombardi
Embracing the positive aspects of masculinity
I feel that there are many trade-offs to being a man. The social norm for a man in almost every culture is to be the protector and provider. Men are the only ones to be conscripted into the military during times of crisis and also are expected to work to support their families. These are the responsibilities which are associated with manhood and, for the most part, are at the expense and not benefit of men …
Despite all of these things, I greatly appreciate my boyhood and, later, my manhood, as these things which we call responsibilities appeal to me. I would feel proud to be a father, husband, and working man for my family. I would also be glad to serve in the military for my country. I enjoy what some people consider “rough-and-tumble guy activities”. So, from a personal perspective, the things which some may consider as “derogatory stereotypes” are the very same things which I embrace as part of my identity as a guy.
—
Andrei Mistreanu, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, NC
Since the beginning of time, masculinity has been a part of our society and has been expected from our men. They have been our protectors and fighters and risked their lives to save their families. So why are questioning masculinity now? Isn’t it something we can’t change and men should deal with the struggles that everyone goes through?
Every human on this earth goes through troubles, whether it be with money, friends, family, or themselves. Both male and females deal with social structures in life and can never escape them. Men should do what they want and not be told by other people whether they’re too feminine or masculine. They also shouldn’t be scrutinized for just being a man; they naturally have more testosterone and will act out in fights or by driving aggressively. By saying that anyone won’t act out naturally is like saying that people won’t be sad, happy, or jealous.
If men just stop being men, the world would be ruined. We have men and women for a reason, and both of their roles in society are crucial. By saying one should change to act more like the other is counter-intuitive.
The Romans didn’t take over Gaul or Germania by talking their way out of it. We sometimes do need force and strength, despite common belief. We’re going to have another war someday, and we’ll need strong-minded people to fight in it.

I really do not think that being a guy is as hard as being a girl in society as of right now. We don’t have to worry about having a good body and aren’t looked down upon for being “perfect”. I will say that being a guy you are not supposed to open up about anything and should keep everything to yourself. I think a good thing about being a man though is that we are born with respect and don’t necessarily need to work as hard as women as we are born more physically advanced … Overall it is a lot easier to be a man in our society now as we don’t have to work as hard for what we want and don’t have to try to be someone that we aren’t.

Girls reflecting on the hardships boys face
As an older sister, I have observed that my younger brother is constantly encouraged to be interested in toy guns or sports and met with a disapproving look if he speaks about participating in the arts or a more traditionally “feminine” activity. When my sisters and I were younger we were encouraged to participate on whatever we set our minds on; whether that be sports, music, or science. The world was ours for the taking. In elementary schools we were described as either Tom Boys or Girly Girls or something in between, but for many of my young male friends they were either boys or wimps.

I am a girl so I don’t personally know the struggles of a boy but from what I have witnessed, there is a struggle with gender bias/gender image and trying to fit in...My brother was made fun of because he played ping pong instead of basketball. He said he would rather do something he was good at then get hurt playing a sport he was only slightly interested in. He didn’t really care what others were saying about him (calling him a nerd, etc), but this goes to show the stereotypes we still have today. Yes, we have come a long way from the past but there is still much room for improvement towards how society views gender roles and each other.

I have never felt the need to pretend to be another person around my friends, but I observe that my brother does. He also doesn’t talk to his friends about matters of the soul, which is emotionally stunting. I will never pretend that boys’ relative incapacity for deep friendships is in any way equivalent to the systematic abuse girls face, even today. But it is a problem that will harm them in the long run, and ultimately make their lives less meaningful.

I believe that there area lot of hard things about being a boy, through i am not one myself. Some of the difficult things about being a boy is the stigma around you showing emotions, if a boy cries he is called “Too sensitive”, but if he shows no emotions at all he is called “Too scary, psychopathic, and you should be more sensitive.”...Not only that but if a male is in an abusive relationship whether it me physically, or emotionally he just has to take it, and he the male does fight back for self protection he is the villain.

Both boys and girls just have a lot of problems. If you are a boy and you do the right thing, your a goodie goodie. You do the wrong thing, and nobody likes you because your “bad.” Boys also feel the pressure to have a deep, manly voice when they are in middle school and still talk like munchkins. Now even though boys have it hard, girls have it way harder. So much of my time is spent on shopping, showering, moisturizing, outfit planning, putting make up on, doing my hair, and trying to be this perfectly groomed barbie that people expect me to be. All of my money is spent on beauty products and whatever will make me more confident. Most girls have confidence issues. We all think we are fat and are constantly on weird diets and cleanses just trying to lose a couple pounds. In conclusion, everyone is going through something tough, Life is hard and we should all learn to respect each other and our challenges.

Last week, The Times reported a story about a woman who, due to a rare genetic mutation,
has never experienced pain or anxiety
.
We asked students
: Would they want to live such a life? How might their lives be different without any pain — physical or psychological? Has pain ever been beneficial to them?
Most students said no, they would not want to live a pain-free existence and we appreciated the robust reasoning they used to support their opinions. Below, they tell us about the many roles pain has played in their lives — from signaling danger and teaching them hard lessons to helping them appreciate the good things in life.
The necessity of physical pain
Life without pain might sound like a cool superpower simply because without pain you feel invincible and nothing can hurt you but, there are serious threats to your body that could be present and you would never know. Lets say you were cooking and watching tv, and you lean on the counter, after a few minutes you notice that you have a 3rd degree burn. Listen, pain is an excellent teacher, it helps us learn and adapt to our surroundings, and plus feeling anything is one of our primary senses. Pain is necessary.
—
Sincere, Homewood
Pain is a part of life. You can’t learn without experience the pain of struggle or fear. In a life without fear, I wouldn’t trust myself. There would be nothing holding me back and I wouldn’t know when to stop. I would end up in situations that could endanger myself and others.
—
DeAundre G., Booker High School
Pain is something people have to learn in order to know the dangers of different things. Pain can be very hard but we still have to go through it physically and emotionally in order to grow and learn. I think if I didn’t have pain my life would be different because then I wouldn’t know the dangers of a lot of stuff and would never learn pain.
—
Alexis, Caruthers
The benefits of emotional pain
Not feeling pain sounds like a pretty good life, but I don’t think I would want it. I feel as though you need to feel pain in life in order to get stronger. Sometimes it’s good to be scared or have anxiety. It can also be fun being scared like when you’re on a roller coaster or going through a haunted house. I would definitely be happy if some of my pain in life was relieved, but pain only helps me in the end. Personally I wouldn’t want to live a life without pain. Pain is a part of life and I want to experience life at its fullest.

… She can’t feel emotional pain. At first, that sounds good, but you wouldn’t ever be able to people. It would give you an incredible lack of empathy.
—
Stella Wilkins, Oxford Middle School
A life without struggle is no life at all
I think that a life without hardships is almost meaningless. Both emotional and physical pain are very important in one’s growth and maturity. Yes it would be nice to be able to do whatever you want knowing you wouldn’t get hurt in the end but pain is essential to human sympathy and teaches you things that would otherwise be unknown to you. In conclusion, I don’t believe that a life without pain or sadness in it could truly be a happy one.

Pain and anxiety is what drives us to persevere through the hard times in life. We would have never been able to walk had we not fallen down and felt the pain of failure. We would have never learned how to ride a bike if we hadn’t fallen and felt the anxiety of getting back up and trying again. We would have never found our true love if it wasn’t for our countless heartbreaks prior. This process repeats itself throughout the entirety of our lives. Pain and failure is what motivates us to be better, and without it we would have no drive to excel.
—
Elodie Poussard, Massachusetts
I think pain ,both mental and physical, is essential to growth as an individual. Without pain you would never truly be able to appreciate the positive feelings. A life without pain would be bland, it would be tasteless and uneventful. Heartbreak and mental toll has been whats shaped me into the person I am. Struggle builds character, and mental strength. Hurt is like a vaccine, immunizing you for future devastation. I truly feel sorry for the woman in the article, a woman that will never get to experience the bittersweet taste of pain.

Appreciating the highs and lows of life
Pain is necessary to enjoy life to the fullest, and experience emotions intensely. In my opinion, the good parts of life would not be as enjoyable if we did not experience pain prior to them. A clear, sunny day is always valued more when it follows a week of rain and gloom. In a similar way, I always feel more appreciative of my good health in the days that I recover from sickness. In life, there will be highs and lows, good and bad. It is important to remember the times of struggle and suffering to value the good and beautiful aspects of life.
—
Avery Purtell, Danvers MA
Life without pain would be a tough life to live. Pain makes the good moments that much better. And if there is no pain, then is there good? Or is everything just neutral? As much as pain hurts, at least you know that you are real, alive, and can feel something.
—
Trey Clucas, Hoggard High School
I can’t imagine how nice it would be to live without pain. Without fear, anxiety or depression. Oh how nice it would be to eat one of those Scotch Bonnet chili peppers and only feel a “pleasant glow”. But while reading this article, a song was repeating in my head.“100 Bad Days”, by AJR. I even took a second to bob my head to the chorus, “100 bad days makes 100 good stories …” and I began to think, without pain, can you even have a bad day? And if you never have a bad day, what is your story? Now I think living in a world without pain is like living blind. It’s like how without darkness, you would forget to appreciate the light. And if you get lost in the darkness, you have to find your way out, and from that journey you have to find strength and that struggle makes you who you are.

No pain, no problems
… I think that losing all pain would be well worth it for me. A painless life would be so much easier. I’d make sure to briefly check my body every night, and thoroughly once a week. That way I could ensure that if anything is wrong I could check in with a doctor. As for emotional pain, that would truly give someone a great life. With no anxiety, every aspect of life becomes easier. No more stressing about, tests, auditions, or performances. Without anxiety, the overwhelming majority of stress would completely diminish. This sounds extremely appealing and I feel that life would be overall much easier. A life without pain would be almost entirely beneficial, and I would definitely take that option if made available.

Mike Mahoney, MA
I would want to live life without feeling pain. Some of the advantages of life without pain would be amazing. Not only that but no psychological pain would be amazing with anxiety and depression. If I lived life without pain my life would 100% be different. I would be so much happier than I am right now. I would be doing so much other stuff than just the usual stuff that I do. I would for sure choose pain free over adrenaline rush in my life.
—
Juan, Alabama
If we could live without pain It would be a whole different experience of the world and life. The reason I say this is because if we didn’t have pain we would be more happier and the things that made us sad or cause depression would of been a different thing with a greater situation. There would also not be so much suicide or overdose people going on.

In celebration of the season, we asked students in our Picture Prompt, “
Signs of Spring
,” what sights, sounds, smells and feelings tell them the seasons are changing in their neighborhoods. We loved the vivid imagery they used to describe the budding plants, warm temperatures and feelings of change that
signal the coming of spring
where they live.
April showers and May flowers
I fully believe that April showers do bring May flowers but the rain is just as beautiful as the greenery that Earth so kindly shares with us. With the temperature being welcoming, time spent outside is more gratifying. Walking in the open air rejuvenates my body when the smells of flowers coming to life overcome my senses. Nothing can bring me more joy than knowing the bees and butterflies are peacefully working hard to keep this planet absolutely stunning.
Living in a small Jersey Shore town our springtime is the calm before the chaos. It is when I get to fully enjoy my hometown because when the town of Point Pleasant is almost overflowing in the summer, I can not immerse myself in it’s small yet meaningful beauties.

The flowers start to bloom, and yard (that you different have to cut all winter) starts growing again, and the pollen begins to form in the air like fog. The pollen is a big sign of spring because you will go outside and your black car will be yellow, which means your allergies will begin to start acting up for those two or three weeks you when have to keep blowing your nose constantly.
—
Ryan Moore, Hoggard High School
Because I’m from North Carolina, the beginning of spring is clearly expressed through the arrival of blooming azaleas. Personally, I don’t really pay attention to the plants in my yard and others around my neighborhood, but every year, as soon as they bloom, I notice the azaleas all over my yard and around my neighborhood, which I didn’t notice before. I love seeing the different colors of azaleas people have, and if they match the houses or not. Spring is a really beautiful time where I live …
Spring is something else; everything gets brighter and prettier, the weather gets warmer, and summer gets closer. I used to not like spring because it was too “inbetween,” but as I get older I begin to appreciate it more.

Warm-weather activities
One word. Fishing. Since I live on the Jersey Shore, I love to be on the water and go fishing. With the warmer weather falling down upon us and the beginning of April, I know, Spring is here. This upcoming Saturday is the opening day for trout fishing. Trout are usually the first fish I am able to fish for during the new year. So this Saturday, over a hundred anglers line up on the edge of Spring Lake, all waiting for their chance to catch some trout.

Spring is the best time of the year, especially when you live a mile away from the beach. The weather is perfect — warm and sunny but not humid yet, and you no longer need a jacket to leave the house. Personally, I find the winter weather to be miserable and I would rather stay in my house than face the cold. I think a lot of people agree with me, because as soon as the temperature rises above sixty five degrees, it seems as if the whole town is out.
But that is also what I love about spring. The warmer weather brings our town together when everybody is out interacting with each other, instead of sitting inside their own homes. Spring is something to look forward to because this means it is finally time to go to the beach again. It is time for all of the birds to start waking up the neighborhood again with their chirping and to finally be able to open up the windows in your house and car, just enjoy the fresh air. Overall, spring is a sign of happiness for me, and that is why it is something to look forward to.
—
Madi Ranges, Point Pleasant NJ
I always look forward to the arrival of spring. Spring means new beginnings, a fresh new season of opportunity. For me specifically, every year as the leaves turn back to green and pollen begins to stick to cars, it means one step closer to summer. The air turns warmer, the breeze cooler, and the sun shines brighter than it has in months. You get to shed the heavy winter coats and boots and put on a pair of shorts and flip flops. Living close to the beach, spring means the beginning of long awaited beach trips and boat rides for my friends and I. The anticipation and lead up to summer is the reason I will always look forward to spring.

Rebirth, change and new beginnings
There are so many ways to see that it is becoming spring in my hometown. The warm sun beats down and turns my skin a nice, golden brown. The birds begin chirping loudly in the mornings earlier and earlier. The flowers that I planted last fall begin to bloom in a rainbow of colors. I always look forward to the arrival of spring. Spring is rebirth. For everyone and everything. It’s a nice breath of fresh air after a long, dead winter.
—
Lilly Eubanks, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, NC
Living in New England, we’re usually treated to last minute snowfall well after the vernal equinox. Still, I know Spring is coming when my parakeets begin to chirp incessantly, all day long. I also love seeing purple crocuses emerge from the ground outside my house- I never see them in such high quantities anywhere else.
This year I’m more anxious about the progression of Winter into Spring and Spring into Summer, though, because my junior year of high school has passed so quickly that it’s overwhelming, and soon my senior friends will be leaving and I’ll have to make college decisions. Hopefully Spring will last for a while.

CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — Sylvia Hatchell, the University of North Carolina women’s basketball coach, used to preach about “the fishbowl.”
“You’re always in the fishbowl,” Hatchell would tell players like Tonya Sampson, a former player who recalled the admonitions in an interview on Friday. “You never know who’s watching. You’ve always got to carry yourself with integrity and the best way you can.”
Twenty-five years after Hatchell and Sampson won a national title for North Carolina, Hatchell’s reputation is in peril and her team is in turmoil. U.N.C. officials, who were told late last month about three episodes that some players thought revealed Hatchell to be
racially insensitive and aloof
, placed her and her assistants on paid administrative leave and opened a storied program to abrupt scrutiny.
An outside law firm is investigating. Several U.N.C. players are considering transferring. And Hatchell, 67, one of women’s basketball’s most successful and influential coaches and a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, is not talking beyond a single written statement.
It seems no one, from high-ranking state lawmakers to parents of players, is certain whether she will coach again at U.N.C., a Southern powerhouse of athletics and academics that has spent years grappling with issues of race. Hatchell’s lawyer, Wade M. Smith, could only say, “I hope she does come back.”
The allegations against Hatchell, privately detailed to university officials on March 28 and in news media accounts in the week that followed, represent a grave test to her 33-year tenure at U.N.C., where she is under contract for just one more season. And although the just-concluded season was modestly more successful than other recent campaigns, Hatchell has lately led a program that felt removed from the one that, not long ago, routinely won at least 25 games a year.
This year, in its first appearance in the N.C.A.A. women’s basketball tournament since the 2014-15 season, U.N.C. (18-15) exited in the first round with a 20-point
loss to California.
Hatchell’s critics have been reluctant to speak publicly, in part, they said, because they fear retaliation. After so many years, Hatchell has become an institution at U.N.C., not quite on par with Dean Smith, the revered former men’s coach, but not far off. Many current and former players did not respond to messages, but some who did expressed support for Hatchell, even as they depicted her as a coach of searing, drawling intensity.
The university said it had hired a Charlotte law firm to “assess the culture of the women’s basketball program and the experience of our student-athletes.” Officials have declined to comment beyond that.
The law firm is expected to examine the quality of medical care for players and whether Hatchell had warned her team that “nooses” would await them if they turned in a poor performance against Louisville. U.N.C. officials were also told that Hatchell had urged her players to perform a “tomahawk chop” war cry to fire them up — a suggestion the women resisted — and that she had described players as “old mules.” Some people perceived the comment as a reference to female slaves.
Smith, Hatchell’s lawyer, said the coach “doesn’t have a racist bone in her body.”
He said some players had misconstrued Hatchell’s words, but he acknowledged that she had apologized after an internal uproar about the episode in which people recalled that she had referred to nooses.
“She said words like, ‘They’re going to hang us out to dry. They’re going to take a rope and hang us out to dry,’” Smith said. He added that Hatchell, who did not believe she had said anything improper, initially apologized by saying something like, “I’m sorry you took it that way.”
“The team did not see that as an apology,” Smith said. “I think she thought she apologized.”
But a furor still built, and the university, whose trustees declined to comment or did not respond to messages, will soon have to decide the fate of the coach, who cultivated the modern women’s game and has been known more for her fiery courtside coaching than personal controversy.
“I never encountered any kind of racial slurs or racism,” said Nikki Teasley, a former U.N.C. point guard who went on to a long career in the W.N.B.A. “My experience with Coach Hatchell was very heartfelt, very loving, very kind.”
Teasley, who is African-American, said she did not recall any racially improper comments but did say Hatchell was fierce and demanding.
“After playing and then becoming a coach myself and then a mother,” she said, “you understand that sometimes things do get overheated, and in the heat of the moment you do say some things.”
Hatchell grew up in Gastonia, N.C., a small city 20 miles west of Charlotte, and graduated from a public high school that had only recently integrated. Judge Jesse B. Caldwell III, who graduated from Hunter Huss High School a few years ahead of Hatchell, recalled little friction over integration in the area. Basketball, he said, helped bring people together. At nearby Ashley High School, an integrated team
won a state championship
in 1967.
Hatchell’s school did not have a women’s basketball team when she was a student. She began coaching as an undergraduate, and she took control of the North Carolina program, already an emerging incubator of basketball players, in 1986.
She became known as a skilled recruiter and drew some of the nation’s top basketball talent to Chapel Hill. Yet to people in and around her program, Hatchell sometimes seemed to be more of a chief executive than a coach. Andrew Calder, a Hatchell deputy since her arrival at U.N.C., was often credited with developing players.
“I learned the game through Coach Calder,” Sampson said. “You knew who the head coach was, but hands-on, no, she wasn’t hands-on when I was there.”
To a point, the formula worked. Lifted by a 3-point shot as time expired, the Tar Heels
won their only women’s basketball title
in 1994. Including that season, the Tar Heels have reached the Final Four three times — far less than programs like Connecticut, Tennessee and
Notre Dame
.
At their best, Hatchell’s teams played with an attractive, fast-paced style that relied on fast breaks and smart point-guard play. This season she continued
to tout
her up-tempo offense.
Hatchell’s stature has grown in a state where college basketball is prized. She missed one season, in 2013-14, for cancer treatment, but the next season North Carolina went 26-9 and finished with a No. 9 ranking.
Hatchell’s comeback era came as U.N.C. wrestled with an academic fraud scandal that reached into the women’s basketball program. Although the university was not punished, years of bad headlines, investigations and speculation took a toll. Some players cited the scandal when they chose to transfer elsewhere.
Hatchell, though, remained and, in 2016, received a contract extension. Last year, she signed a deal with Nike: $150,000 for up to four personal appearances a year until 2028. (The contract ends early if Hatchell leaves as head coach.)
Beyond basketball, Hatchell’s Christian faith has long been central to her life and her public persona. More than a decade ago, she started a women’s Bible study in the Chapel Hill area. For the last six years, the teacher has been Rachel-Ruth Wright, a granddaughter of Billy Graham, the North Carolina evangelist.
“I’ve never heard her say one negative thing about any of her players,” Ms. Wright said. “She’s always positive, always excited. She’s just an encouragement all the time.”
The university’s investigation might answer if she went too far in doing so. The Charlotte Observer this week published
a scathing editorial
about the conduct of college coaches.
“Other women’s basketball programs, including Georgia Tech, have fired coaches in recent years for mistreating players,” the paper, among the state’s most widely read, wrote. “If U.N.C. finds abuse from any coach — men’s or women’s — it should do the same.”
Weeks ago, Hatchell appeared in high spirits at a commemoration of U.N.C.’s only national title.
Hatchell visited a pregame lunch for members of that 1994 championship team, who were later honored on the court.
“She hugged me. ‘Glad to see you’ kind of thing,” Sampson said. “Then she was off, because she had to get prepared for the game.”

As federal prosecutors on Tuesday brought new money laundering charges against 16 parents enmeshed in the college admissions scandal, a question hung over the sprawling case: Would anybody implicated in the scam actually serve time behind bars?
The Hollywood actress Lori Loughlin and her husband, the designer Mossimo Giannulli, were among those indicted on a count of conspiracy to commit fraud and another of money laundering conspiracy, raising the legal stakes for parents who have not said whether they would plead guilty in the case.
But it was a wide open question, legal experts and former prosecutors said, as to what price celebrities, business executives and other boldface names may end up paying if they are convicted in the largest-ever admissions prosecution.
“This is somewhat uncharted waters because this is a really unique case — we haven’t seen a case where dozens of parents are being hauled off into court before,” said Bradley Simon, a former federal prosecutor who now leads the white-collar defense practice at Phillips Nizer, a law firm based in New York.
Prosecutors have charged a total of 50 people, including the college consultant at the center of the scandal, William Singer, who has already pleaded guilty to racketeering and other charges. Thirty-three parents are accused of paying Mr. Singer to arrange for cheating on entrance exams or conspiring with him to bribe coaches or athletic officials to get their children admitted to colleges as recruits to sports teams, on the basis of fake credentials.
On Monday, prosecutors said that
13 of the parents, including the actress Felicity Huffman
, would plead guilty. In all but one case, those parents will plead guilty to a single count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest service mail fraud. Then on Tuesday came indictments, including new counts, against many of the parents who had not announced plans to enter guilty pleas.
Vassili Thomadakis, a former assistant United States attorney in the district of Massachusetts, said Mr. Singer would almost certainly be sent to prison for some period of time, even though he has cooperated with the investigation, including making recorded phone calls to parents at investigators’ request. Mr. Thomadakis said it was also likely that any coaches or administrators who were convicted would face prison time, perhaps for a matter of months or a few years.
Less clear, it seemed, was what might happen to any parents convicted in the case.
Former prosecutors said that might depend on an array of matters. How much did the parents spend on the scheme to get their child into college? Did they opt to plead guilty? Did they fight the charges through a trial, but get convicted anyway? Did they cooperate with the authorities?
“For folks who have these kind of the bigger payments that you see in the indictment, I think that they certainly face some prison time, especially if they take the case to trial and lose,” Mr. Thomadakis said. Mr. Thomadakis said that prosecutors are likely to argue that a sentence of some prison time is necessary to dissuade other parents eager to do anything to help their children get into college from engaging in similar behavior.
If convicted, those accused of paying some of the largest sums — some families are accused of paying as much as $500,000 in bribes to get their children into schools — might be penalized most harshly.
Courtney Oliva, executive director of the Center on the Administration of Criminal Law at New York University and a former federal prosecutor, said that Ms. Huffman, who apologized this week for her role in the case and said she would plead guilty, most likely faces a short prison sentence or might avoid prison time altogether, serving most or all of a penalty through a home confinement or probation. Ms. Huffman acknowledged having paid Mr. Singer $15,000 to arrange for cheating on her daughter’s SAT exam.
“I personally think it would be crazy to send her to prison,” Ms. Oliva said.
Mr. Simon, the former federal prosecutor, noted that Ms. Huffman and Gordon Caplan, another parent
who has said he would plead guilty
, each issued long statements expressing remorse.
“Those were long and seemingly sincere statements of contrition,” Mr. Simon said. “If I were a judge, that would go a long way to ensure they don’t get jail.”
On the other hand, Mr. Simon said, intense publicity around the case could create pressure to impose some prison time.
“Judges and prosecutors are always very sensitive to the court of public opinion in determining what sentences they get,” Mr. Simon said. “They will feel some pressure to send a message. A lot of people are really horrified by this. It undermines the system. It smacks of breathtaking self-entitlement.”
Lawyers for defendants pleading guilty may argue that the harm their clients have suffered to their reputations, and the professional and other consequences of pleading guilty to a felony, provide enough of a deterrent.
Representatives for some parents have said that they intend to fight the charges, and are eagerly awaiting their chance to give their side of the story in court.
Among the parents indicted on Tuesday was William McGlashan, a major Silicon Valley investor, who is accused of paying Mr. Singer $50,000 for cheating on his son’s ACT and of agreeing to pay $250,000 to get his son admitted to the University of Southern California as a football recruit, although prosecutors say Mr. McGlashan did not ultimately go through with that scheme.
“The prosecutor’s case against Mr. McGlashan is deeply flawed and ignores important exculpatory facts,” one of Mr. McGlashan’s lawyers, John Hueston, said. “We look forward to presenting his side of the story.”
David Schumacher, who represents Gregory and Amy Colburn, parents who are accused of arranging for cheating on the SAT, said that his clients were innocent of the charges. “They’re looking forward to asserting their rights under the Constitution and under the federal rules to a speedy trial so they can clear their good names,” Mr. Schumacher said.

MANILA — Bracing for life after Brexit, British hospitals badly need more nurses like Filipino Jobie Escalona, but she twice flunked a mandatory English language test that asked her to write up the merits of immigration and computer education in school.
The 23-year-old Escalona, with three years experience in a private hospital in Manila, lost almost 3 months salary paying nearly $600 to sit the tests.
Fed up, she was ready to give up on Britain and try Canada, one of several other countries short of nurses, until her father persuaded her to take the test a third time.
""I was already losing hope,"" she told Reuters. Finally, in January last year, she passed, having at last got a subject she felt comfortable writing about in the tough written section of the test.
Asked to compare team and individual sports, Escalona had little trouble: ""I was able to relate to it because I am a swimmer.""
But, her tortuous experience doesn't bode well for Britain's chances of adequately filling alarming staffing gaps in its healthcare services.
With Brexit looming, the supply of nurses from European Union countries has almost dried up, with lots going home. And of the many foreign nationalities employed in Britain, Filipinos made up the largest number, with 10,719, according to a parliamentary paper.
As of June last year, 16 percent of nursing jobs in hospitals and community health services were held by foreigners - nearly a quarter of whom were Filipinos.
Britain is already facing a shortage of 40,000 nurses, and once it leaves the EU, if it ever happens, the gap could widen to 50,000, enough to staff more than 40 small to medium-sized hospitals, according to a report commissioned by the Cavendish Coalition, a group of health and social care organizations.
OUT OF THEIR COMFORT ZONE
The staffing crisis is increasing Britain's dependency on hiring from low cost countries like India and the Philippines, where English is widely spoken, yet the language test has proved to be a major obstacle.
Philippine recruitment firm Louis International Manpower Services has received 1,000 job orders for nurses since 2015.
It has only filled a quarter of them.
""It is not because of the lack of applications, but the English test,"" said Lilibeth Villas, documentation officer at the firm. ""We have applicants who were interviewed in 2015, but they have not passed the test yet.""
Run by the British Council, IDP Education and Cambridge Assessment, the International English Language Test System (IELTS) gauges applicants' ability to speak, listen, read and write, and is used by employers around the world.
Questions in the academic written section asks candidates to write short essays on diverse subjects. Examples given on the IELTS website included interpreting graphs on changes in radio and television audiences, and gender variations between full and part-time students, and discussing the pros and cons of nuclear technology and of regulating car ownership.
Many candidates clearly find the weighty topics too daunting.
Febin Cyriac, a business development manager at Envertiz Consultancy, a British healthcare recruitment firm that specializes in bringing in nurses from overseas, started a petition in change.org in 2014 that asked UK regulators to relax their IELTS scores.
Working as a nurse himself, Cyriac said there are a good number of Indian or Filipino nurses with many years of experience working in Britain, but who are only working as assistant nurses in the National Health Service (NHS) and nursing homes.
""IELTS is the only barrier for them to practice as a nurse in the UK,"" said Cyriac, himself a nurse working in Britain.
Still, the number of Filipinos in the NHS has risen by almost a third in the last two years, according to British government figures.
Late last year, the pass mark for the writing section was lowered, but there are no immediate plans to make further changes to the test standards, said Andrea Sutcliffe, Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) Chief Executive and Registrar.
""We will continue to carefully monitor the impact of the recent changes. This change is part of a wider review of our overseas registration processes aimed at making it more straightforward and user-friendly for people with the right skills and knowledge to join our register in a timely way"", Sutcliffe said.
There is an Occupational English Test (OET), more suited to medical professionals, that foreign nurses can take. If they pass that test they would still have to sit the IELTS, but they would be eligible for a lower pass mark. The OET is more expensive, however, making it unattractive for low paid nurses.
A London-based recruitment agency visited Manila recently to find nurses for Cambridge University, East Surrey and Royal Cornwall Hospitals, while there have also been recent hiring drives for hospital trusts in Oxford, Hull and Dudley.
Germany, Japan, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia are the other countries hiring Filipino nurses, said Bernard Olalia, head of the government's Philippine Overseas Employment Administration.
In January alone, Olalia's office received 1,000 job orders for nurses from Saudi Arabia.
""There are a lot of markets for our Filipino nurses,"" Olalia said, adding that it was understandable if they took jobs in places where the requirements were easier to fulfill.
Filipino nurses who were recruited in the 1990s did not have to take the language tests, yet they are still in the NHS and providing good service, said Reydeluz Conferido, who was until recently the labor attache to the Philippines embassy in London.
While there, Conferido called on British officials to review the requirements placed on overseas nurses to see whether they were serving the correct purpose or creating an artificial barrier.
""If you really want these nurses, you would do something about your standards,"" he said.

Good evening. Here’s the latest.
1. A purge at the Department of Homeland Security.
A day after pushing out the secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen,
President Trump moved to sweep out others
in the department’s top ranks: the head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the Secret Service director and the department’s general counsel.
Mr. Trump has been pushing for even harsher border policies than Ms. Nielsen presided over, and
to resume separating families
. Above, Central American migrants turned themselves in at the border in Texas on Saturday.
And his scrutiny of the Secret Service appears to have risen since agents arrested a Chinese woman over a week ago at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort. More details about that case came out
at a court hearing today

2. On the eve of Israeli elections,
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, above campaigning today, reached out to Israel’s right with a pledge that could end any possibility of a two-state solution.
Facing the surging appeal of the former army chief Benny Gantz, Mr. Netanyahu promised that if re-elected, he would
begin asserting Israeli sovereignty over areas of the West Bank
.
Mr. Netanyahu also may have received a last-minute boost from President Trump, who
designated Iran’s Revolutionary Guard a terrorist group

The end of senior year is now often characterized by a sense of purposelessness. Here are five ways high school seniors can connect with what matters to them.
By
Ned Johnson
As most college-bound high school seniors learn where they’ve gotten in and decide where they’re going, many feel that the pressure is off. Whether they are celebrating acceptances to their dream schools or coping with rejections, nearly all realize at this point that the die has been cast: The push for high school grades that used to drive everything suddenly matters much less.
“Senioritis” used to have positive connotations for students. It meant coasting through their last semester in high school in anticipation of college entry in the fall. Today that mood has shifted. Many students — and their parents — have been driven to believe that high school is merely a four-year audition for the right college. A result? Eighteen-year-olds who feel their lives are not really driven by them.
Rather than being a time of freedom, the new senioritis is characterized by a sense of purposelessness.
Without an external motivator (reward of college admission or threat of college denial), far too many students have little idea of what to do or why.
Psychologists use the terms “external” versus “internal” control, which is
the sense that someone other than the individual is responsible for his success or failure
. School, and especially the college admissions process, very much fosters this tendency. Students look to teachers and parents for cues to what matters and try to imagine what they need to do to meet the approval of admissions officials. It’s a far cry from reflecting on a more pressing question: “What matters to me?”
It is common for many students, when denied admission to their dream college, to lament that “it’s not fair” or that they’ve “wasted all of this effort,” as though their work as students in high school and their aspirations for college were merely transactional rather than part of their development as learners and, more so, as people. In the aftermath of a rejection, more students than I can count have told me they should have gone to an easier high school or taken easier (or harder) classes, taken more or fewer AP classes, or should have dropped sports, music or debate “to get better grades.”
Typically in this situation, students and their parents cast about for some path or reason that would have delivered the result they wished for. They rarely reflect on the possibility that the sport, class or activity they engaged in may pay off down the road in other ways, through a talent developed or interest kindled. Many of these kids feel that the whole point of working hard in high school is so they can get in to an even harder college, then move on to a future that they know little more about than that it will be hard-charging. It is easy to understand how painfully the rejection hits, since the process has all been framed around the outcome.
In the second semester of senior year, students are still engaged with the same people and activities of the last four years, but the terms, pressures and motivations have changed.
For the next few months, the rules are very different. Teachers and parents complain that they can’t get teenagers to do anything. Some have even
proposed eliminating
senior year.
But I see the end of senior year as an opportunity for kids to figure out their inner motivation, post college acceptance.
For kids who have been grinding for too long, the second semester can be downtime to recharge. But I also encourage students to use this time with intention, as it will help them enormously to be in touch with what matters to them. They can make themselves their senior project. Here are some suggestions.
Go deep into things that matter to you, especially what you didn’t have time for or seemed “unimportant” for college admissions. A senior I know who hopes to study medicine used her second semester to train as an EMT. It was a great way to see firsthand whether medicine appealed at a boots-on-the-ground level and whether she was really suited to the field. It also ended up being a well-paying part-time job.
Learn how to run your own life. Make a list of adult or college skills you don’t know how to do, like automobile maintenance or cooking. I’ve heard of college kids, clueless as to basic kitchen skills, turning to YouTube videos to learn how to make hot dogs. If you haven’t yet learned to drive, that’s a skill that also belongs on this list. There are real upsides to Uber, but it isn’t yet everywhere. And you may face a situation where a friend is unfit to drive and someone needs to step up.
Try looking for a part-time job — on your own. I was visiting a friend’s business recently when he picked up the phone. It was someone calling to confirm the time of a job interview for a recent college grad named Ben. The caller was Ben’s mom. My friend said, “Well, please tell Ben his interview is canceled and that he should have called himself.”
Like anything that matters, learning how to enter, manage and (when necessary) exit relationships benefits from experience. A
2017 study in Child Development
found that young people today are less likely to have dated than young people did during the ’90s; perhaps they are more focused on passing classes than passing notes. According to the
General Social Survey
,
more than half of young adults
, aged 18 to 34, do not have a steady romantic partner. A
2013 New York Times piece
recounted the “hookup culture” at Ivy League universities, where students shared views like “A relationship is like taking a four-credit class,” or “I could get in a relationship, or I could finish my film.”
A friend who has been an independent college counselor for decades wistfully observes that “Nobody believes me when I tell them, but who you marry will matter much more than where you go to college.” If the first seven semesters of high school were college prep, perhaps let the last one be more about relationship prep.
Go technology-free for a week — or even a day. Digital downtime is a challenge but can also be an awakening as to the ways that technology impacts our
thought processes and ability to pay attention
— a recognition students can take to college and beyond. And, while many believe college is where they will develop a coherent sense of self, it can only help to begin that process in senior year.

BUFFALO, N.Y. — Coach Scott Sandelin isn't taking Minnesota Duluth's third consecutive trip to the Frozen Four championship game for granted because of how difficult it is to get there.
It wasn't easy for the Bulldogs once again in pulling out a 4-1 victory over Providence in a tightly contested game they sealed by scoring two empty-net goals in the final 33 seconds Thursday night. They will face Massachusetts in the final. The Minutemen beat Denver 4-3 in overtime in the second semifinal.
Minnesota Duluth (28-11-2) overcame having two goals disallowed in the first period and then killed off the Friars' two-man-advantage in the third period, some three minutes before Billy Exell scored the go-ahead goal with 9:53 left.
""I was nervous as hell when they got the 5-on-3, the way their power play was,"" Sandelin said. ""To be able to do that at that time of the game was a big-time moment. Those are changing, turning points in games. Whether we went on to win that, I was just thrilled to get out of their still tied.""
Justin Richards scored twice, including an empty-netter, and Dylan Samberg also scored for Minnesota Duluth. The Bulldogs are attempting to become the first team to win consecutive titles since Denver in 2004-05.
Hunter Shepard stopped 28 shots and improved his NCAA Tournament career record to 7-0.
The National Collegiate Hockey Conference champion Bulldogs also became the first team to reach three consecutive championship games since Boston College from 2006-08. Minnesota Duluth lost 3-2 to Denver in the 2017 championship game.
Providence (24-12-6) was denied an opportunity to reach its first championship game since 2015, when the Friars beat Boston University 4-3 to win their first title. Josh Wilkins scored for Providence and Hayden Hawkey stopped 32 shots.
Sandelin credited the Bulldogs for leaning on their past experience playing on a big stage.
""Our group has been in a lot of tough games, they've been in big games. And they've learned how to win some of those games,"" said Sandelin, who became the ninth coach to reach the championship game four times. ""It's never easy. It doesn't always happen right away. This group, sometimes I didn't know if it was there. But they've really proven it here when it's crunch time.""
Exell's goal was just the senior's third of the season.
Kobe Roth set up the goal by firing a shot from inside the blue line. Hawkey got his blocker up to stop it, but couldn't control the rebound. Exell was already driving to the net when he chipped a bouncing puck over Hawkey's out-stretched glove.
The goal came after Exell spent some anxious moments in the penalty box with teammate Tanner Laderout during the Friars' 5-on-3 advantage. He picked up the second penalty in breaking up a scoring chance by slashing Providence's Jack Dugan from behind while driving alone to the net. Dugan was unable to get off a shot.
""Definitely, Tanner and I were stressing a little bit,"" he said. ""We were yelling even though they probably couldn't hear us. But yeah, we thought our penalty kill did a great job.""
Shepard stopped all four shots during the two power plays, including getting his left shoulder up to foil Scott Conway set up to the right of the net.
""It did swing momentum, I'm not going to lie to you,"" Friars coach Nate Leaman said.
Added forward Jacob Bryson: ""I guess it kind of hurt us a little bit. As a team, we expect to score on those 5-on-3s.
Minnesota Duluth had its first goal disallowed midway through the first period, when officials confirmed the whistle had blown the play dead before Exell poked in his own rebound under goalie Hayden Hawkey, who had appeared to cover up the puck.
Then, with 3:20 left, Cole Koepke had his goal disallowed after officials ruled following a lengthy review that the forward interfered with Hawkey when he swept in the puck from the slot and inside the left post.
NOTES: The Bulldogs featured 14 players with previous Frozen Four experience and, with captain Parker Mackay leading the team in playing his 13th NCAA Tournament game. ... Providence entered the Frozen Four with the most experienced lineup which was made up of six seniors and seven juniors. ... Friars associate head coach Ron Rolston made a homecoming after coaching the Buffalo Sabres spanning the 2012-13 and 2013-14 seasons.

AUGUSTA, Ga. — The name on top of the leaderboard on a steamy Thursday afternoon was as familiar as the shouts of encouragement that followed Tiger Woods everywhere he went in the opening round of the Masters.
For a little while, at least, it was beginning to look like old times again at Augusta National.
The booming drives seemed the same on a day when the ball was carrying far for everyone. The putting stroke was good enough, especially on the 14th hole when Woods drained a putt from across the hilly green for an improbable birdie.
And perhaps the most important thing? The confidence seemed back, even if Woods didn't quite get his history right after a 2 under 70 left him four shots off the lead after the first round.
""It's not a bad start,"" Woods said. ""I've only shot like under 70 one time (in the opening round), but I've shot 70 the four times that I have won here.""
It was three, actually, since Woods opened with a 74 in 2005 before roaring back to win in a playoff with Chris DiMarco. Hard to imagine then, but that's the last time anyone was sizing Woods up for a green jacket.
Woods didn't get much else wrong on a day where birdies were plentiful but swirling winds kept scores from trending too low. It was the kind of day that called for course management, and Woods knows more than most in the field how to take on Augusta National after playing 21 times previously in the Masters.
About the only thing Woods couldn't manage was the traffic jam coming off the 18th green, where he crossed ahead of Phil Mickelson as he was heading toward the 10th tee amid a noisy mass of sweltering Masters patrons.
If the start was decent, it wasn't great. Woods wasn't even the best player this day in his threesome, as Jon Rahm finished off a 69 to edge him by a shot.
And, of course, Brooks Koepka and Bryson DeChambeau loom large four shots ahead after opening 66s.
But decent in the opening round was good enough to win three of his green jackets. And Woods seemed to like the symmetry of this 70, even if it came because he bogeyed the 17th hole after hitting his tee shot into the trees.
""We still have a long way to go,"" he said. ""Tee off late tomorrow and the wind's supposed to be up, so I have my work cut out for me the rest of the week and so does everyone else.""
Woods was actually tied for the lead for the better part of an hour, the first time since the final round in 2007 that his name has been atop the gleaming white Masters leaderboards. His bogey on 17 dropped him back, but at 2 under he's in the middle of a large pack of players chasing the leaders.
Whether he can stay there depends as much on his mindset as his putting stroke. Woods proved he can win again after roaring to victory in the Tour Championship last year, but winning the majors is always more difficult. His track record since his win at the U.S. Open 11 years ago is not a good one.
He's 43 now, an age where the 5-footers that were once automatic don't always go in. Indeed, Woods missed makeable putts on Nos. 5 and 6 before steadying himself on the greens the rest of the way.
And if he needed any inspiration, he seemed to get it in Bernhard Langer shooting a 1-under 71 at the age of 61.
""There's a 61-year-old up there on that board, he knows how to play this golf course,"" Woods said. ""So it's a matter of missing the golf ball in the correct spots and picking your spots and when to be aggressive.""
Tiger fans can take hope in Woods' declaration that his body feels good and so does his game. But he's playing against guys little more than half his age who don't have bad backs.
How far Woods has come in just a short time became apparent when Woods revealed on the eve of the tournament that he took a nerve block just to be able to get to the champion's dinner here in 2017.
""I ended up going to England that night, saw a specialist there, (and) they recommended unfortunately for me the only way to get rid of the pain I was living in was to have the spinal fusion surgery,"" Woods said at the Golf Writers of America annual dinner.
The surgery was successful and now he's in the midst of a remarkable comeback that even has his detractors beginning to cheer for him. He's also shown a more human side that makes him even more endearing to golf fans.
The scene at the Tour Championship showed that as he was enveloped by fans swarming onto the 18th hole to witness a slice of history.
Who knows, come Sunday things could really look familiar if Tigermania breaks out once again.

DURHAM, N.C. — Cam Reddish is the latest Duke freshman to leave school for the NBA draft.
Reddish announced his decision on his verified Instagram page Thursday, one day after teammate RJ Barrett said he was entering the draft. School spokesman Mike DeGeorge says Reddish has hired an agent.
Reddish averaged 13.5 points and hit 33 percent of his 3-pointers, with several coming in clutch situations. That includes one with 0.8 seconds remaining to lift Duke past Florida State in January.
Reddish is widely projected as a lottery pick.
His decision leaves AP player of the year Zion Williamson as the last Duke freshman starter yet to announce his plans for next season. Point guard Tre Jones said earlier this week he would return for his sophomore year.

2019 N.B.A. Playoff Preview
There are intriguing teams in both conferences, and there should be some classic games, but Golden State is positioned to three-peat.
By
Benjamin Hoffman
The Golden State Warriors followed up their second consecutive N.B.A. title — and third in four years — by adding DeMarcus Cousins, the four-time All-Star. It became commonplace to declare that they had ruined the league by removing any suspense to the season. A starting lineup of five All-Stars, two of which are former recipients of the Most Valuable Player Award, was just too much.
There was palace intrigue, however. Kevin Durant and Draymond Green
feuded in public
, Cousins was routinely exposed on defense, Klay Thompson had a rough start and Stephen Curry’s shot seemed to fail him before he began wearing contacts on the court — in a scary acknowledgment that he had struggled with his vision for years even as he established himself as the deadliest 3-point shooter in N.B.A. history.
The drama — which many on the team have said is actually less than they dealt with last season — led to long stretches in which the Warriors seemed positively pedestrian. Perhaps most relevant to these playoffs, it led to them feuding with officials, and Durant and Green topping the N.B.A. in technical fouls.
It has widely been assumed that this will be Durant’s last season in Golden State. The quirks of the salary cap mean Cousins is almost assuredly gone as well. Shaun Livingston is likely to retire, Andre Iguodala can’t outrun time forever, Green’s long-term status is tenuous and Thompson is about to be a free agent. This could indeed be the last run of the Warriors dynasty.
Despite all of that ado, there is no reason to believe the Warriors can’t flip the switch and march to the finals, just like they did last year. The only potential obstacles seem to be a significant injury — the team has said an ankle injury to Curry is not serious, but that situation should be monitored — or a boredom with domination so deep that they loaf their way to a shocking upset.
With Cousins and Durant likely hoping to add a ring on their way out the door, focus shouldn’t be a problem. But first they will have to get there.
A preview of all eight first-round series shows there is plenty to watch and enjoy, even if Golden State is still “ruining” everything — and ends up the champion once again.
Western Conference
Game 1: Saturday, 8 p.m., ABC
The Clippers (48-34) were the N.B.A.’s most surprising team all season. The Lob City years may have been defined by a top-heavy roster of stars, but this group was far more anonymous and its talent stretched further along the bench. Led for most of the season by Tobias Harris, Danilo Gallinari and the bench duo of Montrezl Harrell and Lou Williams —
who this season became the N.B.A.’s career leader in points off the bench
— they coasted along, winning game after game in which they were counted out.
Even the Clippers’ management did not seem to believe in them, trading Harris and Boban Marjanovic to Philadelphia in February. The collapse that everyone predicted never happened, and the Clippers easily held off Sacramento for the West’s final playoff spot.
But this series is where the fun story ends. An overachieving team can be exhilarating to watch, and there were matchups where the Clippers might have surprised someone. But no matter how bored the Warriors (57-25) seemed this season, a loss in this series would overtake the 2007 We Believe Warriors’ upset of the top-seeded Dallas Mavericks as the most shocking first-round loss in recent history. Golden State is just too deep and too talented for the plucky Clippers to stand a chance.
Pick:
Warriors in 4
Game 1: Saturday, 10:30 p.m., ESPN
Don’t let their record fool you — the Nuggets (54-28) are broken, and it doesn’t take much to find the date of the fracture: Jan. 15. That day, Denver, which came into the game brimming with confidence as the No. 1 team in the West, got pulverized by the Warriors. The Nuggets allowed a record 51 first quarter points and lost, 142-111.
The Nuggets went 25-14 the rest of the way — not all that different than the 29-13 record they had going into the game — but any notion that they had emerged as a true contender was officially scuttled. Two more losses to Golden State helped drive that point home, as did a 5-6 record over the team’s last 11 games. The Nuggets barely held onto the No. 2 seed, nearly losing it to Houston on the final day of the season.
An optimist would point out that Denver keeping the No. 2 seed means it is uniquely positioned for a trip to the conference finals, as its win on Wednesday kept the Nuggets away from Golden State for the first two rounds. If the Nuggets can get past the Spurs (48-34), they would draw the winner of Portland-Oklahoma City.
Nikola Jokic is a truly special player, and will get a chance to shine on a national stage at some point, but even if the Nuggets are more talented than San Antonio, it is hard to believe that Coach Gregg Popovich can’t come up with a way to exploit Denver’s weaknesses and advance in what could be one of the more closely matched series.
Pick:
Spurs in 6
Game 1: Sunday, 3:30 p.m., ABC
Watching the video of the brutal leg injury sustained by Jusuf Nurkic last month is not recommended, but understanding its impact is fairly important in these playoffs. Nurkic, the Bosnian center, was in the middle of a career-defining season but will now miss the playoffs. He helped transform the Trail Blazers (53-29), from a team known for its transcendent guard combo — Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum — into a team that seemed dangerous against any opponent in the West besides Golden State.
Enes Kanter, who signed with the team in February after being bought out by the Knicks, can replace a fair amount of Nurkic’s offense and rebounding, but the defensive drop-off could hardly be more extreme. That could leave McCollum in the unenviable position of having this notorious moment on Twitter revisited:
With Nurkic, the Blazers likely would have been heavy favorites against the Thunder (49-33), but as it stands they seem outmatched by the combination of Paul George, Steven Adams and Russell Westbrook.
Oklahoma City is far from perfect. George’s play plummeted after injuries in the second half, and Westbrook continued his streak of seasons in which he’s averaged a triple-double but did so with a horrific shooting line of 42.8 percent from the field, 29.0 percent on 3-pointers and 65.6 percent from the free-throw line. Adams, though, should be able to swallow his good friend Kanter alive on both ends of the court, and the likelihood that George rises to the occasion should have Portland exiting in the first round for the third year in a row. This year, though, they should win at least one or two games. For Jennifer.
Pick:
Thunder in 6
Game 1: Sunday, 9:30 p.m., TNT
Sometimes you can win by losing. The Rockets (53-29) went into the season’s final day with a shot at the No. 2 seed in the West, but Denver’s win left Houston at No. 4. The beauty of that, should the Rockets survive a first-round matchup against Rudy Gobert and the Jazz (50-32), is that it would set them up for a face-off against Golden State in the second round, with James Harden as fresh as possible and with a far better chance of Chris Paul being healthy.
But first Houston will have to deal with Utah, a team that gets elite defense from Gobert — the team was the second-most efficient defense in the N.B.A., allowing 105.7 points per 100 possessions, according to Basketball Reference — and enough offense from Donovan Mitchell to stay competitive.
This Rockets team is far different from the defensive powerhouse that nearly knocked off Golden State in the conference finals last year. Trevor Ariza and Luc Mbah a Moute are missed on that end of the court, but Houston managed to rise out of an early funk thanks to Harden proving he had an even higher gear than the one he displayed en route to winning M.V.P. last season.
Harden’s average of 36.13 points a game was the highest by any player in N.B.A. history other than Wilt Chamberlain and Michael Jordan. And while he may not have averaged a triple-double like Westbrook, he scored 30-plus in 32 consecutive games and had two triple-doubles in which he scored 50 or more points. He now owns five of the 14 50-point triple-doubles in N.B.A. history.
Pick:
Rockets in 5
Eastern Conference
Game 1: Sunday, 7 p.m., TNT
The Bucks (60-22) were supposed to be good. But they weren’t supposed to be
this
good. The season began with debates about which team in the East would step into the vacuum created by LeBron James’s departure to the Western Conference: Boston, Philadelphia or Toronto. Surprise, surprise, surprise.
The stories about the team, and the immediate vicinity of the basket, were dominated by Giannis Antetokounmpo, the favorite to be named M.V.P. over Harden, but Milwaukee was not a one-man show. Khris Middleton was an All-Star, Eric Bledsoe seemed content to be a third option, and Brook Lopez, the lumbering 7-footer, continued his reinvention into perhaps the N.B.A.’s least likely 3-point specialist — and one of its most effective perimeter defenders.
A tear in the plantar fascia of Malcolm Brogdon’s right foot has the Bucks at slightly less than full strength for the first round, but the Pistons (41-41) barely qualified for the playoffs, and other than a fairly special season from Blake Griffin they offer little reason for any team to be afraid.
Pick:
Bucks in 4
Game 1: Saturday, 5 p.m., ESPN
The Raptors (58-24) were not expected to keep up with Boston or Philadelphia —
even by this writer’s predictions
— but they managed to jell around Kawhi Leonard faster than many predicted. Leonard’s health issues, while not entirely a thing of the past, did not stop Toronto from easily winning the most difficult division in the N.B.A.
Credit should go not just to Leonard, but also to Coach Nick Nurse, who did a solid job of competing night in and night out; to Kyle Lowry, who moved on,
reluctantly
, from DeMar DeRozan; and most of all to Pascal Siakam, who, in one season, went from being viewed as a fun role player to being called a future superstar.
That Toronto is a heavy favorite is a bummer for the Magic (42-40), a team that emerged from years of being atrocious and put on a good show nearly every night. The leap to All-Star by Nikola Vucevic was inspiring, and the athleticism on the roster can lead to some truly sensational highlights. Yes, the Raptors should win, and it’s entirely possible that they will sweep, but Orlando is one of the few teams that could get away with an attitude of just being happy to be there.
Pick:
Raptors in 5
Game 1: Saturday, 2:30 p.m., ESPN
The 76ers (51-31) likely have the most talented starting five outside of Golden State. Joel Embiid is a system unto himself — he’d prefer to be called a Process; Ben Simmons can do anything except shoot 3-pointers; and Jimmy Butler is not your friend, but he is a terrific all-around player. That the Sixers can complement those three with a pair of dead-eyed shooters like Tobias Harris and J.J. Redick almost seems greedy.
The price, it seems, is depth and cohesiveness: The starting five has managed just 161.1 minutes on the court together over 10 games. While Boban Marjanovic is a lot of fun coming off the bench — provided you’re not the one guarding him — there isn’t a lot else to speak about among the Sixers’ reserves.
The Nets (42-40), meanwhile, have depth in spades. D’Angelo Russell took the leap to All-Star-level this season; Spencer Dinwiddie is one of the league’s top sixth men; Jarrett Allen is a slender but formidable brick wall in front of the basket; and you never know when Caris LeVert and Joe Harris will dominate. Coach Kenny Atkinson managed to have 13 players average more than 17 minutes a game this season by mixing and matching his lineups (and by dealing with injuries).
The 76ers are rightfully the favorite. At any given point in a game they could claim to have the five most talented players on the court — with the possible exception of Russell over Redick and/or Harris. But a significant injury to any one of Philadelphia’s stars — always a concern with this team’s injury history — could be a death knell.
Pick:
76ers in 5
Game 1: Sunday, 1 p.m., TNT
What to make of the Celtics? The team made a run to the conference finals last season with a spark but without Kyrie Irving or Gordon Hayward, and then after getting them back from injury this year they were flat for much of the season. It’s not that they didn’t end up with good numbers — they were a top-10 team in offensive and defensive efficiency — but they didn’t scare anyone because of their inconsistency.
The Warriors proved last year that a team can meander through a regular season and then wake up in the playoffs. This team may not be quite as talented as Golden State, but the seed for a similar transformation does appear to be present should Coach Brad Stevens find a way to shake up his players and get them properly motivated.
If Boston thinks it can loaf its way through this series, however, it will be sadly mistaken. The Pacers (48-34) survived losing their best player, Victor Oladipo, to a season-ending knee injury and finished with the same record they had last year while showing small improvement in their efficiency on both ends of the court.
Boston is so talented that it has to be the favorite, but this is the series with the widest range of possibilities.
Pick:
Celtics in 6

Sacramento Kings coach Dave Joerger was fired Thursday after three seasons, the team announced.
""After evaluating the season, I determined that we need to move in a different direction in order to take us to the next level,"" general manager Vlade Divac said. ""On behalf of the entire Kings organization, I want to thank Dave for his contributions to our team and I wish him all the best.""
Joerger led the Kings to a 39-43 record this season, good for ninth place in the NBA's Western Conference. It was their best record since 2005-06 -- the last time they qualified for the playoffs.
The Kings started this season at 30-26 and were in the playoff hunt until a 9-17 finish left them nine games behind the Los Angeles Clippers for the final spot.
Joerger, 45, has six years of NBA head coaching experience, the first three with Memphis (2013-16) and the next three in Sacramento. His overall coaching record is 245-247 and 98-148 with the Kings.
His dismissal came on the same day that Divac and the Kings agreed to a four-year contract through the 2022-23 season, according to The Athletic.
Divac, who became GM in early 2015, has built a nucleus of promising young players that includes Marvin Bagley III, Buddy Hield, De'Aaron Fox and Bogdan Bogdanovic.
Divac, 51, played 16 seasons in the NBA for the Kings, Los Angeles Lakers and Charlotte Hornets. He will be enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in September.

Los Angeles Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw will make his first major league start of 2019 at home Monday against the Cincinnati Reds, the Dodgers announced Thursday.
The three-time Cy Young Award winner, working his way back after dealing with left shoulder inflammation during spring training, threw six innings on Tuesday night for Double-A Tulsa. He gave up five hits and two runs -- both on home runs -- in six innings. He struck out six and walked none.
His first rehab start came on April 4 with Triple-A Oklahoma City, when he tossed 4 1/3 innings and allowed two runs on four hits, including a home run, with two walks and six strikeouts.
Last season, Kershaw finished with a 9-5 record and a 2.73 ERA in 26 starts. In his 11-year career, the left-hander is 153-69 with a 2.39 ERA.

(Reuters) - UEFA opened disciplinary proceedings against Ajax Amsterdam and Tottenham Hotspur on Thursday after crowd trouble during their Champions League quarter-final matches this week.
Ajax were charged by European soccer's governing body with crowd disturbances after a supporter ran towards Cristiano Ronaldo while the Juventus forward celebrated with his team mates after opening the scoring in the 45th minute.
Charges against the Dutch side also included the throwing of objects by fans and blocked stairways during Wednesday's 1-1 draw in the first leg at the Johan Cruyff Arena.
Tottenham were charged after a supporter invaded the pitch at their new stadium during their 1-0 first-leg win over fellow Premier League side Manchester City on Tuesday.
Both cases will be dealt with by UEFA's control, ethics and disciplinary body on May 16.

(Reuters) - Everton manager Marco Silva wants to sign loanees Andre Gomes and Kurt Zouma permanently before the end of the season but the Merseysiders have yet to reach agreement with the parent clubs.
Barcelona midfielder Gomes, 25, has been influential for Everton in recent weeks as they claimed consecutive Premier League wins over Chelsea, West Ham United and Arsenal.
French defender Zouma, on loan from Chelsea, has become a mainstay in defence with 27 league appearances.
Asked if Everton, who are currently ninth in the table, could sign the pair immediately rather than wait for the close season, Silva said: ""There's always a chance.
""They are happy here, which is a good sign. That means they are performing, they are enjoying it and they are helping the team also.
""It's up to the clubs also. It's in the players' minds also and they have to decide together with their own clubs. In the right moment we will do something.""
Speaking ahead of Saturday's trip to Fulham, Silva has hailed 24-year-old Zouma's calming influence in defence alongside fellow centre back Michael Keane.
""He has the qualities to be a very, very good central defender -- but has all the conditions to improve too,"" he added.
""He's happy in our club, he's performing well and he's challenging with the other central defenders in our squad. It's a big fight for them and Zouma is proving his quality, like the others.""

So there they were, 15 men ready to launch the 10 charter teams of the National Football League in 1920. They gathered in Ralph Hay's car showroom in Canton, Ohio , and got down to business.
Except for one problem: There weren't enough chairs for everyone.
A few of the future owners of NFL franchises instead sat on the running boards of the modest Hupmobile in Hay's dealership. And when they were ready to sign the papers to establish the league, they leaned on the hood of the car to finish up.
While the fate of that actual Hupmobile — some have compared the quality of that brand of automobile to the Nash Rambler — isn't known, another vehicle of that model has become something of a mascot, if you will, for the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
""It serves two purposes,"" said Joe Horrigan, the executive director of the hall. ""We've had it displayed as a temporary exhibit for a couple of years, so it was the first thing visitors saw when they entered the Hall of Fame. We'd have a video story with it explaining why Canton is the site of the hall.
""Also it's there for the first play of the induction weekend; we do a symbolic start,"" he added. ""We'll have a human chain of kids from underserved neighborhoods line the street from downtown Canton and they pass a football the 2 1-2 miles to the steps of the Hall of Fame. Later (in the week) it starts the parade with the Hall of Famers (on induction day). It's like the grand master of the parade.""
The Hupmobile has had, among others, Hall of Fame President/CEO David Baker and Hall of Famers Ron Yary and Paul Krause as passengers.
The car makes its home these days at the Canton Classic Car Museum. There simply wasn't enough room at the hall; it also took an hour to get it in and out of the doors. Horrigan said there was no way they were going to store it with other artifacts that aren't always on display to the public. So the ""Hup"" headed to the museum, whose director originally had helped the hall find the car in upstate New York to purchase it.
Gary Hussar of the museum is the current ""cartaker.""
""I am the keeper of the keys,"" he said with a laugh, looking respectfully at the red bodywork and impressive grille.
""It only goes on the streets, no highway.""
During the NFL owners meetings in Phoenix, he gave a rundown of the memorable vehicle which features:
—a convertible top that opens and closes by hand;
—no side windows, making it a touring car;
—leather seats;
—a three-speed transmission;
—windshield wipers operated by a vacuum pump;
—old-fashioned brakes, as in very old, with no hydraulics.
""But it stops well,"" Hussar explained, noting the car's max speed is 35 mph.
""The engine has been restored,"" Hussar added. ""The electrics have been upgraded; it didn't have a fuel pump so an electronic fuel pump was added.""
Asked the biggest challenge driving the Hupmobile, Hussar smiled widely and mentioned he's in charge of driving it into its display areas.
""It's 67-inches wide,"" Hussar said. ""And the doors are 68 inches.""
Yet there's not a scratch on this old classic.
It's very likely the Hup will have a significant role in the Centennial Celebration the Hall of Fame is planning in September 2020. Maybe someone might even sit on the running boards.

One was a
serial bib forger
.
Another was a blogger who posted a photo of her running watch, which showed she cut the course of a half marathon,
then rode the racecourse again on her bike to recreate the right GPS track.
Yet another was a young woman who somehow
placed second in the women’s 70-74 age category in the New York City Marathon.
Then there was the tour company that allegedly worked with the director of a French marathon
to get runners qualifying times for the Boston Marathon.
All of these schemers have at least one thing in common — a 48-year-old financial analyst from Ohio, using an algorithm and an army of tipsters, nailed them for their dishonest racing deeds.
“It really was a curiosity,” said Derek Murphy, who started the website
Marathon Investigation
in 2015. He was inspired by the articles and forums at
LetsRun.com
, whose users sleuthed out whether a Philadelphia radio personality,
Mike Rossi, cheated in the 2014 Lehigh Valley Marathon to qualify for a Boston Marathon.
“That was dragging out for weeks, then months, about this one guy,” he said, “and I wondered if he was the only cheater.”
Turns out he wasn’t.
The Boston Marathon on Monday is the 39th anniversary of one of the most brazen attempts at marathon cheating — Rosie Ruiz’s notorious sprint from the crowd to the finish line to grab first place, until it was taken away from her days later. Ruiz was barely sweating at the finish and not very fit, both of which were tipoffs that something was amiss.
The cheaters Murphy nabs are more creative. He started out looking for people who cheat to qualify for Boston because, he said, “it was a way to make the task more manageable,” noting that he had to look only at the relatively small percentage of runners with Boston Marathon qualifier times.
Unlike other marathons, Boston requires nearly all runners to meet a certain standard for their age group to gain entry. The race has become so popular that a qualifying time no longer guarantees admittance, so Boston has adopted a policy of admitting fastest in each age group first, then descending from there. That makes cheating for a Boston entry especially egregious, Murphy said, because “when someone cheats to get into Boston, they are keeping out a deserving runner.”
Murphy is not worried about losing his own spot to cheaters. When he started his investigations, he called himself a “hobby jogger” who had run one marathon — the Flying Pig Marathon in Cincinnati in 2009, which he completed in 6 hours 3 minutes 5 seconds.
Married with two children, Murphy asks for donations through the site, and is also paid a consulting fee to verify the results of the California International Marathon, though he also has his day job as a financial analyst.
He has rededicated himself to running as he has become more immersed in this world. Last year, he ran the New York City Marathon and the Flying Pig Marathon, though his finishing times were still above six hours. He also ran in the Air Force Marathon, near Dayton, which was halted for slower runners because of heat, and in the NorthCoast 24-Hour Endurance Run in Cleveland, completing just over 74 miles.
Sometimes his hunt for the evildoers of marathoning begins with a tip, but he often begins by transferring results from a race website into a spreadsheet. The results can identify runners who showed significant changes in pace, or missed splits, meaning that they may have missed spots on the course where a microchip in their bib signals to a sensor that they are progressing.
Either could signal that they skipped a part of the race. Then he tries to find secondary evidence.
For that, he turns to photos taken by the race, which he can usually search for using a runner’s bib number. He looks for runners who dropped out of a race but got a result because the microchip on their bib triggered as it crossed the finish line.
Murphy also hunts down runners’ social media accounts, including the running network Strava, and searches for any writing they’ve done to see if they admitted to an offense or other clues that hint at wrongdoing. That was the case with
Ashley Rollins
, a coach and writer who posted on her website
that she used an unregistered pacer
in the 2018 California International Marathon, leading to her
disqualification
. She declined to comment for this article. He will also reach out to the suspected cheaters to see if they have an explanation, which sometimes prompts an admission and apology — and in that case he won’t write about them.
When Murphy does write about someone on his page, he will often not name the person and cover up the bib number he or she wore so other internet sleuths cannot easily find them.
“When I name somebody it has to be pretty egregious or some kind of special circumstances — they’re sponsored, they’re making money off this, they’re an ambassador,” he said. That was the case with Bre Tiesi-Manziel, a model who recently separated from her husband, the football player Johnny Manziel. She would have had to run a
world-record pace for 6.7 miles in a Divas Half Marathon for her time to be valid
. (Tiesi-Manziel did not respond to requests for comment.)
Murphy will approach race directors if he catches runners who used their course to cheat. The California International Marathon, which is known as a fast race, especially for those trying to qualify for the Boston Marathon (or even the Olympic Marathon trials), has hired Murphy to comb its race results for possible cheaters.
“It’s just like the
college admissions scandal
, taking a spot at an elite college that someone else earned,” Eli Asch, race director of the California International Marathon, said.
Not everyone is a fan. When Murphy wrote about
a woman he suspected of forging bibs to get into races
, she filed a Digital Millennium Copyright Act request to try to have his website taken down based on copyright violation over photos he used. (
She succeeded, for a few days
.)
Meg Reilly, director of communications for the Boston Athletic Association, which puts on the Boston Marathon, said the race’s registration officials use relationships with race directors and other officials to ensure the cleanest possible field.
“Someone who is running a five-hour-plus marathon, a non-age group marathon, cutting the course in some other way, still matters,” Asch said. “The runners who are justifiably proud of their marathon finish shouldn’t have to be proud of that finish with a shroud of doubt.”

SOUTH BEND, Ind. — Ian Book came into spring practice with the idea of being out of his comfort zone.
At a school that has produced its share of legendary quarterbacks, the 6-foot, 208-pound senior was told by coach Brian Kelly and offensive coordinator Chip Long to push the envelope.
""I want to make those even harder throws into those smaller windows,"" Book said after completing a school-record 68.2% of his passes (214 of 314) for 2,628 yards and 19 touchdowns in leading Notre Dame to a playoff berth after a 12-0 regular season. ""That's what it takes to be an elite quarterback, to have an elite offense.""
The season-ending, 30-3 loss to Clemson fuels Book's hunger to be even better. A late-season rib injury that forced him to miss the Florida State game was followed by a three-game span (victories over Syracuse and Southern California before the playoff loss) during which Book's completion rate fell to 56.4%. He was just 17 of 30 for 160 yards against the Tigers, whose nasty defense forced him to scramble over and over again.
The message this spring: Get rid of the happy feet, stay in the pocket, go through the reads and take a chance on the throws he dared not to attempt in 2018. Including the deep ones.
""I expected a lot from Ian this spring,"" said Long, now in his third year as coordinator. ""I told him, 'Hey, challenge it. Challenge the offense. Test your arm.' Ian has been challenging himself with all of his throws. There hasn't been a fear to turn it loose. You've got to push yourself to do that if you want to be considered an elite quarterback.""
Book took up Long's gauntlet, on the field and in the locker room.
""I wanted to challenge myself more, but I didn't want to create bad habits or force throws that are not possible,"" Book said. ""I wanted to be more of a vocal leader, something I've been working on a ton. Another was challenging myself on the tighter (pass-catch) windows. The third was going through my full-read progression — the second and third reads are where the tight windows are — and trusting the guys to be in the right spot, trusting the offensive linemen, and staying in the pocket and delivering the football.""
Kelly and Long said they like what they've seen in more than a dozen practices ahead of Saturday's 90th Blue-Gold game.
""Vertically, (Book's) throwing the football down the field with accuracy, confidence, movement in the pocket,"" Kelly said after Book hit junior receiver Michael Young for a touchdown pass on a fourth-and-10 play to end a recent practice. ""(He has) ball placement on back-shoulder throws (and there's) a little more air for our guys to adjust to the football. What we can see has been a nice step up for him.""
Book's teammates have seen the positive changes, too.
""He's come into spring being 'the guy' with nothing to worry about,"" said fifth-year slot receiver Chris Finke, who averaged 11.7 yards on 49 receptions that were third behind NFL-bound Mile Boykin (59) and Chase Claypool (50). ""He's reading defenses well, delivering throws with confidence.""
On Tuesday, Book was as accurate as ever with all of his throws, the best a back-shoulder, 40-yard effort to Claypool, a 6-foot-4, 229-pound senior.
""This spring I would say he's insane consistent,"" Young said. ""It's like ridiculous — the ball is never in the wrong place, the timing is always there, it's never too early, it's never too late. Geesh! I just really can't do no wrong because he's going to make me right.""
Kelly and Long have been able to turn their attention to 6-foot-5, 225-pound Phil Jurkovec, who saw mop-up action in two games his freshman season but has a clear role as the likely backup this year with Brandon Wimbush's departure to Central Florida as a graduate transfer. Quarterback Brendon Clark, a 6-foot-2, 217-pound true freshman, arrives on campus in June.
""Phil is a confident guy — and I like it — and he wants to be a great quarterback,"" Long said. ""He's way more confident that he was when he came in last August. The little things every day . all the things a young quarterback needs to do and just keep building confidence in himself.""
Kelly said he sees Jurkovec mastering those little things.
""I think (there's been) the natural kind of evolution of a quarterback kind of learning college football at the highest level — some good days followed up by some not-so-good days,"" Kelly said of Jurkovec. ""We're beginning to add a little more with him and we're feeling pretty good that he's making the progress.""
So is Book, who has lofty goals.
""You watch any guy in the NFL, it's pretty amazing they are able to stay relaxed in the pocket, go through all their reads and make the right throws,"" Book said.

LOS ANGELES — Montrezl Harrell scored 24 points to lead seven players in double figures and the Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Utah Jazz 143-137 in overtime on Wednesday night, snapping a three-game skid to close the regular season.
Ivica Zubac added 22 points and 11 rebounds and Patrick Beverley had 14 points in his return from injury.
The Clippers' losing streak had already dropped them from the sixth seed to No. 8 in the playoffs, where they'll open against the defending champion Golden State Warriors.
Grayson Allen led Utah with a career-high 40 points. The rookie made 13 of 14 free throws and five 3-pointers, but was limited to four points in overtime.
The Jazz earned the fifth seed and they'll play No. 4 Houston in the first round.
The Clippers dominated overtime, 17-8. Zubac had back-to-back dunks and rookie Jerome Robinson scored six of his seven points.

ANAHEIM, Calif. — Justin Bour hit a two-run single in a four-run third inning and the Los Angles Angels won their sixth straight game Wednesday night with a 4-2 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers.
The Angels (7-6), who played without star outfielder Mike Trout, are over .500 after beginning the season 1-5. Trout strained his right groin during Tuesday's win but said he hopes to be available for this weekend's series in Chicago against the Cubs.
Bour is batting only .156 in his first season with the Angels but had a solid series against the Brewers. He was 3 for 10 with a home run and four RBIs as Los Angeles completed a three-game sweep.
The Brewers were swept for the first time since the series before last year's All-Star break, when they dropped a five-game set at Pittsburgh (July 12-15). It is only the second regular-season series in its last 17 that Milwaukee has lost.
Jaime Barria (1-0), called up from Triple-A Salt Lake earlier in the day, allowed one run in 2 2/3 innings of relief. Hansel Robles earned his first save.
Felix Pena went the first four innings for the Angels, permitting an unearned run and three hits.
Brandon Woodruff (1-1) gave up four runs and four hits in six innings with seven strikeouts.
Christian Yelich had two hits and drove in both Milwaukee runs. Lorenzo Cain also had two hits.
Milwaukee struck first in the third when Yelich drove in Ben Gamel with a two-out single.
In the bottom half, the first five batters reached base for the Angels. Andrelton Simmons tied it with a bases-loaded single that scored Kevan Smith. Bour blooped a single that plated David Fletcher and Kole Calhoun. Simmons scored when Albert Pujols grounded into a double play.
Yelich brought Milwaukee within two in the seventh with another RBI single.
TOSSED
Smith was ejected before the eighth inning for arguing balls and strikes with plate umpire Phil Cuzzi. Smith struck out looking to end the seventh and voiced his frustration after the at-bat. After going into the dugout to put on his catcher's gear, Smith came out and continued arguing with Cuzzi before being tossed. It was the first ejection of his career.
ANOTHER MILESTONE
Pujols played in his 1,000th game for the Angels and became the 10th player in major league history to play at least 1,000 games with two teams.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Angels: Shohei Ohtani is likely to have a medical check in the next couple of days and is anxiously awaiting clearance to face live pitching in batting practice. The 2018 AL Rookie of the Year, who had Tommy John surgery last October, has been taking swings on the field the past two weeks.
""I think everything's going to start speeding up after that,"" Ohtani said through a translator. ""I feel really good hitting outside. The distance is there, the power's still there, so it's going really well so far.""
Angels manager Brad Ausmus indicated Ohtani is still on track to return in May. Ohtani has not started running the bases and said he is still in the very early stages of throwing.
Brewers: 3B Travis Shaw was hit on the right hand by Pena's pitch in the second inning and left the game. The team said X-rays were negative and Shaw is day-to-day with a bruised hand.
UP NEXT
Brewers: Begin a three-game series Friday against the Dodgers in a rematch of last year's NL Championship Series. RHP Corbin Burnes (0-1, 9.00 ERA), whose first major league win came against Los Angeles on July 21 last season, gets the assignment in the opener.
Angels: Continue interleague play with a three-game series in Chicago against the Cubs. Tyler Skaggs (1-1, 2.45 ERA) will make his first career appearance at Wrigley Field on Friday.

MILWAUKEE — Oklahoma City wanted a win to avoid slipping into a first-round playoff matchup against the defending NBA champion Golden State Warriors.
The Milwaukee Bucks, with the NBA's best record already clinched, just needed to stay healthy.
Everybody got what they wanted Wednesday night.
Russell Westbrook posted his 34th triple-double of the season and the Thunder beat the Bucks' backups 127-116 to lock up the sixth seed in the Western Conference playoffs.
Oklahoma City (49-33) played without injured Paul George, but Westbrook, Jerami Grant and Dennis Schroder led a hot-shooting effort. Oklahoma City made a franchise-record 23 3-pointers and handed out a franchise-best 40 assists, converting 48 of 99 shots to win their fifth in a row.
""Good teams always respond,"" Schroder said. ""We do whatever it takes to go out there and compete and play with each other. We live with the result.
""Now the playoffs come. Now everybody is excited.""
Westbrook had 15 points, 17 assists and 11 rebounds. He moved into a tie with Magic Johnson for second place on the career triple-double list with 138, behind only Oscar Robertson (181).
""It's a blessing,"" Westbrook said.
Schroder was 8-of-15 shooting beyond the arc and had a game-leading 32 points. Grant hit four 3s and added a career-high 28 points.
The Bucks (60-22) rested star Giannis Antetokounmpo and some other key players. They found out moments after the game that they would face eighth-seeded Detroit in the first round of the playoffs.
The Pistons secured a playoff berth with a win over the New York Knicks on Wednesday.
Khris Middleton was the only usual Bucks starter in the starting five, and he scored 21 points in 17 minutes.
Point guard Tim Frazier scored a career-high 29 points and added 13 assists for Milwaukee and D.J. Wilson had a career-high 18 points while grabbing 17 rebounds. Rookie Bonzie Colson started and scored 21 points.
Middleton said the Bucks are more confident entering the playoffs than they have been in the past. The franchise has not won a playoff series since the 2000-01 season and has not had homecourt advantage in the first round in the last eight first-round series.
""First place in the league, 60 wins, and we have homecourt,"" Middleton said. ""Forget about the things in the past in some ways. Just keep moving forward.""
The Bucks finished tied for the third-best record in franchise history and their best since the 1980-81 season.
""We're just trying to soak it all in right now,"" said Bucks guard Eric Bledsoe, who was held out Wednesday. ""We went through a lot of adversity to get to this point. I'm really proud of this group.""
TIP-INS
Thunder: Oklahoma City faced a waiting game to find out its first-round playoff foe. The Thunder had a chance to face Denver, Houston or Portland, depending on results of Wednesday's late games. George did not play after aggravating a right shoulder injury in the Thunder's 112-111 victory over Houston on Tuesday night. George hit the game-winning 3-pointer vs. the Rockets with 1.8 seconds left.
Bucks: Antetokounmpo and Brook Lopez sat out the season finale for load management, and point guard Eric Bledsoe did not play. It was the first game Lopez missed after starting all 81 games and it was the 10th game Antetokounmpo missed. ... F Nikola Mirotic could be ready for the start of the playoffs this weekend. Mirotic suffered a fractured left thumb against the Los Angeles Lakers on March 19 and did not play in the final 11 regular-season games. ... G Tony Snell (left ankle sprain) is unlikely to return at the start of the playoffs. Sterling Brown will keep his spot in the starting lineup.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Sacramento's best season in 13 years wasn't enough to save coach Dave Joerger's job.
General manager Vlade Divac fired Joerger on Thursday after he helped develop the young Kings into playoff contenders before ultimately falling short in the franchise's 13th straight losing season.
""I think he did a great job to make that step,"" Divac said. ""But moving forward, I just felt like we had to go a different direction. It's been three years and we made some progress. This year was a good season but I think we could do more, especially after All-Star break.""
Divac said he had been contemplating the decision to change coaches for a while and ultimately made it after the team stumbled to the finish with a 9-16 record after the All-Star break. The poor stretch run left Sacramento with a 39-43 record, nine games out of a playoff spot after being tied for the eighth spot in the West heading into the final game before the break.
The Kings had their most wins since having a 44-38 record in coach Rick Adelman's final season in 2005-06. That ended a run of eight straight playoff berths and Sacramento hasn't been back to the postseason since for the NBA's longest active drought.
""After the All-Star break, I felt very confident we'd be in the race and we were in the race,"" Divac said. ""Unfortunately, we fell short.""
Divac made the move official just hours after he was given an extension through the 2022-23 season by owner Vivek Ranadivé. Divac took over as GM before the 2015-16 season and helped bring in some of the key pieces that have led to the improvement this year, including guards Buddy Hield and De'Aaron Fox and big men Marvin Bagley III, Willie Cauley-Stein and Harry Giles.
Divac also made a trade this season to acquire forward Harrison Barnes from Dallas in hopes of making a playoff push but the team faltered down the stretch.
""Vlade has been vital to what we are building here and I am so pleased to announce his extension,"" Ranadivé said. ""Throughout his entire career, Vlade is someone who has always made those around him better, both on and off the court. I look forward to our bright future ahead.""
Joerger was the ninth coach since Adelman was fired in 2006 with none able to post a winning record or a playoff berth. In fact, since moving to Sacramento before the 1985-86 season, the only winning seasons for the Kings came in Adelman's eight seasons at the helm highlighted by a trip to the Western Conference final in 2002.
Divac is now counting on coach No. 10 being the one that can get the team back to the level it had under Adelman, when the Kings were a contender for several years and played an entertaining brand of basketball.
""The next level is to be a team that is going to be a playoff team and down the road a contender,"" Divac said. ""I think our kids are very talented. We have to believe in them and give them a chance to take advantage of their work and talent.""

AUGUSTA, Ga. — As the man in the green jacket recounted the incredulous events of the past week, Corey Conners cocked his head to one side and smiled ever so slightly.
Almost as if he couldn't believe it, either.
A little over a week ago, Conners snatched the last spot in the Valero Texas Open by the skin of his teeth. Then he won the tournament with 10 birdies in the final round, claiming the last opening at the Masters.
So here he is at Augusta National.
Ready to compete for a green jacket.
""A special week, a crazy week,"" Conners said. ""Things are good.""
Certainly, the 27-year-old Canadian wasn't thinking about the Masters on his way to San Antonio, where his first — and, really, only priority — was the chance to earn a much-needed paycheck. Because he was outside the top 125 in the FedEx Cup standings, he had to earn his way into the Texas Open during Monday qualifying.
Up to 100 players go at it for 18 holes during Monday qualifying, with the top four finishers getting into the actual tournament. Conners went to the final hole needing a 20-foot birdie putt just to get into a six-man playoff for the last of those spots. He made the putt, and then poured in another birdie on the first of the extra holes to vanquish the other five contenders.
Dramatic stuff indeed.
Though, in all honesty, no one was paying much attention. Since 1980, only four Monday qualifiers on the PGA Tour had gone on to win the tournament.
Make it five.
Conners' performance was impressive. His wife, Malory, even became a bit of a celebrity for her reactions while lugging a cup of white wine.
""She's been my biggest fan for years and my biggest supporter,"" Conners said. ""I'm really lucky to have her by my side. It's pretty cool to see her in the spotlight a little bit. Her reactions were awesome. You can see how much she cares about what I'm doing, and it means a lot to me. It was pretty cool. She got a lot of messages and gained a lot of followers on social media, so she was pretty pumped about that.""
Count Justin Rose among those new-found fans.
""I loved the cameras being on her and you could tell what a big moment it was for the two of them,"" the world's top-ranked player said. ""It was very special to see those stories out there because winning is difficult and it's nice to see it when it does change someone's life.""
But Conners takes issue with those who make him out to be some sort of Rocky, the hopeless underdog who makes for a good story early in the week but is quickly shoved aside as soon as the Rory McIlroys and the Tiger Woodses take to the course.
He tied for third at the Sony Open in Honolulu, shooting back-to-back 64s on the weekend, and finished second last fall at the Sanderson Farms Championship, four strokes behind winner Cameron Champ.
Conners is not even a Masters rookie. He qualified for the event as an amateur in 2015, though he was not ready for such a stiff test. He opened with an 80 and missed the cut.
Conners feels much better equipped this time around.
""Everyone was calling me the Monday qualifier, but I don't feel like a Monday qualifier,"" he said. ""I've played well in a bunch of tour events this year.""
A little more time to prepare would've been nice, but that's a minor complaint. Valero flew him to Augusta on a corporate jet, his clothing supplier sent along some new duds and his manager took care of housing and other arrangements that had to be made on short notice. Conners did have to do a bit of shopping after arriving in Augusta, ""so I could get a couple T-shirts and a pair of pants to go to dinner in.""
He has got good memories from his last Masters appearance.
After that rough start, he bounced back to shoot a 3-under 69 in the second round.
""I've been playing rounds over in my head,"" Conners said. ""Although the course has changed slightly, a lot of the shots are going to be pretty similar to what I faced in 2015. ... I think the course suits my game really well, so I'm really, really excited to get going.""
He already is playing with house money.
Might as well let it ride.
""I was excited to watch the coverage on TV back at home for an off week,"" Conners said. ""But, you know, I'm even more excited to be here playing.""

A look at what's happening around the majors Wednesday:
THE BIG 3-0
Whit Merrifield can set a record for the longest hitting streak in Royals history. He extended his streak to 30 games Tuesday night, tying the team mark set by George Brett in 1980. Merrifield's string started last season and he's hit safely in all 10 Kansas City games this year. The Royals will face rookie Yusei Kikuchi and the Seattle Mariners at Kauffman Stadium.
OUT OF CONTROL
Yu Darvish tries again to find the strike zone after two shaky starts for the Cubs. The four-time All-Star has walked 11 over 6 2/3 innings so far, with an 8.10 ERA. Darvish was hurt for most of last season, his first with Chicago after signing a $126 million, six-year deal. He next faces Pittsburgh at Wrigley Field.
YOU AGAIN
Bryce Harper takes another swing at his former team when the Philadelphia Phillies host Washington. Harper hit a three-run homer Tuesday night off ex-teammate Stephen Strasburg, but the Nationals rallied from a five-run deficit to win 10-6 in 10 innings. Harper, who spent his first seven seasons in Washington before signing a $330 million, 13-year contract with the Phillies, also homered in his first game against his old club last week.
SPOTLESS
Cleveland right-hander Trevor Bauer (1-0, 0.64 ERA) pitches in Detroit, looking to extend his dominant start to the season. Bauer was pulled after seven hitless innings last Friday against Toronto and has yielded only one hit over 14 innings. Matthew Boyd (0-1, 3.18) and the Tigers try to halt the Indians' five-game winning streak. The lefty struck out a career-high 13 in his last outing April 3 at Yankee Stadium.
NOT A NIFTY FIFTY
Slumping Orioles slugger Chris Davis might get a chance to end his record hitless streak. The lefty hitter didn't play Tuesday night when the A's started a left-hander against Baltimore. Davis extended his drought to 0 for 49 this week, the longest rut by a position player ever in the majors. The former home run champion will see if he plays when Oakland starts right-hander Frankie Montas at Camden Yards.

HOUSTON — A woman has sued the Houston Astros for more than $1 million, saying that a T-shirt cannon by the team's mascot at a game last season broke her finger.
The Houston Chronicle reports that Jennifer Harughty alleges that the mascot, who is named Orbit, ""shattered"" her left index finger during a game last July when a T-shirt fired from a ""bazooka style"" cannon into the stands struck her finger.
The Astros said in a statement Tuesday the team is ""aware of the lawsuit with allegations regarding Orbit's T-shirt launcher. We do not agree with the allegations. The Astros will continue to use fan popular T-shirt launchers during games. As this is an ongoing legal matter, we will have no further comment on this matter.""
The Chronicle reported court records said Harughty was seated in the middle of the first deck behind the third base line when the incident occurred. The lawsuit said the fracture required two surgeries to repair.
The newspaper reported court records said two screws were placed in her finger to repair the break and that she needed to attend physical therapy two times a week after the surgery. The suit added she ""continued to suffer pain, swelling and loss of range of motion."" Her second surgery was performed in October and Harughty's lawsuit says that her finger still isn't right and ""remains locked in an extended position with little to no range of motion.""
The lawsuit alleged the Astros were negligent in not using reasonable care in the firing of the T-shirt cannon and that they failed to provide warnings to fans about the risk the cannons pose and not properly supervising staff to ensure the safety of fans.

General manager Vlade Divac and the Sacramento Kings agreed to a four-year contract through the 2022-23 season, according to The Athletic.
Financial terms were not announced.
Divac, who became GM in early 2015, has built a nucleus of promising young players that includes Marvin Bagley III, Buddy Hield, De'Aaron Fox and Bogdan Bogdanovic.
The Kings finished 39-43 this season and in ninth place in the NBA's Western Conference. That was the Kings' best record since 2005-06 - the last time they qualified for the playoffs.
The Kings started 30-26 and were in the playoff hunt, however, until a 9-17 finish left them nine games behind the Los Angeles Clippers for the final spot.
Divac, 51, played 16 seasons in the NBA for the Kings, Los Angeles Lakers and Charlotte Hornets. He will be enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in September.

LUGANO, Switzerland — Two-time Grand Slam champion Svetlana Kuznetsova rallied from a set and a service break down to beat Timea Bacsinszky 5-7, 6-3, 6-4 in the second round of the Samsung Open on Thursday.
Playing in her first tournament in more than six months, Kuznetsova, 33, passed her second two-hour test on Lugano's clay courts.

It has all been going so smoothly for Manchester City. Perhaps too smoothly.
In winning 22 games out of 23 from Dec. 30, City was often in cruise control and came up against opponents who mostly sat back and engaged in a damage-limitation exercise.
Bournemouth, playing at home, didn't have a shot in its 1-0 loss to City on March 2. Watford fielded a virtual reserve team for its 3-1 loss at Etihad Stadium a week later.
Just last week, City enjoyed 79% possession in beating Cardiff 2-0. Four days earlier, City scored two goals in the first 27 minutes at Fulham and barely got out of second gear in another 2-0 win.
Hunting for an unprecedented quadruple, City's players were winning easily and managing to preserve their energy levels at the same time. Their cup draws have been so benign that they have reached two domestic finals and the Champions League quarterfinals without playing any team in the top six in England, Spain, Italy or Germany.
But this begs the question, how battle-hardened has this actually left City for its defining weeks of the season?
The first leg of the Champions League quarterfinals against Tottenham on Tuesday kicked off an exacting run of five games in 15 days, three coming against Spurs — two in Europe and one in the league — and the two others being matches at Crystal Palace — in its atmospheric, tightly packed Selhurst Park — and Manchester United. A two-legged Champions League semifinal, against Juventus or Ajax, may follow.
It hasn't started well. City, at times, couldn't live with Tottenham's intensity and energy in a 1-0 loss in the London club's new stadium on Tuesday. There were sloppy errors, petty fouls (especially from the permanently-on-the-edge Fernandinho) and opportunities were snatched at.
""We were not brave enough in the game,"" City midfielder Ilkay Gundogan said, ""and we made a lot of simple mistakes.""
The second leg is at the Etihad next week, when City can expect more in-your-face pressing from Mauricio Pochettino's hard-working Tottenham side. Before then, City must travel to Palace in search of a win to keep pace with Liverpool in the title race.
Palace is one of the four teams to beat City in the league this season, 3-2 at the Etihad in December, and was also the team that ended City's record 18-game winning run in the league last season. Guardiola has previously said it is one of the hardest grounds to win at.
In Spain, Real Madrid's season fell apart in a disastrous seven days at the end of February and start of March, when it lost three straight games to exit the Champions League and Copa del Rey and also drop out of realistic contention in the league.
""It's all gone in a week,"" Madrid defender Dani Carvajal said at the time.
Could the same be about to happen to City?
Guardiola can't really be reproached, with his team so close to making history. Some accused him of overthinking his team selection against Tottenham, picking Fabian Delph at left back and Riyad Mahrez at right wing and leaving out Kevin De Bruyne and Benjamin Mendy. Only Guardiola can judge the fitness levels of his players in this arduous period, though, and both Mendy and De Bruyne are coming back from injury-enforced absences.
And how else could Guardiola have navigated the schedule from January to March, when he was often faced with a bunch of easy opponents — in relative terms — for City? Maybe he is just the victim of circumstance.
But in the next few weeks, City's players — no matter how fatigued they might be starting to feel — need to play at a different level of intensity then they have in recent weeks. After 52 games of a grueling and potentially record-breaking season, can they manage it?
If they can't, they could finish the season with only the two domestic cups to show for all their efforts. And that is providing they get past a resurgent Watford in the FA Cup final on May 18.
That would be regarded as a successful season for almost any other side, but not for this City team.

SYDNEY — Rugby Australia said on Thursday it would terminate the contract of Israel Folau, the country's best-known and best-paid player, if he cannot offer a good reason for a social media post that said gay people would go to ""hell"" if they did not ""repent"".
The 30-year-old fullback, a fundamentalist Christian, posted similar comments last year but escaped sanction and signed a new deal with RA through 2022 in February.
That multi-million dollar contract looks certain to be torn up unless Folau can convince RA and the New South Wales Waratahs that there are ""compelling mitigating factors"" for sharing the post.
A statement from RA Chief Executive Raelene Castle and her Waratahs equivalent Andrew Hore said they had made repeated attempts to contact Folau since he posted the comments on Wednesday.
""Whilst Israel is entitled to his religious beliefs, the way in which he has expressed these beliefs is inconsistent with the values of the sport,"" the statement added.
""Israel has failed to understand that the expectation of him as a Rugby Australia and NSW Waratahs employee is that he cannot share material on social media that condemns, vilifies or discriminates against people on the basis of their sexuality.
""As a code we have made it clear to Israel formally and repeatedly that any social media posts or commentary that is in any way disrespectful to people because of their sexuality will result in disciplinary action.
""In the absence of compelling mitigating factors, it is our intention to terminate his contract.""
The unprecedented move will throw into disarray Australia coach Michael Cheika's plans for the Rugby World Cup in Japan later this year.
Folau has been all but ever-present in the Wallabies number 15 shirt since switching to rugby union from Australian Rules in 2013 and scoring two tries on his test debut against the British and Irish Lions.
He has scored 35 more tries in 72 tests since and helped Australia to the final of the 2015 World Cup in England, where they were beaten by New Zealand.
An elusive and dangerous runner, Folau helped the Waratahs to the Super Rugby title in 2014 and only last weekend became the highest career try-scorer in the competition when he crossed for his 60th five-pointer.
Folau has had previous lucrative offers to play in Europe and Japan but his stated desire to remain in Australia makes his most likely destination a move back to rugby league, a code in which he represented Australia at the start of his career.
'NO INTENTIONAL HURT'
Raised as a Mormon, Folau moved to a pentecostal church in 2011 and has made no secret of his religious beliefs since.
He was a critic of the proposal to make same-sex marriage legal in Australia before it was passed in 2017 and last year took to Instagram with his first post about gay people being destined for hell.
Castle said then that RA ""accepted"" his position that he had just been expressing his beliefs and had not intended to ""upset people intentionally or bring hurt to the game"".
Wednesday's post, which took the form of a meme based on verses from the bible, said gay people and others he perceived to be ""living in sin"", including ""drunks"", ""idolaters"" and ""atheists"", would be condemned to hell.
The post drew widespread condemnation from around the world with New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern among those criticising Folau for the way he was using 'his platform'.
Japan rugby captain Michael Leitch posted a video in Instagram in which he said Folau's comments were ""wrong on so many levels"" and could be ""a real stab in the heart"" for people struggling with their mental health.
The RA and Waratahs statement on Thursday said they wanted rugby to be a sport that unites and welcomes people regardless of their ""race, gender, religion or sexuality"".
""No language that isolates, divides or insults people based on any of those factors can be tolerated,"" it said.
Pride in Sport, which works to make Australian sport inclusive for LGBT people, later welcomed the decisive action taken by Castle and Hore.
""This unprecedented course of action sends a strong message of what will and will not be tolerated in rugby – and they've made it clear that homophobia and transphobia has no place in the sport,"" said Andrew Purchas, founder of the Sydney Convicts, Australia's first and most successful gay rugby club.

LONDON — The world athletics governing body (IAAF) has closed an ethics investigation into its president Sebastian Coe after finding there was no basis on which ""any disciplinary case could be established"" that he had ""intentionally misled"" a British Parliamentary Committee in 2015.
""The investigation has therefore not identified evidence of a potential breach of the code of ethics by Lord Coe,"" it said.
Coe has denied throughout that he misled the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee when he appeared before it in December 2015, four months after being elected IAAF president.
""I want to thank the ethics board for all the work they do,"" said Coe in a statement.
""When I became President of the IAAF, I promised greater transparency and integrity. I hope this demonstrates that no-one is above the rules and everyone in the sport is subject to the same scrutiny.""
Coe, previously an IAAF vice-president, was questioned about what he knew about doping in Russian athletics before he took office. In its final report 'Combating doping in sport' in 2018, the committee criticized Coe's answers as misleading.
""It stretches credibility to believe that he was not aware, at least in general terms, of the main allegations,"" the report added.
The IAAF's ethics board then opened an investigation in September into whether Coe's conduct had violated its own regulations.
Coe, a double Olympic 1,500 meters gold medalist, insisted that he did not know the specific detail of an email sent to him by former London Marathon race director David Bedford in 2014.
Bedford said the attachments contained details of how Russian marathon runner Liliya Shobukhova had sent hundreds of thousands of dollars to the IAAF to cover up positive doping tests.
Shobukhova was banned for three years and two months, later reduced by seven months for assisting with investigations.
Although Coe confirmed receiving the email, he said he forwarded it to the IAAF ethics board without reading the attachments.
The board said in its decision on Thursday that Coe ""behaved appropriately"" by referring the matter.
""Coe's evidence is that his personal assistant forwarded the email with its attachments to the Chairperson of the Ethics Board and that he (Coe) did not read the attachments,"" it said.
""The investigation did not find any evidence inconsistent with that position.""
Damian Collins, chair of the DCMS committee, said he stood by the report.
""Lord Coe either knew more than he suggested he did when he gave evidence to the committee, or he knew enough about the Shobukhova (matter) to have asked more questions about it within the IAAF at the time,"" he said in a statement.

LOS ANGELES — Vasyl Lomachenko left Ukraine and moved stateside several years ago because he dreamed of fighting for big money in the world's most popular boxing venues.
After headlining at Madison Square Garden, in Macau and in several spots around Las Vegas, Lomachenko is going Hollywood on Friday night.
Lomachenko (12-1, 9 KOs) risks his two lightweight world titles at Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles when he takes on Britain's Anthony Crolla.
Crolla (34-6-3, 13 KOs) is a big underdog against the masterful Lomachenko, whose technique and athleticism have propelled him from two Olympic gold medals to the short list of the world's greatest pound-for-pound fighters.
Lomachenko trains outside Los Angeles, and he has already fought in the LA area twice. But he has never appeared in this fight-loving city's most prominent indoor arena, and the mere idea of headlining in such a cavernous venue would have been improbable just a few years ago.
""It's a very exciting place,"" Lomachenko said. ""After my first (LA) fight at Microsoft Theater, I looked across the street and thought, 'Wow, maybe someday I can get into Staples Center.'""
Less than two years after that LA debut in the smaller Microsoft venue, Lomachenko has moved across the street for a title defense he is expected to win with style — and not just because he's wearing an outlandish robe worth a reported $200,000 into the ring.
Any opponent under 140 pounds would be an underdog against Lomachenko, but the lack of a theoretically worthy opponent doesn't interest the champion. Until a bona fide challenger to his dominance emerges at 130 or 135 pounds, he will keep racking up wins.
""I don't care,"" Lomachenko said with a smirk. ""In my fights, I just want to show off my skills. My opponent, whoever. I just want to enjoy it and to put on a good and interesting fight.""
Lomachenko's next fight was supposed to be a title unification bout with Ghana's Richard Commey, who holds one of the two remaining lightweight belts that Lomachenko covets. But Commey emerged from his bout Feb. 2 with an injured right hand, and Lomachenko elected to stay active by entertaining his mandatory challenger for the WBA crown.
While Crolla is widely respected for his toughness and resilience, Lomachenko sometimes seems to be competing in a different sport. His footwork alone inspires rhapsodic appreciation from veteran fight watchers, and his hand speed is similarly peerless.
Crolla has watched Lomachenko's bouts with admiration, but he has been fighting for too long to be intimidated.
""He's the best fighter in the sport, and I'm grateful for this chance,"" Crolla said. ""Even the best fighter in boxing is beatable. Nobody is bigger than the game, so I go into this fight knowing I've got a chance and a strategy to beat him.""
Crolla is making his U.S. debut, but the Manchester native is likely to have every British athlete's contingent of vociferous stateside fans. Crolla has another advantage, according to Lomachenko.
""He's very good, and he's in a comfortable position because he has nothing to lose,"" Lomachenko said.
The Staples Center card also includes Mexican star Gilberto ""Zurdo"" Ramirez making his light heavyweight debut against Tommy Karpency in the co-main event, along with veteran brawler Mike Alvarado facing unbeaten Arnold Barboza Jr.
Lomachenko isn't looking beyond Crolla to other fights, partly because no big fight looms. He wants Commey's belt, but the biggest money would come from a showdown with former American lightweight champion Mikey Garcia.
But even if Garcia could get over his antipathy toward Top Rank boss Bob Arum — his former promoter and Lomachenko's current promoter — Lomachenko and Garcia probably can't find a common weight. Lomachenko says he is too small for 140 pounds, and Garcia could struggle to get back down to 135 after fighting at welterweight — and getting thrashed by Errol Spence Jr. — last month in Texas.
Until money creates the motivation to solve this dilemma, Lomachenko will go on showcasing himself to the world against the best opponents he can find. Crolla is worthy, and Lomachenko is taking him seriously.
""I get nervous a little before a fight, but when I step in the ring, I'm in my place,"" Lomachenko said. ""I start to enjoy it right away. A couple of rounds, and then I find my moment.""

AUGUSTA, Ga. — Justin Harding of South Africa spent most of his Masters debut Thursday atop the leaderboard, and that's not an unusual position for him over the past year.
No one else at Augusta National can claim five victories and three runner-up finishes since the last Masters. Then again, few Masters competitors were in the Lombard Insurance Open or the Royal Swazi Open.
The biggest win of his career so far was the Masters — in Qatar, not Georgia. Harding moved into the top 50 of the world ranking to secure his first Masters invitation with a runner-up finish in the Kenya Open.
""I handled the emotions of the day quite well,"" Harding said after opening with a 3-under 69.
And for one day, it was a reminder that winning anywhere in the world means a player is doing something right.
He stood out as an example of why the PGA Tour believes some other tours might be getting too many world ranking points based on weaker fields. This has nothing to do with Harding. All he has done is play tournaments, and the 33-year-old who competed collegiately at Lamar outside Houston is playing the best golf of his life.
He ended 2017 at No. 712 in the world. He goes into the Masters at No. 49.
In the last year, he has won twice on the Sunshine Tour (one was a 54-hole event), twice on the Asian Tour and once on the European Tour (Qatar Masters).
He made his American debut two weeks ago in the Dell Match Play, and while he didn't advance out of his group, he managed to beat Matt Fitzpatrick and Luke List, while losing to Rory McIlroy.
Most of these courses are new to him, just like Augusta National.
So when Harding was reminded of his rookie status at the Masters, and how it has been 40 years since a newcomer won a green jacket, he wasn't bothered.
""It's pretty much how I've been playing for the last 15 months,"" Harding said. ""I'm seeing the golf course for the first time almost every week. So I'm not taking any real demons, any bad shots or any bad memories into them, I suppose.""
He knows Augusta National a little better from watching the Masters over the years. He has an idea how to attack or avoid certain pins.
""We executed our plan and played away from flags when we needed to, counted on a good putter, and that certainly worked for the most part today,"" he said.
Only one of his five birdies came on a par 5, at No. 15, and it required a wedge off a severe slope and to about 7 feet, which he rapped in with his long putter. He dropped a shot on the beefy par-4 fifth and at the last when he failed to get up-and-down from a bunker.
""At the end of the day you're going to make some mistakes out here,"" he said. ""Nobody really goes bogey-free. It's just a matter of making more birdies than bogeys and seeing what happens over the weekend.""
Gary Player (three times), Charl Schwartzel and Trevor Immelman are the other South Africans to win a green jacket. Harding sought some advice from Ernie Els, who had to settle for the silver medal twice at Augusta. He also played practice rounds — nine holes a day because of the rain — with Schwartzel, Branden Grace, Louis Oosthuizen and British Amateur champ Jovan Rebula.
""Just trying to pick the big boys' brains and it's just helpful,"" he said. ""We played the golf course in our brains a few times having watched it on TV. You know where to hit it. It's just a matter of handling the nerves and executing the golf shots.""

Here are the winners and losers even before the opening tip of the 2019 NBA playoffs:
BIG WINNER: The NBA.
Without LeBron James around anymore, the Eastern Conference playoffs are actually unpredictable. Imagine that. Well, starting with the second round, anyway. When the Boston Celtics passed the Indiana Pacers late in the regular season, it increased the chances of the East's Big Four -- the Milwaukee Bucks, Toronto Raptors, Philadelphia 76ers and Boston -- getting together for some pretty great basketball in early May. And a potential Houston Rockets-Golden State Warriors semi in the West? More must-see TV. Coming soon.
BIG LOSER: Dwyane Wade.
Gotta say: Tuesday night was an all-timer in the NBA, highlighted by the going-away parties for Wade and Dirk Nowitzki. It was a shame they had to share the national stage, and that's on Wade. If he'd been inspired to put on more dazzling displays like his grand finale and fewer like the lackluster effort in the February home blowout loss to the Detroit Pistons that in the end cost the Heat a playoff spot, we'd be seeing a potential seven-game Wade vs. Giannis extravaganza starting this weekend.
SMALL WINNER: Neil Olshey.
Did anyone notice that the Portland Trail Blazers actually got better just when their season appeared to blow up when Jusuf Nurkic and CJ McCollum got hurt late in the tightly contested Western playoff battle? Credit Olshey, the Portland general manager who had the foresight to add another big quality man (Enes Kanter) and another scorer (Rodney Hood) before things got desperate. Now it's Kanter vs. Oklahoma City's Steven Adams in a true rarity -- a classic battle of big men -- in a powerful first-round duel of former teammates.
SMALL LOSER: Giannis Antetokounmpo.
Yes, it could have been Giannis vs. Wade. Or Giannis vs. the entertaining Brooklyn Nets, against whom he had a triple-double and averaged nearly 30 points a game. Even Giannis vs. the Charlotte Hornets' Kemba Walker would have been better than ... Giannis vs. the Pistons. Ugh. The Bucks dominated their Central Division rival this season, sweeping the four-game series, even though Detroit coach Dwane Casey found a way to suck the life out of the MVP candidate, twice holding Giannis to 15 points. Do yourself a favor: When Bucks-Pistons Game 1 comes on television this weekend, switch over to the Masters. Even a replay if need be.
LOSERS WHO'LL SOON BE WINNERS: Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Kyrie Irving.
The curtain closed on the regular season with Anthony Davis getting booed by his home (former) fans, even though he's still under contract with the New Orleans Pelicans. You got LeBron on the sideline and Magic Johnson out of work, and it's all interrelated. And don't think it ends now that the playoffs are here. The over/under is 24: the number of hours between the season-ending loss and the announcement that Durant, Leonard and Irving are out of here. Who will be the first to get the Davis treatment on his way out the door? Somewhere, odds are being posted.

(Reuters) - Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson says performing well in an advanced midfield position for England helped convince manager Juergen Klopp he could play a more attacking role for his club.
Klopp has used Henderson mainly as a defensive midfielder since taking charge of Liverpool, asking the 28-year-old to curb his attacking instincts and shield the back four.
""I can do both positions and (Klopp) sees I can do both, it's basically what he wants and needs,"" Henderson told reporters. ""I felt more comfortable... in (an advanced) position for England, creating chances and doing what I enjoy doing.
""I feel as though I can do more in a position further forward. Me and the gaffer had a conversation. Obviously he saw the England games... and it was something he said he'd think about.""
Klopp deployed Henderson on the right of his midfield trio in Liverpool's last two games and the captain rewarded the manager with decisive contributions in each match.
He came off the bench and scored the final goal in Liverpool's 3-1 win over Southampton in the Premier League on Friday and helped create the second in their 2-0 Champions League quarter-final first leg win over Porto on Tuesday.
The addition of defensive midfielder Fabinho at the start of the season helped make the decision to move Henderson further forward easier.
""In the last couple of years there hasn't really been a player like Fabinho in that role, so I've had to adapt,"" Henderson said. ""I just thought that might give me a bit more licence to get forward more.""
Liverpool, who lead the Premier League table by two points having played one game more than second-placed Manchester City, host third-placed Chelsea on Sunday.

(Reuters) - West Indies appointed Floyd Reifer as their new interim head coach on Thursday, replacing Richard Pybus as part of a series of administrative changes less than two months before the World Cup.
Pybus's contract ran beyond the World Cup in England and Wales, but new Cricket West Indies (CWI) president Ricky Skerritt said changes were necessary and a ""calculated strategic move"" to reignite the passion for cricket in the region.
Barbados-born Reifer played six tests, eight one-day internationals and one Twenty20 for West Indies between 1997 and 2009 before moving into coaching.
""Up to the end of 2018 Floyd Reifer had been identified as the outstanding emerging local coach,"" Skerritt told a news conference in Antigua.
""He displayed this by leading the West Indies A team successfully, including victories against the England Lions, and ended the past year by coaching the Senior men's team to a T20 series win in Bangladesh.""
England's Pybus replaced Australian Stuart Law in January. He guided the team to a test series win over England, while the ODI series against the top-ranked side ended 2-2.
Among other changes, Skerritt overhauled the selection panel, with Robert Haynes replacing Courtney Browne as interim head of selectors.
""We have found it necessary to immediately adjust our selection policy to become more open, inclusive, and player-centric,"" he said.
""I am therefore pleased to confirm that we have terminated the old embedded selection policy which secretly, but actively, victimised some players and banished them from selection consideration.""
As part of the old selection policy, availability for domestic tournaments was a requirement to be picked for West Indies squads, but Skerritt said selectors would be allowed to pick all players who make themselves available.
Contractual disputes between players and CWI have weakened the team for several years, but Thursday's announcement could pave the way for players such as Keiron Pollard to return to the ODI fold for the first time since 2016.
""Participating in a World Cup is a career defining experience for West Indian players and coaching staff,"" Skerritt said.
""We therefore believe it is strategically more beneficial for a West Indian coach with the proven skill sets to have this exposure at CWI's expense - rather than a foreign coach.""
Twice winners West Indies open their World Cup campaign against Pakistan in Nottingham on May 31.

(Reuters) - Tottenham Hotspur's England striker Harry Kane suffered serious ankle ligament damage in Tuesday's 1-0 Champions League victory over Manchester City, the Premier League club said on Thursday.
Kane rolled his left ankle in the second half of the quarter-final first leg after a hefty tackle on City defender Fabian Delph and left the field immediately.
Spurs gave no timeframe for when Kane might be fit again.
""Following assessment over the past two days, we can confirm that Harry Kane has sustained a significant lateral ligament injury to his left ankle following a challenge in our Champions League quarter-final, first leg win against Manchester City,"" Spurs said on their website.
""Investigations are ongoing and he will continue to be assessed by our medical staff over the coming week.""
The England captain, who has scored 24 goals in all competitions this season, left the club's new stadium on crutches with a protective boot on his foot.
On Wednesday, 25-year-old Kane had tweeted: ""Gutted to go off injured but every setback is a chance to come back stronger than ever. Big finish from the boys to go on and win!""
Spurs also said England midfielder Dele Alli had fractured his left hand in Tuesday's game and was being assessed to see if he can play against relegated Huddersfield Town on Saturday.
Fourth-placed Tottenham are battling for a top-four finish to claim a Champions League spot for next season. They trail third-placed Chelsea by two points, with a game in hand, and lead fellow London rivals Arsenal by one point.

DETROIT — Andre Drummond had 20 points and 17 rebounds and Ish Smith matched a season high with 22 points, helping the Detroit Pistons come back from a 22-point deficit to beat the Memphis Grizzlies 100-93 Tuesday night and cling to a spot in the playoffs.
Detroit can clinch a postseason bid by closing the regular season with a win Wednesday night at New York.
The Pistons put their postseason position in peril by losing four straight before rallying to beat the short-handed Grizzlies.
Detroit star Blake Griffin was limited to five points and two rebounds in 18-plus minutes, barely playing in the second half because of his injured left knee.
Luke Kennard scored 15 points off the bench and Reggie Jackson had 12 points before going to the bench as Smith flourished in the final quarter.
Detroit opened the fourth with a 16-3 run to pull within three points. Smith made a game-tying 3-pointer and a go-ahead jumper midway through the quarter.
Drummond made two free throws with 2:33 left to put the Pistons up 91-89. Smith made a jumper to give Detroit a five-point lead with 50 seconds left and a runner to put it ahead 97-93 with 28 seconds remaining.
Delon Wright and Bruno Caboclo each scored 15 points for the Grizzlies, who used just four reserves with banged-up players such as Mike Conley, Joakim Noah and rookie Jaren Jackson out with injuries.
Even though Detroit had a lot to play for — its first playoff berth in three years and second in a decade — the Grizzlies played with more effort and led 32-20 after the first quarter and 57-38 at halftime.
The Pistons picked up the intensity in the third quarter, outscoring Memphis by four to cut their deficit to 79-64.
TIP-INS
Grizzlies: Tyler Zeller fouled out midway through the fourth quarter with 13 points and six rebounds
Pistons: Team owner Tom Gores attended the game, cheering for his team and complaining about calls to officials. Gores hosted 40 college students as part of the Flint Promise scholarship program, which he has funded in part with $1 million.

SAN ANTONIO — Derrick White's ascension into the starting lineup and the pivotal role he has played in helping San Antonio earn its 22nd straight postseason appearance was a greater surprise to him than anyone else.
To hear his teammates and coach Gregg Popovich tell it, the soft-spoken kid not only belongs in the spotlight, he commands it.
""He has been spectacular,"" Popovich said. ""Everything he's done has been off the charts and I couldn't be more thrilled for him.""
The second-year point guard who did not receive a single scholarship offer from a four-year institution coming out of high school is about to step onto an even bigger stage: His first postseason start comes Saturday in his native Colorado as the seventh-seeded Spurs take on the second-seeded Nuggets in Denver, not far from where he played high school ball in suburban Parker. He averaged 8.2 points, 3.2 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 2.2 steals and only one turnover as the Spurs split their four-game season series against the Nuggets.
A year ago, White had wrapped up a successful season with the Spurs' G League affiliate in Austin and would remain on the bench for most of San Antonio's first-round loss to Golden State. White watched as Dejounte Murray closed an impressive first season as the Spurs' starting point guard after replacing Tony Parker, who was still having an impact off the bench for San Antonio.
White was hoping to earn more minutes this season after averaging 23 points and seven assists for the Spurs' summer league team in Las Vegas. It was the same drive he demonstrated in transferring to Colorado after spending his first three seasons playing for Division II Colorado-Colorado Springs to improve his draft stock.
Then came July: San Antonio traded Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green to Toronto for DeMar DeRozan and Jakob Poeltl, shifting the team's look on the wing. Parker left in free agency — and then Murray suffered a season-ending knee injury Oct. 7 in a preseason game.
Suddenly the point was wide open for the taking.
""You never want to lose a player, but the silver lining is who steps up in his stead,"" Denver coach Michael Malone said. ""Derrick White, what a great story. (He started out as a) Division II player, goes to Colorado and now he is in San Antonio and playing well for them.""
He has done more than help. White has become a vital part of the team, averaging 9.9 points, 3.3 rebounds, 3.2 assists and only 1.4 turnovers in 25.8 minutes per game.
DeRozan called White ""awesome"" and All-Star LaMarcus Aldridge has enjoyed his finest overall season with the Spurs, including the first 50-point game of his 13-year career, in part because of how quickly he and White bonded on the court.
""The intangibles, the things that you can't really teach for a point guard to understand,"" Aldridge said of White's strengths. ""How to read the pick-and-roll, how to read the guy coming off. You can try to teach guys that, but some guys just get it.""
The Spurs like his work on the other end of the court, too. At 6-foot-4 with long arms and a wiry frame, White has drawn comparisons to Murray and Green on defense. He had a career-high six blocks against Atlanta on March 6 and a career-high six steals against Denver on Dec. 28.
""I think Derrick White is an elite defender,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said.
White may have begun the season as an unknown, but he has now become a victim of his own success. Teams are focusing more on him now, which led to him scoring a combined 20 points over the final four games in March. He broke out of that with a 23-point game in a win over Atlanta and averaged 12.0 points as the Spurs went 4-1 in April.
""Once he got confident, he was playing great,"" Spurs forward Davis Bertans said. ""I think the other teams started paying more attention to him, so, it's always going to be like that for a while. It's going to be a little bit tougher, until he gets used to that physicality and the defense being focused on him a little bit more. The more experience he gets, the better he's going to be.""
And the Spurs are all for that.
""I'm in his ear every game telling him to take advantage of the opportunity because I've believed in him since day one,"" Aldridge said. ""I've been telling him that we're going to need him to go to where we want to go.""

Astros 8, Yankees 6
By
James Wagner
HOUSTON — Jose Altuve, the 5-foot-6 star second baseman for the Houston Astros, long ago proved that height doesn’t matter that much. He is a six-time All-Star, three-time batting champion and one-time Most Valuable Player Award winner. This week, he added “thorn in the Yankees’ side” to his résumé.
With his team leading by just one run in the fifth inning on Wednesday, Altuve clobbered a jaw-dropping blast off the light tower in left field at Minute Maid Park. It was his second home run of an 8-6 Houston victory and his fourth of the three-game series, which yielded the first sweep of the Yankees in Astros history.
Two for 'Tuve.
pic.twitter.com/mhqOB7IY8I
The Yankees mounted a rally in the top of the eighth inning. Luke Voit hit a two-run home run, D.J. LeMahieu contributed an R.B.I. double and Clint Frazier brought in a run with a sacrifice fly, trimming the deficit to one run. But more mistakes in the field, an underlying theme this season, came back to haunt the Yankees: A throwing error by shortstop Gleyber Torres in the bottom of the frame contributed to a key Astros insurance run.
Before the season, the Astros and Yankees both fancied themselves World Series contenders. Two weeks into a six-month regular season, the Yankees (5-7) have lost three of their four series. Only one of their opponents posted a winning record last season: the Astros.
“We’ve got to tighten it up a little and play obviously a little bit better, but I believe we’re really close to turning the corner,” Yankees Manager Aaron Boone said, adding later: “The intent, the focus, the game plan — I feel like is all there. It’s just a matter of putting it all together. And when we start clicking, we’ll get this baby rolling.”
James Paxton, the Yankees’ biggest off-season acquisition for their rotation, faltered through four innings and surrendered five runs on eight hits to the Astros (8-5). He fell behind hitters but also struggled to put them away when given the chance.
Of Paxton’s 95 pitches, 26 were fouled off, including 14 with two strikes, and just eight were swings and misses.
Although Paxton sputtered, the Yankees trailed by only 3-2 after four innings. In the first inning, Altuve homered and Yuli Gurriel tripled in a run — on a ball that center fielder Brett Gardner slid for and missed.
A first-inning home run by Gardner and a sacrifice fly by LeMahieu in the fourth trimmed the Yankees’ deficit to one run. Then with his team trailing by a run, Boone leaned on Paxton to avoid putting more strain on a taxed bullpen. The decision backfired.
Boone sent his starter, with a pitch count of 91, back out for the fifth inning against the middle of the Astros’ order. The first pitch: a low 94-mile-per-hour fastball that Altuve sent into orbit. Three pitches later, Michael Brantley singled and chased Paxton from the game.
“He was seeing it tonight,” Paxton said of Altuve. “I made some bad pitches to him. Pitches in the middle of the plate. I need to be better with my location. All night, I wasn’t really locating really well.”
Relief pitcher Tommy Kahnle entered and prompted coughed up a two-run blast to Carlos Correa. At the end of the inning, the Yankees trailed by 7-2.
Some help is on the way for the wounded and inconsistent Yankees. C.C. Sabathia, who was several weeks behind his teammates because of off-season surgeries on his heart and one of his knees, is slated to return from the injured list on Saturday against the Chicago White Sox.
Although not returning as soon as Sabathia, other injured Yankees have made some modest progress: Outfielder Giancarlo Stanton (out since April 1 with a left biceps strain) began light swinging on Tuesday, and third baseman Miguel Andujar (out since April 1 with a torn right labrum) began throwing on Wednesday.
Andujar made 25 throws from 60 feet and said he expected to throw again on Friday, as well as swing for the first time since his injury. “It was better than I thought it would be,” he said.
Catcher Gary Sanchez, the Yankees’ best power hitter so far this season, is not on the I.L., but he was out of Wednesday’s starting lineup with what he described as some tightness in his lower legs. Sanchez first felt it during Monday’s game, and he served as the designated hitter on Tuesday.
Sanchez pinch-hit during the eighth-inning rally on Wednesday and struck out. Before the loss, he said hoped to return to the starting lineup on Friday, for the Yankees’ next game.

Seth Jones' power-play goal late in the third period capped a thrilling rally, as the Columbus Blue Jackets erased a three-goal deficit and stunned the host Tampa Bay Lightning 4-3 on Wednesday in the opening round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs.
Jones scored his second career playoff goal when he rang a shot off the crossbar with 5:55 to play. He took a slick pass from Artemi Panarin and roofed the power-play goal to complete a spree of four unanswered goals, three of which came in the third period.
Josh Anderson had a goal and an assist, and Nick Foligno and David Savard also tallied for the Blue Jackets, who lost all three regular-season meetings with the Lightning by a combined score of 17-3.
In matchup of the two top goaltenders in games won this season, Columbus' Sergei Bobrovsky made 26 saves while Andrei Vasilevskiy stopped 22 shots for the Lightning.
Tampa Bay, who won the Presidents' Trophy and tied an NHL single-season record with 62 wins, led 3-0 after one period on goals by Alex Killorn, Anthony Cirelli and Yanni Gourde.
The Lightning blitzed the Metropolitan Division club in the opening 20 minutes.
Tempers flared early when Tampa Bay's Dan Girardi blindsided Brandon Dubinsky at 2:55 of the first period. The two fought in the neutral zone, and Columbus' Scott Harrington grappled with Cedric Paquette, who ended up pinned to the ice by Harrington.
However, Tampa Bay struck first when Jones bobbled the puck at the blue line on the power play, and Killorn stole it, raced in on a breakaway and beat Bobrovsky for a short-handed goal at 4:12.
Bobrovsky's weak pass around the boards from behind his goal allowed Erik Cernak to get off a long blast, and Cirelli, who scored 19 goals in his rookie season, flipped in the rebound at 11:01.
Gourde tipped in a shot from the slot by Mikhail Sergachev at 17:50 for the three-goal advantage.
Foligno started the rally, beating Vasilevskiy on the blocker side off a breakaway for his seventh playoff marker at 9:15 of the second period to trim the deficit to 3-1.
Savard's wrister on a quick rush at 7:56 of the third period cut it to 3-2.
Dubinsky's double-minor for high-sticking Paquette at 9:23 had the Blue Jackets playing defensively on the penalty kill, but Anderson tied it with a short-handed goal at 11:54, setting the stage for Jones' winner.

Left-hander Clayton Kershaw came out of Tuesday's rehab start healthy and his next appearance will be with the Los Angeles Dodgers, manager Dave Roberts said Wednesday.
Kershaw will start either Sunday at home against the Milwaukee Brewers or on Monday against the visiting Cincinnati Reds.
The Dodgers ace, working his way back after dealing with left shoulder inflammation during spring training, threw six innings on Tuesday night for Double-A Tulsa. He gave up five hits and two runs -- both on home runs -- in six innings. He struck out six and walked none.
His first rehab start came with Triple-A Oklahoma City, when he tossed 4 1/3 innings and allowed two runs on four hits, including a home run, with two walks and six strike outs.
--St. Louis Cardinals leadoff hitter Matt Carpenter has signed a two-year contract extension, the team announced in a news conference at Busch Stadium.
The extension runs through the 2021 season and includes a possible option for a third season.
The team did not announce financial terms, but Mark Saxon of The Athletic reported the deal is worth a combined $39 million for the next two seasons. If he reaches 1,100 plate appearances over the next two seasons, the deal will be worth $18.5 million for 2022.
--The hunt continues for the person responsible for the theft of five firearms and $20,000 from the home of Atlanta Braves outfielder Nick Markakis.
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported someone broke into Markakis' home in the Buckhead section of Atlanta on March 29 and walked off with the money, weapons and a luxury watch.
A neighbor called police after spotting someone in the home. The Braves were in Philadelphia that night.
--Forbes estimated the New York Yankees to be worth $4.6 billion, a 15 percent increase from 2018, in its annual list of team values.
Rounding out the top five were the Los Angeles Dodgers ($3.3 billion), Boston Red Sox ($3.2 billion), Chicago Cubs ($3.1 billion) and San Francisco Giants ($3 billion).
--Wednesday's game between the Atlanta Braves and Colorado Rockies was postponed due to a blizzard warning in Denver.
A storm moving through the area could bring 2 to 6 inches of snow and wind gusts up to 65 mph, according to the National Weather Service.
The game was rescheduled for Monday, Aug. 26, at Coors Field.

Mets 9, Twins 6
By
Kevin Armstrong
After back-to-back outings in which Mets pitcher Zack Wheeler surrendered seven walks and Jacob deGrom, the team’s ace, gave up three home runs, Manager Mickey Callaway knew his prized pitching staff needed a strong start Wednesday.
“Unfortunately, we’re not clicking on all cylinders right now,” Callaway said. “We have a great pitching staff and will at some point, but we’ve got to weather the storm.”
Noah Syndergaard (1-1) stepped into the center of it at Citi Field. In need of a win to manage a split against the Twins, he struck out the game’s first batter and then, even as he allowed a few runs to score, managed to help himself in a few key ways. It was enough to give the Mets a 9-6 win and to improve their record to 7-4.
“That was much needed,” Callaway said. “We needed a starter to go really deep. That’s Noah Syndergaard.”
For a change, the Mets watched the opposing pitching staff lose all command. Five Minnesota pitchers issued 10 walks — six in a raucous six-run fifth inning.
“They just didn’t make good pitches,” said Mets right fielder Michael Conforto, who was 1 for 3 with a walk and three runs batted in. “They were out of the zone.”
While Syndergaard, who gave up four earned runs over seven innings, was solid for most of the night, the Mets’ bats were silent for four innings. Then Jeff McNeil slapped a single to left field. Amed Rosario and J.D. Davis both drew walks to load the bases for Syndergaard, who had executed a sacrifice bunt in the third inning.
The first pitch to Syndergaard went to the backstop, and catcher Mitch Garver retrieved it on a ricochet. McNeil, then on third base, started to run home, stopped and failed to get back to third before Garver threw to pitcher Jake Odorizzi, who was covering home. Odorizzi then threw to third baseman Willians Astudillo, who tagged out McNeil.
The Mets were not done walking. Syndergaard drew one, too, and that was it for Odorizzi. Andrew Vasquez, a lefty, entered the game, and proceeded to hit Brandon Nimmo in the back with a pitch, scoring Rosario. Vasquez then forced in two more runs with walks to Pete Alonso and Robinson Cano.
When asked about his team’s approach, Callaway joked: “Keep on taking! Don’t swing!”
Out went Vasquez; in came Trevor Hildenberger, who couldn’t manage a strike against Conforto, forcing in the Mets’ fourth run of the inning. Hildenberger did throw a strike on his third pitch to Wilson Ramos, but the catcher connected with it, singling to right and bringing in two more runs for a 6-1 lead.
The Mets welcomed it all as they readied to travel to Atlanta for a four-game series at the start of a 10-game road trip that will include stops in Philadelphia and St. Louis.
Syndergaard’s start, while far from perfect, helped ease concerns about the team’s pitching. The Mets’ staff had been a mess in recent days. Wheeler called his seven walks in Sunday’s loss to the Nationals “embarrassing.” DeGrom said he “couldn’t locate anything” against the Twins one start after he struck out 14 Marlins.
“We need to keep these games a little bit closer so we’re in striking range,” Callaway said.
To bolster the staff, the Mets recalled the right-hander Corey Oswalt from Class AAA Syracuse before Wednesday’s game, sending down Tim Peterson. Peterson had followed Wheeler in Sunday’s walk fest, issuing five free passes of his own.
“I think our offense has been able to pick us up and get us to where we’re at,” Callaway said. “I’m pretty excited where we are at, given how we’ve pitched. They’ll pick up the slack and get it going here soon.”
Syndergaard, for seven innings, more than picked up the slack against Minnesota, allowing just one run. While he and Jeurys Familia combined to allow four runs in the eighth, and Edwin Diaz allowed one more in the ninth, the Mets managed to stave off a third straight loss.
Syndergaard said fatigue had set in during his final inning, but that he wanted to make a statement for the starting rotation.
“I think I can speak on behalf of all five starting pitchers that regardless of the situation, you’re still going to have to probably pry the ball out of our cold dead hands to take us out of the game,” he said.

MANCHESTER, England — Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer knows all about improbable Champions League comebacks and hopes his side can serve up a repeat of last month's victory against Paris St Germain at Barcelona's Nou Camp stadium next week.
United, who were beaten 1-0 by Barca at Old Trafford in the quarter-final first leg on Wednesday, lost the home match of the previous round to PSG 2-0 before turning the tie around in the French capital.
That result gives the Norwegian manager the belief that his team are capable of progressing to the semi-finals, despite the fact that Barca are unbeaten in their last 30 Champions League home games going back to 2013.
""The PSG performance gives us hope and belief we can do it, but we are playing against the favourites,"" said Solskjaer, who famously netted United's stoppage-time winner in the 1999 final against Bayern Munich at the Nou Camp, one of the competition's most famous comebacks.
""It will be a bigger achievement winning that one because with the history of Barcelona, they are not used to losing at home but we can do it. No doubt about it,"" he said.
Although neither Marcus Rashford nor Romelu Lukaku were able to trouble Barca keeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen on Wednesday, Solskjaer believes the United forwards can get opportunities in Spain.
""We are a goal threat, be it Rom or Rash or whoever is playing up there we have to create chances for them.
""We have to take our chances. You have to be very efficient over there. We know we are not going to create loads of chances. We have to take the ones we get.
""We have to soak up the pressure, accept they will want to kill the tie and want to put the sword into us. We have to soak that pressure and break and keep the ball at times better than we did,"" he said.
""Away from home we beat Juventus, we beat PSG, we have to go to Barcelona and win that one. We know that we have possibilities in this tie. Now is not the time to think about our home performances. Now we’ve got to look forward to the future.""

PORTLAND, Ore. — Damian Lillard scored 30 points to lead the Portland Trail Blazers to a 115-108 victory over a Denver Nuggets team that rested its top three scorers Sunday night after securing home-court advantage in the playoffs.
Al-Farouq Aminu added 23 points and 11 rebounds for Portland, which held on to fourth place in the Western Conference with two games remaining. The win snapped a six-game losing streak to the Nuggets.
Gary Harris had 18 points for Denver, which played without Nikola Jokic, Paul Millsap and Jamal Murray.
After trailing by 14 points in the first half, Denver closed the gap in the second half and pulled to 92-91 on Torrey Craig's 3-pointer before taking the lead on free throws.
The teams traded the lead but Juancho Hernangomez hit a 3-pointer that put the Nuggets in front 104-98 with 5:14 left.
Lillard's 3-pointer put the Blazers ahead 107-106 and Enes Kanter extended the lead with a layup with 2:18 left. Aminu added free throws and a reverse layup that made it 114-106 and sealed the win.
The Blazers got back CJ McCollum, who was out for 10 games with a left knee injury. Coach Terry Stotts said before the game that his minutes would be restricted, but McColllum played 25 minutes and had nine points.
The Nuggets defeated the Blazers just two days before. Jokic had 22 points, 13 rebounds and nine assists, and Denver clinched the Northwest Division title with a 119-110 victory on Friday night. It was the team's first division title in six years.
The Nuggets were assured of at least the No. 3 seed in the Western Conference and can clinch the second seed with two more wins. They haven't been the No. 2 seed since the 2008-09 season.
But with home-court clinched, the Nuggets sat Jokic, Millsap and Murray against the Blazers.
""We just want to make sure we're healthy, rested and playing as well as we can going in,"" coach Michael Malone said.
Portland started the day a game up on Utah for the fourth seed. The Jazz played the Lakers on Sunday night. The Rockets held on to the No. 3 seed with a 149-113 win over the Suns.
The Nuggets led by eight points in the opening minutes, but Portland caught up and took a 29-25 lead going into the second quarter. Portland stretched the lead to 14 before heading to the break with a 60-49 lead.
Portland reserve guard Seth Curry, who sat out Friday's game with leg soreness, came off the bench to lead all scorers with 11 points at the break.
The Nuggets closed the gap in the third quarter, outscoring Portland 12-2 to get within 73-72 on Lyles' basket. Denver was unable to pull in front.
TIP INS
Nuggets: Denver won the previous five games against the Blazers. ... Denver missed out on the playoffs for the past two seasons. ... Mason Plumlee fouled out with 1:38 left.
Trail Blazers: With his first 3-pointer, Lillard passed his franchise record of 229 3s set in the 2015-16 season. With his second, he reached 1,500 for his career. ... Portland went 8-2 without McCollum. ... Kanter had 11 points and 13 rebounds for his fourth double-double in five games.

In preparation for the playoffs, the 76ers rested all five starters, and star center Joel Embiid's status for the opener is in question. The third-seeded Sixers said the 7-foot center's achy left knee may prevent him from playing in the postseason opener this weekend against sixth-seeded Brooklyn.

PORTLAND, Ore. — Rookie Anfernee Simons scored a career-high 37 points in his first start of the season and the Portland Trail Blazers secured the No. 3 seed in the Western Conference with a dramatic 136-131 victory over the Sacramento Kings using just six players Wednesday night.
The Blazers have won 14 of 17 games en route to their sixth straight trip to the playoffs. Portland will open the postseason against the Oklahoma City Thunder, who finished in sixth.
Portland had already clinched homecourt advantage in the opening round with a 104-101 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers the night before.
Denver beat the Timberwolves 99-95 Wednesday night, locking the Nuggets into the No. 2 seed and a first-round series against San Antonio, and giving Portland the opening to claim the third seed. The Jazz secured the No. 4 seed and will play fifth-seeded Houston.
Portland trailed by 28 points during the second half but made it interesting in the fourth quarter by closing within 117-116 with 7:53 left on Simon's 3-pointer. Simons found Jake Layman for an alley-oop dunk to pull the Blazers in front.
Portland pushed the lead to 128-119 on Layman's basket with 2:49 left. Simons hit his seventh 3-pointer to make it 131-123 with just over two minutes left and Sacramento couldn't catch up.
Marvin Bagley III had 20 points to lead the Kings, who lost their 11th straight game in Portland.
Blazers coach Terry Stotts said before the game that guard CJ McCollum would rest because it was the second of a back-to-back. McCollum missed 10 games with a left knee injury and had just been back for Portland's last two games.
As for his other players, Stotts said going in that it was ""fluid."" Damian Lillard was available but did not play. Neither did any of the team's other regular starters, as Stotts went with Skal Labissiere, Layman, Meyers Leonard, Gary Trent, Jr. and Simons. Trent, Simons and Labissiere were making their first starts of the season.
""Our goal was to get homecourt, which we got. Whatever happens tonight, happens,"" Stotts said. ""If you overthink it, you get in trouble.""
The Kings' season is over, but coach Dave Joerger said he was encouraged.
""We haven't been great for the last couple of weeks, but I don't want that to dull the shine on what has been a terrific season of development and competitiveness, and competitive spirit, of laying down a foundation and an identity, a lot of success and a lot of good moments,"" Joerger said. ""I feel good about that, and I feel good about where we can be in the future.""
The Kings stayed with their regular starters and went up by 11 points in the opening quarter. They extended the lead to 26 points during the second and were up 87-62 at the break. Da'Aaron Fox led the Kings with 17 points and nine assists at halftime.
Joerger went to his reserves in the second half.
TIP-INS
Kings: Joerger was asked before the game why the Kings had not won in Portland since 2012. He replied: ""LaMarcus Aldridge, Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Wesley Matthews.""
Trail Blazers: Sacramento's 87 first-half points were the most Portland had allowed in the half this season. ... Simons became just the 11th rookie in franchise history to have a 30-point game.

Sacramento's season is over.

DENVER — Nikola Jokic scored 29 points and had a key strip in the closing seconds for the Denver Nuggets, who scored the game's final 15 points in a 99-95 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday night that secured the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference playoffs.
""We didn't give up,"" Jokic told the crowd after the Nuggets pulled out the improbable win to set up a first-round playoff series with the seventh-seeded San Antonio Spurs, instead of sixth-seeded Oklahoma City.
The Nuggets are in the postseason for the first time in six years.
Jamal Murray added 17 points, including the go-ahead 3-pointer with 31 seconds left that put Denver up 96-95. Jokic stripped Andrew Wiggins, who led the Timberwolves with 25 points, and then sank two free throws for a three-point cushion.
Wiggins' 3-pointer to tie it hit the front of the rim and the Nuggets got the ball back. Paul Millsap was fouled at the other end with 4.2 seconds remaining. He sank his first free throw and missed his second, but teammate Will Barton corralled the rebound and dribbled out the clock.
Gorgui Dieng added 18 points for the Timberwolves backups and rookie Cameron Reynolds scored a career-best 17 points, including a 3-pointer that put Minnesota ahead 95-84 with 4:01 left.
They wouldn't score again.
Jokic also pulled down 14 rebounds one night after his worst game of the year, one in which he scored just two points before fouling out in 16 minutes in a loss at Utah.
A year ago, these two teams met on the final day of the regular season with a lot more at stake. The Timberwolves won that one in overtime in the first final-day play-in game in the NBA in 21 years, ending a 14-year playoff absence and extending Denver's drought to six seasons.
Then, All-Star Jimmy Butler demanded a trade that torpedoed the Timberwolves, who fell to 36-46 and reverted to also-ran status while the Nuggets put together a 54-28 breakout for their first trip to the playoffs since 2012-13.
""Each one of our players deserves credit, because they've all bought in from Day 1,"" Malone said. ""And I think we've used that motivation of losing in Minneapolis last year Game 82 because coming up short two years in a row is really hard and it's kind of motivated us to be the team we are right now.""
TIP-INS:
Timberwolves: Minnesota played without starters Karl Anthony-Towns (right knee), Jeff Teague (left foot) and Robert Covington (right knee) and key reserves Taj Gibson (left calf) and Derrick Rose (right elbow).
Nuggets: Denver finished an NBA-best 34-7 at home. ... The Nuggets earned a No. 2 seed in the Western Conference playoffs for the sixth time in their history and for the first time since 2008-09, when they last won a playoff series, 4-1 over the Mavericks in the conference semifinals. They have lost their last five playoff series.
FIRST THINGS FIRST
The Timberwolves will make hiring a new president of basketball operations their first offseason priority. The fates of general manager Scott Layden and interim head coach Ryan Saunders have yet to be decided. Tom Thibodeau, who was fired Jan. 6, held the dual role of president of basketball operations and head coach.
""It really does not change anything for me one bit,"" Saunders said. ""When I accepted this post in early January, I approached it as I'm the head coach until they tell me I'm not the head coach. And that's how I continue to look at things moving forward.""
UP NEXT
Timberwolves: A search for a president, followed by decisions on Layden and Saunders.
Nuggets: A return to the playoffs after a six-year absence, facing the San Antonio Spurs in the first round.

CHICAGO — Jose Quintana struck out 11 in seven innings of four-hit ball and the Chicago Cubs blanked the Pittsburgh Pirates 2-0 on Thursday night.
Daniel Descalso and Victor Caratini each had two hits and an RBI in a game that was delayed 69 minutes by rain before the eighth.
Quintana (1-1) bounced back after being roughed up for eight runs and eight hits in three innings against Milwaukee in his first start of the season last Friday. It was the longest outing by a Chicago starter this season.
Steve Cishek pitched the eighth and Pedro Strop got three outs for his first save. The Cubs took two of three in their first home series after opening with a 2-7 road trip.
Pirates starter Joe Musgrove (1-1) allowed two unearned runs and four hits in 6 1/3 innings.
Because of severe storms predicted to move into the area late Thursday night, the Cubs pushed up the start of the game a half hour. The rain began as Chicago rallied for both runs in the seventh.
With one out, Jason Heyward lifted a pop fly to shallow left field and the strong right-to-left wind blew the ball toward the line. Because of a defensive shift, no Pittsburgh fielder had a clear shot at it. Three players converged and the ball hit off the glove of third baseman Jung Ho Kang in fair territory and fell in.
The play originally was called a double, but was quickly changed to an error on shortstop Erik Gonzalez.
Descalso followed with a single to drive in Heyward for the game's first run. Descalso went to second on the throw to the plate and scored when the next batter, Caratini, doubled to right-center.
By that point, a steady rain had begun. Shortly after the seventh inning ended, a bolt of lightning flashed in the distance beyond center field and the umpires stopped play.
EARLY EXIT
Chicago manager Joe Maddon was ejected in the bottom of the fifth by plate umpire Mike Estabrook for arguing balls and strikes.
With runners on first and second and one out, Caratini took a low breaking ball on a 3-1 pitch for a strike. After hearing complaints from the Cubs dugout, Estabrook took a few steps down the third base line and held up a hand, essentially saying that was enough.
Maddon walked out and slowly made his way to the home plate area. He was ejected almost immediately after speaking to Estabrook.
ROSTER MOVES
Pirates: INF Kevin Kramer was recalled from Triple-A Indianapolis to take the roster spot of SS Kevin Newman, who was placed on the 10-day injured list with a lacerated finger on his right hand.
Cubs: RHP Jen-Ho Tseng was released. The 24-year-old from Taiwan had been designated for assignment Saturday.
UP NEXT
Pirates: RHP Trevor Williams (1-0, 2.25 ERA) takes the mound Friday night in the opener of a three-game series at Washington. LHP Patrick Corbin (0-0, 3.75) starts for the Nationals.
Cubs: LHP Cole Hamels (1-0, 5.73 ERA) pitches the opener of a three-game home series against the Angles on Friday afternoon. LHP Tyler Skaggs (1-1, 2.45) goes for Los Angeles.

MIAMI — The last spot in the NBA playoffs went to the Detroit Pistons.
Their reward: A series against MVP candidate Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks.
The drama of the regular season went all the way to the very end of the regular season, with seven of the eight first-round playoff matchups not being clinched until the final night was in the books — the last three of them, out West, going down to literally the final moments.
The two-time defending champion Golden State Warriors will start their quest for a fourth title in five years against the Los Angeles Clippers.
""It's not going to be as easy as people think it is,"" Warriors star Kevin Durant said.
That's the beauty of the playoffs. It's not supposed to be easy.
First-round games in all eight series will be played starting Saturday and Sunday. The second round cannot begin until April 27 at the earliest, the conference finals couldn't start before May 12 and the NBA Finals will start on May 30.
EASTERN CONFERENCE
The only matchup in the NBA that was set before Wednesday night was No. 4 Boston against No. 5 Indiana.
Everything else, just like all the West matchups, fell into place during Game 82s on Wednesday.
The Bucks, the NBA's top overall seed, play the Pistons. No. 2 Toronto draws No. 7 Orlando, with the Magic in the postseason for the first time since 2012. And No. 3 Philadelphia — a team wrapped in intrigue right now — will face No. 6 Brooklyn.
Joel Embiid played in only 10 of the 76ers' 24 games since the All-Star break, and general manager Elton Brand told reporters Wednesday that ""it is possible"" the team's best scorer and rebounder won't be ready to start the playoffs.
Embiid isn't the only injury situation that made headlines Wednesday: The Celtics announced that Marcus Smart will miss four to six weeks with an injury to his left oblique — a massive blow to Boston.
WESTERN CONFERENCE
Portland rallied from 28 points down on Wednesday against Sacramento — which blew a lead that large for the second time this season.
Denver finished on a 15-0 run to beat Minnesota.
And with that, the West bracket was shaken up one last time before it was finally set.
Top-seeded Golden State will face the eighth-seeded Clippers, a matchup that was known after early results Wednesday. The rest went right down to the wire, with No. 2 Denver facing No. 7 San Antonio, No. 3 Portland getting No. 6 Oklahoma City and No. 4 Houston facing No. 5 Utah. It was a worst-case for Houston, which entered the season's final night in place to finish second, third or fourth in the West.
The way the results fell means the Rockets, if they get past the Jazz, would likely see the Warriors in the second round — and not in the Western Conference finals. So there will be no rematch of last year's title series out West, a tussle where the Rockets had a 3-2 series lead before Chris Paul's hamstring balked and the Warriors went on to advance and reach the NBA Finals.
The Nuggets clinched the No. 2 seed with their big rally to top the Timberwolves. The Blazers got to the No. 3 spot with their wild comeback to beat the Kings. The combination of those results dropped Houston to the No. 4 seed.
SATURDAY SCHEDULE
All times Eastern
Brooklyn at Philadelphia, 2:30 p.m.
Orlando at Toronto, 5 p.m.
L.A. Clippers at Golden State, 8 p.m.
San Antonio at Denver, 10:30 p.m.
SUNDAY SCHEDULE
All times Eastern
Indiana at Boston, 1 p.m.
Oklahoma City at Portland, 3:30 p.m.
Detroit at Milwaukee, 7 p.m.
Utah at Houston, 9:30 p.m.
SCORING MARK
NBA teams averaged 111.2 points this season, the 11th-highest mark in league history.
It's also the highest scoring clip in the league since 1970-71.
Records were set for 3-pointers made and attempted for the seventh straight season, along with total points for the fifth time in the last six years. NBA teams scored 273,573 points this season, fueled by new rules that allowed offenses more freedom of movement, a league-wide commitment to playing at a faster pace — and the still-growing love affair with the 3-pointer.
In the 2012-13 season, NBA teams averaged 20 attempts from 3-point range — which was a record at that time. This season, they averaged 32 attempted 3s per game.
FAREWELL
A pair of legends played for the final time Wednesday night — and went out in style.
Dwyane Wade had a triple-double for Miami at Brooklyn, 25 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists. Dirk Nowitzki had 20 points and 10 rebounds for Dallas at San Antonio.
The Heat and Mavericks both lost, which was irrelevant to both clubs. The nights were about Wade and Nowitzki, both All-Stars this season.

BOSTON — Chris Sale let a Toronto runner steal home, Mookie Betts fanned with two on for the final out and the champion Boston Red Sox stumbled again, losing to the Blue Jays 7-5 Tuesday in their home opener.
After getting their World Series rings that had 185 diamonds, rubies and sapphires during a ceremony that included the Super Bowl champ New England Patriots, the Red Sox fell to 3-9. A return to Fenway Park failed to shake the doldrums that plagued Boston during a season-opening, 11-game trip to Seattle, Oakland and Arizona.
Red Sox sparkplug Dustin Pedroia went 1 for 4 in his first major league game since May. He played only three times last year while slowed by a knee injury.
The game also made history: It was the first big league matchup of managers born in Puerto Rico, with Toronto's Charlie Montoyo topping Boston's Alex Cora.
Lourdes Gurriel Jr. stole home and had an RBI single as Toronto ended a four-game losing streak. Freddy Galvis drove in two runs to back Matt Shoemaker (3-0), who allowed two earned runs in 5 2/3 innings.
Sale (0-3) never seemed comfortable and surrendered five runs and seven hits before being pulled after four innings. His velocity has been down this season — his fastball averaged 91.8 mph in this outing — and he has a 9.00 ERA after three starts.
Sale's day hit a low point in the fourth, after Danny Jansen scored on a passed ball. Gurriel kept extending his lead off third as Sale went into a full windup, then broke for the plate. Gurriel easily scored when Sale's pitch was wide and went to the backstop, making it 5-2.
Mitch Moreland and Betts each had home runs for the Red Sox, who got within 6-5 on a two-out RBI double by Xander Bogaerts in the eighth.
The Red Sox put their first two batters on base in the ninth against Ken Giles. But pinch-hitter Blake Swihart and Andrew Benintendi flied out and, with most of the crowd standing on a chilly afternoon and chanting for Betts, the AL MVP struck out and gave Giles his third save.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Blue Jays: C Luke Maile and INF Justin Smoak both sat with neck issues. Smoak missed two of Toronto's three games in Cleveland last week due to the issue, which appeared again before the series finale.
Red Sox: Cora said LHP Brian Johnson (left elbow inflammation) went through some testing and that the injury is not as bad as originally thought. ""At one point, we thought it was the end of the season. It's not that,"" Cora said. But there is still no timetable for his return
CHAMPIONSHIP CELEBRATION
The Red Sox pulled out all the stops to celebrate their latest title.
While being serenaded by the Boston Pops orchestra giving a rendition of Queen's ""We Are the Champions,"" a giant banner honoring the 2018 champions was unfurled in front of the Green Monster.
Pedro Martinez, Mike Lowell and David Ortiz carried out the 2004, '07 and '13 trophies. Then the 2018 team began filing down the red carpet to collect the championship rings. Cora led the coaching staff and David Price was the first player to receive one.
Also taking part in the ceremony were former Red Sox Manny Ramirez and Curt Schilling, who have been absent from previous ceremonies.
MILESTONE
Cora and Montoyo became the first pair of Puerto Rican-born managers to face each other in a major league game.
Cora said it is yet another promising milestone for managers with Puerto Rican ties getting opportunities in Major League Baseball. Nationals manager Dave Martinez was born in New York to Puerto Rican parents.
""At one point before I got hired here we had no Puerto Rican managers,"" Cora said. ""And all of a sudden we have three out of 30. That's a pretty good rate.""

SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Ian Clark scored 31 points with a career-best seven 3-pointers, Elfrid Payton had 12 of his 25 points in the final 3½ minutes and the New Orleans Pelicans beat the Sacramento Kings 133-129 on Sunday night.
Jahlil Okafor added 23 points and 14 rebounds, Solomon Hill had 13 points and Kenrich Williams scored 12 to help the Pelicans stop a three-game skid while beating the Kings for the third time in four meetings this season.
Harrison Barnes scored 29 points for Sacramento in its final home game. De'Aaron Fox added 24 points and 11 assists, while Marvin Bagley had 19 points and 14 rebounds.
New Orleans led by 16 in the third quarter but Sacramento came back to tie it, then went up 117-115 midway through the fourth.
Bogdan Bogdanovic and Barnes made consecutive 3s to put the Kings ahead 123-121. Payton then scored on a short jumper and made a 3-pointer.
The Pelicans led 132-126 following a pair of free throws by Payton with 26.5 seconds remaining. Bogdanovic made another 3 but later airballed an attempt from beyond the arc. Buddy Hield also missed a late 3-pointer for the Kings.
Hield finished with 12 points and made two 3s, giving him 599 in his first three NBA seasons. That matches the mark set by Portland's Damian Lillard.
By taking three of four from Sacramento, the Pelicans prevented the Kings from celebrating their first 40-win season at home since 2005-06. Sacramento (39-42) can still reach 40 wins by beating Portland on the road Wednesday.
The Kings got off to a good start but couldn't hold off the Pelicans in the second half.
Nemanja Bjelica was perfect on five shots in the first quarter and had 12 points. Fox added 10 to help offset four 3s by Clark in the opening period.
The Kings led by 14 before Clark led a late charge in the second quarter to pull the Pelicans to 68-66.
TIP-INS
Pelicans: With Julius Randle getting the night off for rest, New Orleans was left with a three-man bench. Christian Wood started in place of Randle.
Kings: Bagley's double-double was his 19th this season. . Coach Dave Joerger picked up a technical foul at the end of the third, his eighth this season. . Sacramento closed the third quarter on a 22-6 run, not long after allowing the Pelicans to go on a 20-5 spurt.

(Reuters) - Brighton and Hove Albion midfielders Solly March and Pascal Gross face late fitness tests to be in contention for Saturday's Premier League game against Bournemouth, manager Chris Hughton said on Thursday.
March picked up a calf injury in Brighton's 3-0 loss at Chelsea that forced him out of last Saturday's 1-0 FA Cup semi-final defeat by Manchester City but the 24-year-old has since returned to training.
Germany's Gross has featured 19 times in the league this season but has not played since the end of February due to a hamstring problem.
""Solly March missed a bit of training today. Pascal Gross also trained today but of course, he's been out for a while now so decisions on them will be made either today or tomorrow,"" Hughton told a news conference.
Brighton, who are 16th in the table with 33 points, are hoping to end a run of two straight league defeats and steer themselves away from the relegation battle.
""Nobody knows a points total that will keep us safe. Our attitude has to be to keep fighting and getting as many results as we can between now and the end of the season,"" Hughton added.
""The group felt good about our performance (against City) last weekend. To run a top class side fairly close speaks volumes for this group of players.""

AUGUSTA, Ga. — Despite having won three of the last six majors he contested Brooks Koepka was not on many Green Jacket radar screens when he arrived at Augusta National this year.
He is now.
A golfer who prefers to let his play do his talking, Koepka delivered a bogey free six-under 66 that was highlighted by a back nine charge featuring four successive birdies to grab a share of the first round lead alongside Bryson DeChambeau.
While DeChambeau, nicknamed the professor, is seen as the brains of the PGA Tour the muscular Koepka is viewed as the brawn having used to spend hours in the weight room.
Koepka, however, has recently cut back on his gym time and paid more attention to his diet.
His weight loss coincided with an equally noticeable drop in form that saw the 28-year-old slip into a pre-Masters slump, missing the cut at the Arnold Palmer and finishing outside the top 55 at both the Players Championship and WGC Dell Match Play.
""I lift too many weights and I'm too big to play golf and then when I lose weight, I'm too small,"" said Koepka. ""I don't know what to say. I'm too big and I'm too small.
""I don't care what anybody else says. I'm doing it for me, and obviously it seems to work.""
Playing in the last group, Koepka was back to his imposing and intimidating self having what he described as the best ball striking round he has ever had at a major championship.
While Koepka has found it difficult to earn the recognition he feels he deserves there is no denying he is a golfer built for the big stage.
Of his five PGA Tour wins, three have been at majors.
After watching last year's Masters from his couch recovering from a wrist injury, Koepka has returned a major monster successfully defending his U.S. Open crown last year and winning the 2018 PGA Championship.
""I get to whatever major championship it is and just when I arrive there, I just get a good feeling,"" said Koepka.
""I don't know how to explain it. I'm just dialled in and I'm focused the entire week.
""I keep pretty much the same routine for all the majors.
""I just enjoy the big stage. I enjoy major championships that's what you're remembered by.""

UNIONDALE, N.Y. — The Islanders supposedly left postseason mayhem at Nassau Coliseum behind four years ago with a Game 6, first-round win against Coach Barry Trotz and his Capitals. Farewells to Long Island were declared after the team lost its next game, in Washington, to end an era — or so fans and players surmised.
Fast forward to 2019, and the Islanders have found their way home, at least part time, to their former and relentlessly raucous original arena after three-plus seasons at Barclays Center in Brooklyn. And a 103-point finish with Trotz now behind their bench earned the Islanders home ice in a playoff series for the first time since 1988, two years before their captain, Anders Lee, was born.
Thunderous cascades of sound again filled the old-school Coliseum on Wednesday night during Game 1 against the Pittsburgh Penguins.
Three times, the home crowd went wild for Islanders goals in regulation, and it was deafening when Josh Bailey scored 4 minutes 39 seconds into overtime to lift the Islanders to a 4-3 victory. Game 2 is Friday night at the Coliseum.
It was a fitting goal for Bailey, 29, an Islander for his entire 11-year N.H.L. career. He narrowly missed scoring with five seconds left in the third period when his redirection hit the post behind Penguins goaltender Matt Murray. In overtime, the speedy 21-year-old Mathew Barzal, in his postseason debut, backhanded the puck off the post before Bailey swept the rebound past Murray.
“Scoring an overtime winner in the playoffs is stuff you dream about as a kid,” Bailey said. “It’s a good feeling, but that being said, you have to turn the page and get ready for the next one.”
[
N.H.L. playoffs: first-round schedule and results
]
Bailey joined the Islanders as a 19-year-old in 2008-9 after they selected him ninth over all in the 2008 draft. He arrived a year before the Isles selected John Tavares at No. 1. The face of the franchise for nine years, Tavares is gone now, starting instead for the Toronto Maple Leafs this postseason.
Bailey is signed through 2023-24, and his 797 games played is sixth in franchise history. Skating in the playoffs for the fourth time, Bailey clearly relished the sensation of whipping the home crowd into a frenzy.
“That’s a big reason why we play hockey right there,” said Bailey, who is from Bowmanville, Ontario, about an hour’s drive northeast of Toronto. “We expected it to be an intense game, and it was.”
Fans in one of the upper sections of Nassau Coliseum have long serenaded Bailey to the theme of the
DJ Ötzi version
of the Bruce Channel song “Hey! Baby.” Words are changed to “Hey, Josh Bailey! — Ooo! Ahh! We wanna know! Will you score a goal?”
As jubilant Islanders followers headed for the Coliseum exits on Wednesday night, they sang the altered lyrics and waved orange playoff towels. That was after they practically drowned out Bailey’s on-ice postgame interview with their voices, all part of the atmosphere at an arena many Islanders fans never really wanted the team to leave in the first place.
After a career-best 71 points last season, Bailey continued his solid play this season under Trotz, with 16 goals and 56 points, the third straight season he reached at least 40 assists.
Bailey wasn’t the only player to hear his name chanted by the home crowd. Goalie Robin Lehner,
in his first season with the Islanders
, earned the first playoff win of his career, making 41 saves, in only his third career playoff game and first since 2013.
“It was amazing as always,” Lehner said. “This is special. I don’t understand how they can scream for that long. But good for them. Good for them.”
A little more than a year ago, Lehner had a panic attack during a game with the Buffalo Sabres. He later entered the league’s substance abuse recovery program and also learned he had bipolar disorder.
This season, he and Thomas Greiss shared the Jennings Trophy, which is given to the goalies on the team that allowed the fewest goals. Lehner won a career-high 25 games and had a 2.13 goals-against average.
Wednesday’s game had everything to be expected from playoff hockey — the kind of April tempest the Islanders and Penguins exhibited in 2013, when Pittsburgh won a hard-fought series in six games. Postwhistle scrums were common. Hard hits drove opponents into the boards and skate blade stops near the crease seemed to produce higher waves of ice shavings to annoy goaltenders.
The Islanders’ demeanor mirrors their coach’s, and the approach worked against the Penguins, whom Trotz is meeting for a fourth consecutive postseason. His Capitals lost to the Penguins in 2016 and 2017 when Pittsburgh won the Stanley Cup before the Capitals finally upended the Penguins in last year’s second round on the way to winning the Cup.
Trotz was proud of the Islanders’ performance and effort heading into Game 2.
“They didn’t flinch at all, which is good,” Trotz said. “In close games, we’ve learned to be comfortable, and there are going to be close games in the playoffs.”

NEW YORK — Lenny Dykstra has sued one-time New York Mets teammate Ron Darling, St. Martin's Press and Macmillan Publishing Group over a passage in the pitcher's new book accusing the outfielder of directing racist comments toward Boston pitcher Oil Can Boyd during the 1986 World Series.
Dykstra, sentenced seven years ago to prison on both federal and California state charges, filed suit Tuesday in New York Supreme Court in Manhattan alleging defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
Darling's ""108 Stitches: Loose Threads, Ripping Yarns, and the Darndest Characters from My Time in the Game"" was published April 2 by St. Martin's Press, which is part of Macmillan.
Darling wrote Dykstra was ""one of baseball's all-time thugs"" and was in the on-deck circle at Boston's Fenway Park before Game 3 of the 1986 World Series while Boyd warmed up ""shouting every imaginable and unimaginable insult and expletive in his direction — foul, racist, hateful, hurtful stuff."" Darling went on to call it ""the worst collection of taunts and insults I'd ever heard — worse, I'm betting, than anything Jackie Robinson might have heard, his first couple times around the league.""
Dykstra's lawsuit called Darling's account a ""fictional portrayal"" and ""false and self-serving.""
""No such racist tirade ever occurred,"" the lawsuit said.
Darling, a 58-year-old SNY broadcaster, declined comment before the Mets' game against Minnesota on Tuesday night. Tracey Guest of St. Martin's Press did not respond to an email seeking comment.
Dykstra, now 56, was sentenced to three years in a California state prison in March 2012 by Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Cynthia Ulfig after pleading no contest to grand theft auto and providing a false financial statement. He was sentenced to 6 1/2 months in prison that December by U.S. District Judge Dean D. Pregerson after Dykstra pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles to bankruptcy fraud, concealment of assets and money laundering. The sentences were to be served concurrently.

The NHL has suspended defenseman Slava Voynov for the 2019-20 season and 2020 playoffs after determining he committed acts of domestic violence.
Commissioner Gary Bettman suspended Voynov on Tuesday for what the league called unacceptable off-ice conduct. The 29-year-old Russian could have his eligibility restored on July 1, 2020, based on good behavior.
Voynov was suspended indefinitely in October 2014 after being arrested for domestic abuse. He pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor, left the United States to go back to Russia and in July had the conviction dismissed by a judge in Los Angeles county.
Bettman said he determined after a league investigation and a March 21 hearing that Voynov engaged in acts of domestic violence against his wife.
Voynov's agent, Rolland Hedges, did not immediately return a voicemail and text message seeking comment.

The crush of bodies surrounding Dwyane Wade as he left an N.B.A. court for the last time as an active player had the effect of a small tidal wave, surging through the jammed Barclays Center tunnel, head-on into a pack of waiting well-wishers.
At the rear of the crowd stood Pat Riley, who brought Wade to Miami 16 years ago, nurtured him to stardom, celebrated three championships with him, let him get away in 2016 over a contract dispute and less than two years later welcomed him home with open arms.
“Whoa,” Riley said, hands on the shoulders of his wife, Chris, steadying her against the swell of humanity.
Now here, finally, came Wade, man of the hour. Wade and Riley, both standing 6 feet 4 inches, made eye contact. Riley raised his right arm forward. Wade reached above the security detail, clasping his hand with the team president’s. The linchpins of the Miami Heat franchise pulled together for a heartfelt embrace.
“One more,” Riley told Wade. “I’ve got a max contract for you.”
Wade snickered. Riley chortled. It was the self-mocking joke Riley could tell and they both could enjoy after Wade, having gone home again following unfulfilling detours to Chicago and Cleveland, was given the send-off he deserved.
After being traded back to Miami by the Cavaliers early last year, Wade talked himself into a last dance for the 2018-19 season, many nights of which he played younger than his well-worn 37 years. Properly feted before Miami’s home schedule closeout on Tuesday night, he scored 30 points in a victory over Philadelphia and topped it off with a playful triple double (25 points, 11 rebounds, 10 assists) as the Heat’s season ended 24 hours later with a 113-94 defeat to the playoff-bound Nets.
“I can retire and be happy about my career,” Wade would say, sporting a gold and black jacket in the interview room, on his way out to dance the night away with a guest list that included his N.B.A. “brotherhood” — LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony and Chris Paul.
However dapper at 74, with a fine head of combed-back gray hair, Riley was never part of that social scene, just the patriarch who landed Wade with the fifth pick of the 2003 draft, considered at the time to be a consolation prize after James, Darko Milicic, Anthony and Chris Bosh were the first four players chosen.
But Wade was more special than anyone imagined during his time at Marquette, a world-class gymnast in basketball footwear, with the uncommon calm of a cocksure gunslinger.
When Wade had moved on into the corridor leading to the locker room, I told Riley about a 2005 playoff night in Auburn Hills, Mich., when Wade, as a second-year player, was making life quite difficult for the defending champion, defensively stout Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference finals.
Taking a halftime stroll, I ran into Chuck Daly, who as the Pistons coach in the late 1980s had devised a defense specifically for Michael Jordan — the famous Jordan Rules.
“I’ll tell you what, he’s got some Jordan in him,” Daly said, dragging on a cigarette, when I asked what he thought of the young Wade. “He’s got all the things you can’t teach.”
Riley nodded. “Chuck was right,” he said.
Wade had other elite qualities besides the balletic ability to score from angles we couldn’t be sure actually existed. He could pass like a point guard when his team needed an assist. He was a solid team defender. He retires as the most productive shot-blocking guard in N.B.A. history, having last month nudged past Jordan.
Flashy as he was, Wade had some Tim Duncan in him, too. Until James arrived with Bosh in the summer of 2010, he was unquestionably the franchise star without having to broadcast it to the world, and his door was open to anyone who could give him a better chance to win.
Wade embraced Riley’s 2004 acquisition of Shaquille O’Neal when Kobe Bryant wanted no part of the big fella in Los Angeles. He recruited James while fully aware of how the self-proclaimed King was great at basketball, as well as sucking the oxygen out of an organization.
When James departed after two titles and four consecutive runs to the finals, Riley called it the most devastating blow of his time in Miami, but Wade insisted there were no hard feelings. It was business. He was still being paid to play basketball, live in Miami. How could life not be good?
Yet he wasn’t immune to wounded pride when Riley refused to give him a third contract year in 2016, citing Wade’s balky knees and declining stats. Wade left, reluctantly, one more divorce in a league of ever-transient stars.
There’s nothing wrong, nothing at all, with players maximizing free agency, leveraging their way to whichever location suits them at a certain career stage. James of course has been the pied piper of the paradigm. Kevin Durant is reportedly poised to again follow his lead, right out of Golden State.
But James’s presence in Brooklyn on Wednesday night, a convenient excuse to avoiding dealing with Magic Johnson’s sudden, stunning disappearance from the Lakers’ front office, was a reminder that the more moves a player makes, the better the odds he might eventually outmaneuver himself.
Meanwhile, Dirk Nowitzki, like Wade, was also demonstrating the currency in continuity, finishing a 21-year run Wednesday night with the Dallas Mavericks to widespread acclaim. Manu Ginobili and Duncan were similarly deified for staying the course in San Antonio. Wade will remain the toast of South Florida.
In the Miami locker room, a few young Heat players lined up for Wade to sign their jerseys and sneakers. The No. 3 jersey he wore was given to Anthony, a shooter without a squad after parting ways with Paul’s Houston Rockets this season after a mere 10 games.
Anthony did manage to scoop up a ball rolling out of bounds in the fourth quarter by the corner front row from where he, Paul and James were cheering on Wade. He took one dribble and, thankfully, resisted the temptation.
“I didn’t get a chance to play against Melo this season and exchange jerseys,” said Wade, explaining the gesture. “He was the missing piece.”
Throughout his career, wherever he lit up the scoreboard, Anthony seemed to miss the point, unwilling to — as former President Barack Obama said of Wade in a video tribute — “sometimes sacrifice your ego in pursuit of a title.”
If Anthony never plays again in the N.B.A., is there a moral to their divergent stories? Only if the most graceful departure possible is a priority, part of the plan. It apparently was for Wade. He left with a self-assured smile and, while indicating he would probably need therapy to deal with the time on his hands, he ruled out a potential return.
“I think everybody knows this is for real,” he said.

NEW YORK — Mario Hezonja scored a career-high 30 points and made the go-ahead 3-pointer with 44 seconds left, and the New York Knicks beat the Washington Wizards at home for the first time in six years with a 113-110 victory Sunday night.
Luke Kornet added 17 points and Kevin Knox had 16 for the Knicks (16-64), who would have tied the franchise record with a 65th loss had they not rallied from a 10-point deficit after three quarters.
They had lost nine straight at Madison Square Garden to the Wizards since their last victory on April 9, 2013, but Hezonja brought New York back with some big plays in the final period.
Starting again at point guard, he added six rebounds and five assists.
Jeff Green had 19 points and Thomas Bryant scored 17 for the Wizards (32-49), who need to beat Boston on Tuesday in their final game to avoid a 50-loss season.
Hezonja's 3-pointer made it 111-110, and the Knicks got the ball back when Sam Dekker lost it out of bounds. Hezonja hit two free throws for the final margin.
New York has to win its last two games to avoid at least matching its 17-65 mark under Derek Fisher in 2014-15.
Washington led 56-52 at halftime but New York took a 68-67 lead on Hezonja's follow shot with 7:41 remaining in the third. The Wizards ran off the next 13 points to go ahead 80-68 on Bobby Portis' 3-pointer about three minutes later, and they took an 89-79 lead to the fourth.
New York made its first five 3s in the final quarter and charged back to take a 106-103 lead on Mitchell Robinson's free throws with 2:20 to play.
TIP-INS
Wizards: Bradley Beal scored 13 points, going 5 of 17 and landing hard after a dunk in the first half. ... Jordan McRae sat out with a sore left Achilles tendon.
Knicks: Dennis Smith Jr. played despite back soreness, coming off the bench to score 15 points after missing the previous three games. ... Coach David Fizdale isn't sure if guards Allonzo Trier (left calf) and Kadeem Allen (concussion) will return this season.
WHAT IF?
Washington coach Scott Brooks said it's hard not to look at the Eastern Conference, where a winning record wasn't required to secure a playoff berth, and think the Wizards should've been there.
""Every year you go down, 'OK, we came up short on that game, we should've won that game.' You can list off a bunch of games. I've always done that. When we won 60 games in OKC we did the same thing,"" Brooks said.
""There's definitely opportunity the way the East is this year. There might be three teams right at .500 — 6, 7, 8. But can't worry about that now. We've got to move forward and during a tough season a lot of good things happened.""
NO PROBLEM, HOUSTON
Fizdale wasn't concerned with Rockets starters leaving the bench before the Knicks' loss in Houston had ended on Friday, saying he didn't know their reasons for doing so and didn't need them to explain it to him.
""I've got a game today,"" he said. ""I've got the Wizards.""

AMSTERDAM — Cristiano Ronaldo produced yet another quality goal to add to his collection and help Juventus to a 1-1 draw at Ajax Amsterdam in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final tie on Wednesday.
Juventus took the lead on the stroke of halftime as Portuguese forward Ronaldo began an attacking move inside his own half before sprinting down field and diving to head in a clever chip from Joao Cancelo.
""Ronaldo proved again he is from a different level, the timing of his player is so different from the others,"" said an admiring Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri.
Ajax equalised 30 seconds into the second half after Cancelo lost control of the ball to allow David Neres to run down the left wing, cut inside and curl the ball past Juve goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny.
The result leaves the Serie A side in a strong position to advance to the semi-finals in next week's return leg in Turin. However, they will be mindful of Ajax's 4-1 away win over Real Madrid in the last round that eliminated the holders 5-3 on aggregate.
Hakim Ziyech had several efforts at goal in a lively start for the youthful Dutch team, who have come through the pre-group phase qualifying round to reach the last eight.
Donny van de Beek scraped the outside of the upright with a 25th minute effort from close range after opening up space for himself in the penalty area in Ajax's best chance of the first half.
But Juventus, with the 34-year-old Ronaldo central to their attacks, worked their way into the contest and came close themselves when the forward set up Federico Bernardeschi to turn and shoot in the 37th minute. But he was just off target.
Ronaldo, who scored a hat-trick in the previous round against Atletico Madrid, then scored a 125th Champions League goal with the last move of the first half.
""He is a predator in the box. He waited for a gap and then sprinted past two players,"" conceded Ajax's teenage captain Matthijs de Ligt.
PENALTY CLAIM
After equalising, Ajax then dominated possession but were guilty of over-elaborate passing and were also fortunate not to have given away a penalty when defender Nicolas Tagliafico was tugging on the jersey of Juventus captain Mario Mandzukic.
Spanish referee Carlos del Cerro Grande paused briefly in the 53rd minute to presumably hear from the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) but resumed play before TV replays showed that Juventus had been denied a decent claim.
Tagliafico will miss the second leg next Tuesday after being booked late in the first half.
Juve hit the upright in the closing stages through substitute Douglas Costa although Ajax could have had the last say as Dusan Tadic missed a good chance in stoppage time.
""A 1-1 score is not what we had hoped for but we are still well in,"" said Ajax coach Erik ten Hag. ""We had a lot of patient possession and we created one or two good chances.""
More than 100 Juventus supporters were detained by Dutch police before the match while home fans were also arrested as a water cannon was used outside the ground.

SYDNEY — ACT Brumbies coach Dan McKellar says David Pocock's workload will be carefully managed when he makes his return from injury with the Wallabies loose forward looking set to face the Lions in Super Rugby this weekend.
The 30-year-old flanker has not played since the loss to the Rebels on March 8 after suffering a calf injury and also missed his team's second game after being concussed in the first six minutes of the opening match of the season.
""You have to manage him,"" McKellar told reporters in Canberra on Thursday. ""Calf injuries ... they can be tricky and hang around a while so we have to manage his load well.
""He's not going to play 80 minutes. That would be silly from our end. We're just going to manage him wisely and make sure he can string some games together.""
McKellar added the conservative approach was necessary because the more Pocock played, the greater benefit to the Brumbies and the Wallabies heading into this year's Rugby World Cup.
""It would be nice for him to get some consistency week in week out and build his performance,"" the 42-year-old added.
""Even if you're a world class player, if you're in one week then out for a few more it's hard to get momentum in your own individual performance.""
Pocock is considered crucial to Wallabies coach Michael Cheika's plans for the global showpiece in Japan later this year but has been under something of an injury cloud over the last 12 months.
He missed two tests last year due to a neck injury and has suffered several concussions with both Brumbies and Wallabies management stating they were concerned opposition were targeting his head and neck to nullify his effect at the breakdown.
Pocock cancelled an annual holiday to Zimbabwe last December to try and sort out the lingering neck pain with an eye on the World Cup.
While Pocock was a boon to the team off the field with his leadership and experience, McKellar said he was ""just keen to get back on the field"".
""It has been a frustrating couple of weeks,"" said McKellar, who added his side would likely be at full strength on Saturday in Canberra.
""The guys who were rested last week (against the Canterbury Crusaders) will come back in.
""(Scott) Sio, (James) Slipper and Rory Arnold they've had their rostered week off so they'll be back into it this week.""

BOSTON — The Boston Red Sox are celebrating their fourth World Series title in 15 years at Fenway Park before their home opener.
A giant banner honoring the 2018 champions was unfurled in front of the Green Monster during a ceremony before Tuesday's game against the Toronto Blue Jays. Pedro Martinez, Mike Lowell and David Ortiz carried out the 2004, '07 and '13 trophies. The Boston Pops orchestra set up in shallow right field to play Queen's ""We Are the Champions.""
Then the 2018 team began filing down the red carpet to collect the championship rings. Alex Cora led the coaching staff and David Price was the first player to receive one.
Also taking part in the ceremony were former Red Sox Manny Ramirez and Curt Schilling, who have been absent from previous ceremonies.

MILWAUKEE — Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 30 points and Khris Middleton added 21 to send Milwaukee to a methodical 115-107 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Sunday night, giving the Bucks 60 wins in a season for the first time since 1981.
The Bucks, who have clinched the best record in the Eastern Conference, led from the outset as the Hawks rested leading scorers John Collins and Trae Young.
Milwaukee led 85-72 entering the final period, but Atlanta pulled to 101-98 on a drive by DeAndre' Bembry with 3:28 left.
Middleton countered with consecutive 3-pointers and Antetokounmpo connected from beyond the arc to put Milwaukee up 110-98.
Alex Len had a career-high 33 points for Atlanta, including six 3-pointers.
None of the Bucks' starters played more than 27 minutes and 11 of 12 available players each logged at least 19 minutes.
Milwaukee led 28-21 after one quarter and pushed it to 46-30 before the Hawks trimmed it to 54-45 at halftime.
Vince Carter hit two free throws to cap a 10-point run that pulled Atlanta to 78-71, but the Bucks pushed the lead to 85-72 entering the fourth.
Milwaukee, which lost in the first round of the playoffs each of the last two seasons, has not advanced past the opening round since making the Eastern Conference finals in 2001.
The 1980-81 Bucks team that finished 60-22 under coach Don Nelson included Sidney Moncrief, Marques Johnson, Junior Bridgeman and Bob Lanier.
TIP-INS
Hawks: Young (19.1 points per game), who had started all 80 games, and John Collins (19.5 ppg) did not play due to load management. ""We figured today would be a good day to sit them and finish the season on a high note at home,"" coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""That's really important for us as a team and with what we've been through this year.""
Bucks: Antetokounmpo, who did not play in Saturday's 133-128 loss to the Nets because of left calf soreness, was questionable for this one. But he was back in the lineup after experiencing no setbacks during pregame warmups.

TAMPA, Fla. — Baylor and Notre Dame capped the women's college basketball season with a thrilling championship game.
The sport now has had a different champion in the past four years with the Lady Bears edging the Irish 82-81 on Sunday night to win their third title. It's only the second time in the past two decades that there have been that many teams claiming the title.
""Just a great game for women's basketball,"" Baylor coach Kim Mulkey said.
The 11-point combined differential for the three games in the Final Four was the closest in the history of the tournament, topping last season's 15-point margin. More than 40,000 fans attended the Final Four games, which was the most since 2010. Overall, nearly 275,000 fans attended the entire tournament, which ranks eighth all-time, including 20,127 for the title game. It was the highest attendance in over 15 years for the NCAAs.
""We've had a really great championship. Our first- and second-round numbers is the best we've seen in 11 years,"" NCAA vice president for women's basketball Lynn Holzman said.
There were a number of competitive games in the entire tournament, including Sunday night's title tilt. During the regular season, the Top 25 was upset and three different teams held the No. 1 spot in the poll, including Baylor, which was the most since 2012.
While 12 of the 15 players on the AP All-American teams will not be returning, the future is still bright with plenty of star power coming back.
Oregon Ducks junior Sabrina Ionescu announced Saturday night that she was going to return for her senior season. She potentially could have gone to the WNBA this year.
Notre Dame guard Jackie Young hasn't revealed her intentions yet. Like Ionescu, the junior turns 22 this year which makes her eligible for the WNBA draft.
Baylor forward Lauren Cox will be back at some point next year. She injured her left knee in the title game in the third quarter. Mulkey made it sound like Cox could miss at least some of next season because of the injury.
""That kid, if she didn't get hurt, and she will be back, God works in mysterious ways, would have been the No. 1 probably pick in the draft next year,"" Mulkey said. ""That kid probably would have been defensive player of the year nationally next year. That's how good she is. And she will be back, I promise you that. It may take her a year. We'll rest her, do whatever.""

BERLIN — Borussia Dortmund will look to stay in touch with leaders Bayern Munich and recover from last week's heavy loss when they take on Mainz 05 on Saturday, with top scorer Paco Alcacer returning from injury to boost their frontline.
Dortmund were crushed 5-0 by Bayern on Saturday and dropped a point behind the champions in the standings. Bayern are on 64 points and Dortmund on 63 with six games left to play.
Dortmund coach Lucien Favre, whose team have been far from convincing with two stoppage-time wins and a defeat in their last three matches, is likely to slot Alcacer back in.
The Spaniard, who has netted 16 times in the league, missed the crucial Bayern game through an arm injury but was back in team training on Wednesday.
American Christian Pulisic, who is recovering from a muscle injury he picked up on international duty, was also back training with the ball while Portugal's Raphael Guerreiro did some light running again.
Defender Abdou Diallo was also back to fitness, Dortmund said.
""The most important thing is to win the next game,"" said defender Manuel Akanji.
For Dortmund, there was no other result that will keep their title hopes alive and keep them in the running for their first league title in eight years.
The Bavarians are on a high after their big win over Dortmund, which helped them recapture top spot, as they look to earn a seventh record-extending Bundesliga title and make up for their Champions League round of 16 exit.
They had an injury scare when Corentin Tolisso, who had missed much of the season after a ligament tear on the third matchday, was carried off the training pitch on Wednesday.
But a medical examination later on Wednesday revealed that the 2018 world champion had suffered no injury and was cleared to play.
The Bavarians travel to mercurial Fortuna Duesseldorf, who drew 3-3 in Munich in November thanks to a hat-trick by Dodi Lukebakio.
But the Belgian striker, who has been one of the revelations of the Bundesliga this season with his eight goals and three assists, may not be in the Duesseldorf starting lineup.
""He did not play well in the last two or three matches. He needs to pull himself together,"" said Duesseldorf coach Friedhelm Funkel.
Third-placed RB Leipzig are on 55 points and host European hopefuls VfL Wolfsburg, who are placed sixth with 45.

TAMPA, Fla. — Baylor star Lauren Cox has been taken off the court in a wheelchair with an apparent left knee injury during the third quarter of the NCAA women's national championship game against Notre Dame.
The Lady Bears, seeking their third national title, led 62-50 with 1:22 remaining Sunday night when Cox was injured. The 6-foot-4 forward fell to the floor clutching her left knee under the Notre Dame basket after getting tangled up with teammate Kalani Brown.
Baylor coach Kim Mulkey didn't provide specifics on the injury during an in-game interview but did say ""if Lauren Cox didn't get up, it's very severe.""
Cox was in tears on the court, and her parents were emotional in the stands. Her father buried his head in his hands, and her mother cried.
Mulkey said ""I could cry for her right now, but I have to go work.""
Cox returned to the bench in the fourth quarter on crutches and with a brace on her left knee.

Tony Finau put a lucky 13th ball in his bag for his opening round of one-under-par 71 on Thursday at the Masters.
Along with the four sleeves of three balls that he typically carries, Finau had one with the Augusta National logo signed by his idol, Billy Casper.
Casper, the 1970 Masters champion, became something of a Finau fan years ago, when they met in Utah, their shared home state. He died at 83 three years before Finau, 29, made his Masters debut, managing a tie for 10th last year despite sustaining a
high-ankle sprain while celebrating a hole in one
during the Wednesday par-3 contest.
After watching Finau gamely make his way around Augusta National, a friend, Larry Olsen, gave him the ball signed by Casper.
“After last year’s incident,” Finau said, referring to his injury, “Larry felt Billy would have wanted me to have it.”
For nearly a year, the ball sat on a shelf in Finau’s trophy room in his home near Salt Lake City. He decided to put it in his bag for this event to honor Casper, who loved the Masters, and also as a talisman.
“Maybe Casper the ghost will appear, and we’ll get that green jacket,” Finau, who is ranked 15th in the world, said Thursday with a laugh.
Finau evoked Casper’s memory by scrapping through the first round in what his caddie, Gregory Bodine, described as “a nervy start.”
Finau found fairway bunkers off the tee at Nos. 1 and 2, hit out of the sand on four of the first five holes and somehow made the turn at par. He got up and down for par at the fifth hole from a bunker behind the green and almost chipped in on the par-3 sixth after a bad tee shot.
“I think those were the huge momentum changers throughout the round that you need to post a good number,” said Finau, who offset his bogey at the par-3 fourth with a birdie at the par-5 eighth to make the turn in 36 strokes.
“I was quite pleased, actually, to be teeing off at 10 at even par,” he said. He had birdies on both the par 5s on the back nine and, after bogeying 17th, just missed a birdie at 18 to finish the day five strokes off the lead.
One of Casper’s 11 children is certain that their father would have been impressed by Finau’s round.
“Even though Tony hits the ball a huge distance, what Dad saw and really liked about his play was his course management and his ability to get the ball around the golf course,” Casper’s son Bob, the third oldest of the 11, said in a telephone interview. “Because those where things that Dad prided himself on in his game.”
Finau recalled that Casper had once described his 18-hole playoff victory over Gene Littler at Augusta National as his “proudest moment.” He and Casper met for the first time at a golf event in Utah, where Casper kept a residence in addition to one in his native San Diego.
Finau was 14 and showing great promise in the game, which he
learned to play by swinging at targets on mattresses
hung from the ceiling of his family’s garage in Salt Lake City. Finau’s hardscrabble beginnings and close family ties reminded Casper of himself.
The next time they saw each other, late in Finau’s teenage years, Casper presented him with an autographed copy of his memoir,
“The Big Three and Me.”
The Big Three referred to Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer and Gary Player, who commandeered the headlines and the commercial enterprises while Casper quietly went about winning. He finished with 51 PGA Tour victories and collected at least one title in 16 consecutive seasons, from 1956 to 1971.
“He won more tournaments than the Big Three in the ‘70s and ‘80s,” Finau said. “It’s laughable that people don’t talk about him as one of the greatest of all time.”
“Deep down, I think he believed I could be somebody in the game,” Finau added,” “ and giving me his book and wishing me well was really all I needed as a kid to be inspired.”
After Casper died of a heart attack, Finau attended the funeral. “It meant a lot to our family, and it would have meant a lot to Dad,” Bob Casper said.
Casper’s widow, Shirley, an octogenarian, follows Finau’s progress and occasionally posts messages to his Instagram page.
“She loved that my dad really liked Tony,” Bob Casper said, adding, “I think what my dad saw, and what she now sees, is a heart of a champion; someone who hasn’t necessarily taken the easy road to hone their craft.”
Shirley Casper followed Finau’s round on television and afterward sounded as if she had seen a ghost.
“Tony played the percentage shots just like Billy,” she said through Rich Katz, a family spokesman. “If the pin is on one side and there’s danger there, he’d hit away from that even if he’d two-putt.”
“He’s a very careful, conservative and smart player,” she added. “I look forward to him contending.”

Seth Jones' power-play goal late in the third period capped a thrilling rally as the Columbus Blue Jackets erased a three-goal deficit and stunned the host Tampa Bay Lightning 4-3 on Wednesday in the opening round of the Stanley Cup playoffs.
Jones scored his second career playoff goal with 5:55 to play. He took a slick pass from Artemi Panarin and roofed the power-play goal to complete a spree of four unanswered goals, three of which came in the third period.
Josh Anderson had a goal and an assist, and Nick Foligno and David Savard also tallied for the Blue Jackets, who lost all three regular-season meetings with the Lightning by a combined score of 17-3.
The Lightning, who won the Presidents' Trophy and tied an NHL single-season record with 62 wins, led 3-0 after one period on goals by Alex Killorn, Anthony Cirelli and Yanni Gourde.
Blues 2, Jets 1
Tyler Bozak scored the game winner with overtime looming as St. Louis rode a third-period comeback to a stunning win at Winnipeg in the opener of a first-round Western Conference playoff series.
With his team controlling play for much of the third period, St. Louis' Patrick Maroon created a turnover with his effective forecheck and sent the puck to the slot for Bozak. Bozak snapped a quick shot that found the mark for the game winner with 2:05 remaining in regulation.
The Jets pushed hard for the equalizer, but couldn't solve St. Louis goalie Jordan Binnington, who made 24 saves. With 12.4 seconds remaining, Binnington got across his net in time to deny Mark Scheifele's one-timer. Winnipeg's Patrik Laine opened the scoring in the first period, and St. Louis' David Perron responded early in the third.
Islanders 4, Penguins 3 (OT)
Josh Bailey scored 4:39 into overtime as New York edged Pittsburgh in Game 1 of an Eastern Conference quarterfinal series in Uniondale, N.Y.
Bailey put back the rebound of a shot by Mathew Barzal for the Islanders. Jordan Eberle and Brock Nelson scored in the first period for the Islanders, and Nick Leddy scored in the third. Robin Lehner recorded 41 saves.
Phil Kessel scored in the first period for the Penguins and Evgeni Malkin scored in the second before Justin Schultz forced overtime by scoring with 1:29 remaining in regulation. Matt Murray made 29 saves.
Stars 3, Predators 2
Rookie Miro Heiskanen scored twice, and Mats Zuccarello notched the game-winner midway through the third period as visiting Dallas upset Nashville in the opening clash of their first-round Western Conference playoff series.
Dallas goalie Ben Bishop made 30 saves to hang on for the win over the Central Division champions.
Predators defensemen Roman Josi and P.K. Subban each scored goals, and Pekka Rinne stopped 26 shots.
Sharks 5, Golden Knights 2
Brent Burns, Evander Kane, Tomas Hertl and Marc-Edouard Vlasic each had goal and an assist, and Martin Jones finished with 24 saves to lead host San Jose to the victory over Vegas in Game 1 of a first-round Western Conference playoff series.
Joe Pavelski also scored a goal, and Erik Karlsson added two assists for the Sharks.
Mark Stone scored both goals for Vegas, his first career two-goal playoff game. Max Pacioretty finished with two assists while Marc-Andre Fleury made 28 saves.

The Detroit Pistons wrapped up the NBA's final playoff berth Wednesday night as the regular season concluded.
The reward for the Pistons (41-41)? A first-round Eastern Conference playoff date with the league's best team, the Milwaukee Bucks.
Detroit qualified for the playoffs thanks to a 115-89 road win over the New York Knicks. The Pistons held off a challenge from the Charlotte Hornets, who finished 39-43 after losing 122-114 to the visiting Orlando Magic on Wednesday.
The Magic (42-40) wound up in seventh place in the East, and they will oppose the Toronto Raptors (58-24) in the first round of the playoffs. Orlando has the best current form of any team in the East, winning eight of its last 10 regular-season games.
The other Eastern Conference playoff matchups will see the third-seeded Philadelphia 76ers (51-31) oppose the sixth-seeded Brooklyn Nets (42-40), and the fourth-seeded Boston Celtics (49-33) meet the fifth-seeded Indiana Pacers (48-34).
The two-time defending NBA champion Golden State Warriors (57-25) hold the top seed for the Western Conference playoffs, where their first-round foe will be the eighth-seeded Los Angeles Clippers (47-34).
The other playoff matchups in the West were due to be determined by the results of the Wednesday late games.

The Golden State Warriors are set to begin their quest for a third straight title, and this time it's up to someone else to try to stop them.
With LeBron James gone to the West and this year gone entirely from the postseason, the Eastern Conference headquarters for the NBA Finals won't be in his home for the first time since 2010.
He played for the title for eight straight years, which may have been great for the TV ratings but lately wasn't much good for the competition. The Warriors swept Cleveland last year after winning 4-1 in 2017.
Teams are lining up to seize his old spot atop the East, all capable of providing the intrigue that was absent the last couple years.
There's Milwaukee, with Giannis Antetokounmpo in position to exit June fully atop the NBA with a title and an MVP award.
Or Toronto, humiliated by the Cavaliers in the last two years but armed now with a former NBA Finals MVP in Kawhi Leonard.
It could be Philadelphia, with Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons anchoring perhaps the most talented starting five outside of the Bay Area.
And don't forget Boston, the presumptive East favorite in the preseason that can still live up to expectations.
The best player is gone, but maybe things will be better.
""I think the parity and the competition in the East, and not knowing and everyone having a sincere chance maybe in the East that did not, when not you look between Toronto, Boston, Philadelphia,"" TNT analyst Chris Webber said. ""All of those story lines, new young stars that's coming in.""
The long road to get to the finals begins Saturday with four games, including the top-seeded Warriors against the Los Angeles Clippers in the West. No. 2 Denver faces No. 7 San Antonio in the other West opener, while No. 3 Philadelphia meets No. 6 Brooklyn, and No. 2 Toronto takes on No. 7 Orlando in the East.
On Sunday, the overall No. 1 seed Bucks face No. 8 Detroit, and No. 4 Boston hosts No. 5 Indiana in the East. In the West, No. 3 Portland and No. 6 Oklahoma City meet in a matchup of Northwest Division rivals, and No. 4 Houston and No. 5 Utah square off in the opener of a series between two of the strongest teams in the second half of the season.
It's the start of postseason that looks different far beyond just the absence of James for the first time since 2005.
It includes Denver, in the playoffs for the first time since 2013. Brooklyn is a playoff team for the first time since 2015 and Orlando is back for the first time since 2012.
The Warriors, of course, haven't just been going to the postseason every year, but getting all the way to the finals once they do. They've done that four straight years, winning three of them, and with a strong finish after some occasional lapses surged to the best record in the West.
Still, this playoff path could provide them plenty of obstacles. The Warriors may need to get by scoring champion James Harden and the Rockets, who took them to a seventh game last year in the conference finals, just to get back to that round this time.
""It doesn't matter who you play in the playoffs, you're going to get tested. Everybody's good,"" Golden State coach Steve Kerr said.
Get out of the West, and the Warriors may have to then get on a plane. They had home-court advantage in all four finals against Cleveland, but Milwaukee and Toronto both finished with better records and would host Games 1 and 2 if they win the East.
And there could be the distractions about their future, with Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson able to become free agents this summer.
The Warriors wouldn't be alone when dealing with that. Toronto (Leonard), Philadelphia (Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris) and Boston (Kyrie Irving) all will be trying to win a title with players who could then leave them.
But those are issues for July. First, it's all about just getting to June.
""It's a great feeling,"" Bucks All-Star Khris Middleton said. ""Playoffs don't always come around. I've been a part of that couple years but it's been a great season so far. I know guys been itching to get to this first playoff game.""

MIAMI — Dwyane Wade scored 30 points in the tribute-filled final home game of his career, and the Miami Heat defeated the Philadelphia 76ers 122-99 on Tuesday night.
Bam Adebayo scored 19, Justise Winslow scored 16 and Hassan Whiteside added 15 for the Heat, who were eliminated from playoff contention when Detroit beat Memphis — a result that went final during the third quarter of the Miami-Philly game.
Wade's career will end Wednesday in Brooklyn, when Miami plays its regular-season finale. He checked out for the last time with 1:02 left, embracing teammates and his son Zaire — who was on the Heat bench.
Greg Monroe scored 18 points and Ben Simmons scored 16 for Philadelphia, which entered Tuesday already locked into the No. 3 seed for the Eastern Conference playoffs and rested Joel Embiid and J.J. Redick. Simmons played only 21 minutes, Tobias Harris shot 3 for 16 in 20 minutes and Jimmy Butler scored only four points in 16 minutes.
Butler did get one prize — he was the recipient of Wade's final postgame jersey exchange with an opponent.
Jonathon Simmons scored 14 for the 76ers.
Wade scored the first basket of the game on a dunk, Philadelphia scored the next eight — and it was all Miami the rest of the way. Winslow had three 3-pointers and Wade scored six points in a 22-2 Heat run that put Miami in control early, and the outcome was never in question again.
The final minutes were all Wade. He swished a 3-pointer. He banked in a pair of them. He got slapped on his backside by a fan — in this case, it was permitted, since the fan was his wife Gabrielle Union-Wade. He scored 14 of his points in that final quarter.
It was his night, and only his night.
The game was the sideshow.
The reason every seat was filled was Wade.
There was a pregame ceremony, capping a day of tributes. Former President Barack Obama sent a video that was played during the first quarter. Wade's oldest sons and his nephew appeared in taped messages as well. John Legend and Chrissy Teigen were courtside, as was Heat legend Chris Bosh and his wife Adrienne.
The ovations were constant, as were the ""M-V-P"" chants. And one of the loudest roars came with 11:05 left, when Wade and Udonis Haslem — the only two players to play for all three Heat championship teams, and the longest-tenured Heat players ever — checked in together.
TIP-INS
76ers: This is the first time Philadelphia has posted consecutive seasons of 50 or more wins since 1984-85 and 1985-86. ... Philadelphia missed 17 of its first 18 tries from 3-point range.
Heat: It took Haslem less than a minute to do one of the things he does best — take a charge. ... Wade played in 575 games in a Heat uniform at home. Miami won 401 of them, and he scored 13,323 points in those contests.
McGRUDER DECISION
Miami will not be a tax team this year, saving about a $5 million payment because Rodney McGruder was claimed Tuesday by the Los Angeles Clippers — two days after he was waived by the Heat. If Miami had won at Toronto on Sunday, McGruder would likely still be with the Heat. ""That was one of the tougher franchise moves our organization has had to make,"" said coach Erik Spoelstra, who raves about McGruder.
REST DAY
The 76ers plan to sit Embiid and Redick again Wednesday, and will also give Ben Simmons and Harris the night off. ""Some people like to have a rhythm going into it, some people like to have time off. I don't think you can appoint the perfect formula,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said.

The Minnesota Timberwolves plan to offer interim coach Ryan Saunders a multiyear deal as early as this week, league sources told ESPN.
Saunders, 32, is the youngest head coach in the league. He took over when Tom Thibodeau was fired in early January and he has earned the endorsement of his players, most notably from All-Star center Karl-Anthony Towns.
The Timberwolves are 36-45 entering Wednesday night's season finale at Denver, including a 17-24 mark under Saunders' leadership.
Saunders will reportedly receive a three-year deal with a team option on the final season.
Saunders had been an assistant coach with Minnesota since 2014, after serving as an assistant with the Washington Wizards from 2009-14.
Saunders' father, Flip, was the head coach of the Timberwolves from 1995-2005 and again in 2014-15. Flip Saunders guided the team to eight straight playoff appearances.
ESPN also reported that Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor plans to retain general manager Scott Layden, who has been with the team since 2016.
On Wednesday, the team announced it was starting its search for a president of basketball operations, a position that has been vacant since Thibodeau's dismissal.
""In the absence of Tom, I want to thank all who picked up his responsibilities this past year. This includes Interim Head Coach Ryan Saunders, General Manager Scott Layden and our entire basketball staff for their efforts leading our team through the 2018-19 season,"" Taylor said in a statement. ""They worked through a season with many injuries requiring many challenges in our player lineup. We are incredibly grateful to them for all of their hard work and commitment to the franchise.""

RIO DE JANEIRO — The chances of FIFA increasing the number of teams at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar from 32 to 48 is 50/50, the president of soccer's governing body Gianni Infantino said on Wednesday.
Infantino, who is in Brazil for a meeting of the South American Football Confederation, told delegates he was working to ensure the increase for the Qatar tournament, which would mean a guaranteed two extra places for South American sides.
""We are working to see if we can get 48 teams in the 2022 World Cup because more participation means more development and more passion for everyone,"" he said.
""We’ll see by June whether it is possible or not. (It’s) 50/50. What is 100 percent is that the 2022 World Cup is going to be spectacular and a total success.""
A final decision on the number of teams for the next finals will be taken at the FIFA Congress in Paris on June 5.
FIFA chose to host the 2022 World Cup for 32 teams in Qatar, although Infantino has sounded out neighbors over their willingness to host some matches in an expanded tournament.
FIFA has already agreed to increase the number of teams to 48 for the 2026 tournament being co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico but is keen to expand quicker than planned.

SYDNEY — Israel Folau's use of social media has not only once again put his rugby union career in jeopardy but also given Wallabies coach Michael Cheika another headache as the Rugby World Cup approaches.
Folau, a fundamentalist Christian, posted a meme on Instagram on Wednesday that said gay people and others he perceived to be ""living in sin"" would be condemned to ""hell"" if they failed to ""repent"".
It was denounced as ""unacceptable"" by both Rugby Australia and his state team the New South Wales Waratahs and has been referred him to their integrity unit.
It is the second time in 12 months that Folau has created controversy for Rugby Australia by using social media to express his personal beliefs.
Last April he made similar comments, which caused extreme discomfort at Rugby Australia as they conducted negotiations with him over a new contract while also dealing with key sponsors threatening to withdraw their backing.
Folau, Australia's best known player, escaped sanctions but was reminded by RA chief executive Raelene Castle of his responsibilities on social media and in February signed a contract extension until 2022.
His latest comments, however, have drawn calls for his contract to be torn up five months out from the World Cup.
""Israel Folau has to go, and will go ... Rugby Australia simply has no choice,"" Wallabies lock turned progressive media commentator Peter Fitzsimons wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald.
""They cannot go through one more time the agony of last year when Folau's social media comments trumpeting that gays would go to hell, saw rugby lose sponsors, fans, and support.
""Then it took three weeks for Folau to pull his head in, and it seemed like he got it: that you couldn't be a standard bearer for the inclusive game of rugby and put out bigoted nastiness like that.
""This time, it won't take three weeks. Rugby must surely move quickly, or be made to look ridiculous.""
Any such move, however, would throw Cheika's World Cup plans into disarray with the former rugby league international one of the few world class players available to him.
The 1.94m tall Folau, who also played two seasons of top-level Australia Rules football, is one of the best players in the world under the high ball, a tactic that is likely to be used extensively in Japan.
An elusive and dangerous runner, Folau only last weekend became the highest try-scorer in Super Rugby when he crossed for his 60th try against the Auckland Blues.
After winning just four of 13 tests last season, the Wallabies are already under pressure to at least repeat their exploits from the 2015 World Cup, when Cheika led them to the final against New Zealand.
Despite efforts to develop depth, Cheika also only has one other player truly comfortable at fullback -- Dane Haylett-Petty -- to call on if Folau is fired or he walks away, something he said he was willing to do last year.

Seth Jones' power-play goal late in the third period capped a thrilling rally as the Columbus Blue Jackets erased a three-goal deficit and stunned the host Tampa Bay Lightning 4-3 on Wednesday in the opening round of the Stanley Cup playoffs.
Jones scored his second career playoff goal with 5:55 to play. He took a slick pass from Artemi Panarin and roofed the power-play goal to complete a spree of four unanswered goals, three of which came in the third period.
Josh Anderson had a goal and an assist, and Nick Foligno and David Savard also tallied for the Blue Jackets, who lost all three regular-season meetings with the Lightning by a combined score of 17-3.
The Lightning, who won the Presidents' Trophy and tied an NHL single-season record with 62 wins, led 3-0 after one period on goals by Alex Killorn, Anthony Cirelli and Yanni Gourde.
Blues 2, Jets 1
Tyler Bozak scored the game winner with overtime looming as St. Louis rode a third-period comeback to a stunning win at Winnipeg in the opener of a first-round Western Conference playoff series.
With his team controlling play for much of the third period, St. Louis' Patrick Maroon created a turnover with his effective forecheck and sent the puck to the slot for Bozak. Bozak snapped a quick shot that found the mark for the game winner with 2:05 remaining in regulation.
The Jets pushed hard for the equalizer, but couldn't solve St. Louis goalie Jordan Binnington, who made 24 saves. With 12.4 seconds remaining, Binnington got across his net in time to deny Mark Scheifele's one-timer. Winnipeg's Patrik Laine opened the scoring in the first period, and St. Louis' David Perron responded early in the third.
Islanders 4, Penguins 3 (OT)
Josh Bailey scored 4:39 into overtime as New York edged Pittsburgh in Game 1 of an Eastern Conference quarterfinal series in Uniondale, N.Y.
Bailey put back the rebound of a shot by Mathew Barzal for the Islanders. Jordan Eberle and Brock Nelson scored in the first period for the Islanders, and Nick Leddy scored in the third. Robin Lehner recorded 41 saves.
Phil Kessel scored in the first period for the Penguins and Evgeni Malkin scored in the second before Justin Schultz forced overtime by scoring with 1:29 remaining in regulation. Matt Murray made 29 saves.
Stars 3, Predators 2
Rookie Miro Heiskanen scored twice, and Mats Zuccarello notched the game-winner midway through the third period as visiting Dallas upset Nashville in the opening clash of their first-round Western Conference playoff series.
Dallas goalie Ben Bishop made 30 saves to hang on for the win over the Central Division champions.
Predators defensemen Roman Josi and P.K. Subban each scored goals, and Pekka Rinne stopped 26 shots.
Sharks 5, Golden Knights 2
Brent Burns, Evander Kane, Tomas Hertl and Marc-Edouard Vlasic each had goal and an assist, and Martin Jones finished with 24 saves to lead host San Jose to the victory over Vegas in Game 1 of a first-round Western Conference playoff series.
Joe Pavelski also scored a goal, and Erik Karlsson added two assists for the Sharks.
Mark Stone scored both goals for Vegas, his first career two-goal playoff game. Max Pacioretty finished with two assists while Marc-Andre Fleury made 28 saves.

The Detroit Pistons wrapped up the NBA's final playoff berth Wednesday night as the regular season concluded.
The reward for the Pistons (41-41)? A first-round Eastern Conference playoff date with the league's best team, the Milwaukee Bucks.
Detroit qualified for the playoffs thanks to a 115-89 road win over the New York Knicks. The Pistons held off a challenge from the Charlotte Hornets, who finished 39-43 after losing 122-114 to the visiting Orlando Magic on Wednesday.

The two-time defending NBA champion Golden State Warriors (57-25) hold the top seed for the Western Conference playoffs, where their first-round foe will be the eighth-seeded Los Angeles Clippers (47-34).
The other playoff matchups in the West were due to be determined by the results of the Wednesday late games.

Tony Finau put a lucky 13th ball in his bag for his opening round of one-under-par 71 on Thursday at the Masters.
Along with the four sleeves of three balls that he typically carries, Finau had one with the Augusta National logo signed by his idol, Billy Casper.
Casper, the 1970 Masters champion, became something of a Finau fan years ago, when they met in Utah, their shared home state. He died at 83 three years before Finau, 29, made his Masters debut, managing a tie for 10th last year despite sustaining a
high-ankle sprain while celebrating a hole in one
during the Wednesday par-3 contest.
After watching Finau gamely make his way around Augusta National, a friend, Larry Olsen, gave him the ball signed by Casper.
“After last year’s incident,” Finau said, referring to his injury, “Larry felt Billy would have wanted me to have it.”
For nearly a year, the ball sat on a shelf in Finau’s trophy room in his home near Salt Lake City. He decided to put it in his bag for this event to honor Casper, who loved the Masters, and also as a talisman.
“Maybe Casper the ghost will appear, and we’ll get that green jacket,” Finau, who is ranked 15th in the world, said Thursday with a laugh.
Finau evoked Casper’s memory by scrapping through the first round in what his caddie, Gregory Bodine, described as “a nervy start.”
Finau found fairway bunkers off the tee at Nos. 1 and 2, hit out of the sand on four of the first five holes and somehow made the turn at par. He got up and down for par at the fifth hole from a bunker behind the green and almost chipped in on the par-3 sixth after a bad tee shot.
“I think those were the huge momentum changers throughout the round that you need to post a good number,” said Finau, who offset his bogey at the par-3 fourth with a birdie at the par-5 eighth to make the turn in 36 strokes.
“I was quite pleased, actually, to be teeing off at 10 at even par,” he said. He had birdies on both the par 5s on the back nine and, after bogeying 17th, just missed a birdie at 18 to finish the day five strokes off the lead.
One of Casper’s 11 children is certain that their father would have been impressed by Finau’s round.
“Even though Tony hits the ball a huge distance, what Dad saw and really liked about his play was his course management and his ability to get the ball around the golf course,” Casper’s son Bob, the third oldest of the 11, said in a telephone interview. “Because those where things that Dad prided himself on in his game.”
Finau recalled that Casper had once described his 18-hole playoff victory over Gene Littler at Augusta National as his “proudest moment.” He and Casper met for the first time at a golf event in Utah, where Casper kept a residence in addition to one in his native San Diego.
Finau was 14 and showing great promise in the game, which he
learned to play by swinging at targets on mattresses
hung from the ceiling of his family’s garage in Salt Lake City. Finau’s hardscrabble beginnings and close family ties reminded Casper of himself.
The next time they saw each other, late in Finau’s teenage years, Casper presented him with an autographed copy of his memoir,
“The Big Three and Me.”
The Big Three referred to Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer and Gary Player, who commandeered the headlines and the commercial enterprises while Casper quietly went about winning. He finished with 51 PGA Tour victories and collected at least one title in 16 consecutive seasons, from 1956 to 1971.
“He won more tournaments than the Big Three in the ‘70s and ‘80s,” Finau said. “It’s laughable that people don’t talk about him as one of the greatest of all time.”
“Deep down, I think he believed I could be somebody in the game,” Finau added,” “ and giving me his book and wishing me well was really all I needed as a kid to be inspired.”
After Casper died of a heart attack, Finau attended the funeral. “It meant a lot to our family, and it would have meant a lot to Dad,” Bob Casper said.
Casper’s widow, Shirley, an octogenarian, follows Finau’s progress and occasionally posts messages to his Instagram page.
“She loved that my dad really liked Tony,” Bob Casper said, adding, “I think what my dad saw, and what she now sees, is a heart of a champion; someone who hasn’t necessarily taken the easy road to hone their craft.”
Shirley Casper followed Finau’s round on television and afterward sounded as if she had seen a ghost.
“Tony played the percentage shots just like Billy,” she said through Rich Katz, a family spokesman. “If the pin is on one side and there’s danger there, he’d hit away from that even if he’d two-putt.”
“He’s a very careful, conservative and smart player,” she added. “I look forward to him contending.”

MIAMI — Dwyane Wade scored 30 points in the tribute-filled final home game of his career, and the Miami Heat defeated the Philadelphia 76ers 122-99 on Tuesday night.
Bam Adebayo scored 19, Justise Winslow scored 16 and Hassan Whiteside added 15 for the Heat, who were eliminated from playoff contention when Detroit beat Memphis — a result that went final during the third quarter of the Miami-Philly game.
Wade's career will end Wednesday in Brooklyn, when Miami plays its regular-season finale. He checked out for the last time with 1:02 left, embracing teammates and his son Zaire — who was on the Heat bench.
Greg Monroe scored 18 points and Ben Simmons scored 16 for Philadelphia, which entered Tuesday already locked into the No. 3 seed for the Eastern Conference playoffs and rested Joel Embiid and J.J.

The final minutes were all Wade. He swished a 3-pointer. He banked in a pair of them. He got slapped on his backside by a fan — in this case, it was permitted, since the fan was his wife Gabrielle Union-Wade. He scored 14 of his points in that final quarter.
It was his night, and only his night.

Miami will not be a tax team this year, saving about a $5 million payment because Rodney McGruder was claimed Tuesday by the Los Angeles Clippers — two days after he was waived by the Heat.

The Golden State Warriors are set to begin their quest for a third straight title, and this time it's up to someone else to try to stop them.
With LeBron James gone to the West and this year gone entirely from the postseason, the Eastern Conference headquarters for the NBA Finals won't be in his home for the first time since 2010.
He played for the title for eight straight years, which may have been great for the TV ratings but lately wasn't much good for the competition. The Warriors swept Cleveland last year after winning 4-1 in 2017.
Teams are lining up to seize his old spot atop the East, all capable of providing the intrigue that was absent the last couple years.
There's Milwaukee, with Giannis Antetokounmpo in position to exit June fully atop the NBA with a title and an MVP award.
Or Toronto, humiliated by the Cavaliers in the last two years but armed now with a former NBA Finals MVP in Kawhi Leonard.
It could be Philadelphia, with Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons anchoring perhaps the most talented starting five outside of the Bay Area.
And don't forget Boston, the presumptive East favorite in the preseason that can still live up to expectations.
The best player is gone, but maybe things will be better.
""I think the parity and the competition in the East, and not knowing and everyone having a sincere chance maybe in the East that did not, when not you look between Toronto, Boston, Philadelphia,"" TNT analyst Chris Webber said. ""All of those story lines, new young stars that's coming in.""
The long road to get to the finals begins Saturday with four games, including the top-seeded Warriors against the Los Angeles Clippers in the West. No. 2 Denver faces No. 7 San Antonio in the other West opener, while No. 3 Philadelphia meets No. 6 Brooklyn, and No. 2 Toronto takes on No. 7 Orlando in the East.
On Sunday, the overall No. 1 seed Bucks face No. 8 Detroit, and No. 4 Boston hosts No. 5 Indiana in the East. In the West, No. 3 Portland and No. 6 Oklahoma City meet in a matchup of Northwest Division rivals, and No. 4 Houston and No. 5 Utah square off in the opener of a series between two of the strongest teams in the second half of the season.
It's the start of postseason that looks different far beyond just the absence of James for the first time since 2005.
It includes Denver, in the playoffs for the first time since 2013. Brooklyn is a playoff team for the first time since 2015 and Orlando is back for the first time since 2012.
The Warriors, of course, haven't just been going to the postseason every year, but getting all the way to the finals once they do. They've done that four straight years, winning three of them, and with a strong finish after some occasional lapses surged to the best record in the West.
Still, this playoff path could provide them plenty of obstacles. The Warriors may need to get by scoring champion James Harden and the Rockets, who took them to a seventh game last year in the conference finals, just to get back to that round this time.
""It doesn't matter who you play in the playoffs, you're going to get tested. Everybody's good,"" Golden State coach Steve Kerr said.
Get out of the West, and the Warriors may have to then get on a plane. They had home-court advantage in all four finals against Cleveland, but Milwaukee and Toronto both finished with better records and would host Games 1 and 2 if they win the East.
And there could be the distractions about their future, with Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson able to become free agents this summer.
The Warriors wouldn't be alone when dealing with that. Toronto (Leonard), Philadelphia (Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris) and Boston (Kyrie Irving) all will be trying to win a title with players who could then leave them.
But those are issues for July. First, it's all about just getting to June.
""It's a great feeling,"" Bucks All-Star Khris Middleton said. ""Playoffs don't always come around. I've been a part of that couple years but it's been a great season so far. I know guys been itching to get to this first playoff game.""

LONDON — Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino fears the ""spirit of football"" is being changed by Video Assistant Referee (VAR) after his side fell victim to technology on Tuesday.
As it turned out the penalty awarded by VAR against Danny Rose for handball was missed by Sergio Aguero and Tottenham went on to earn a crucial 1-0 win in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final at their new ground.
But that could not hide Pochettino's unease at a system that will be rolled out in the Premier League next season.
While a sliding Rose's arm did make contact with the ball as he attempted to block Raheem Sterling's shot, no City player appealed for a penalty - evidence in itself that the decision was the kind of marginal one that could be debated all night.
Pochettino himself said in the letter of the law it could possibly have been a penalty, but rules on what constitutes handball appear open to interpretation.
As it stands in the International Football Association Board (IFAB) rulebook, a player can be penalised for handball if their arms extend 'beyond a natural silhouette' - even if accidental.
Manchester United beat Paris St Germain thanks to a late VAR penalty this season after Diogo Dalot's shot struck Presnel Kimpembe on the arm and went over the crossbar - a decision Neymar branded a 'disgrace'.
Pochettino was more measured, perhaps as the penalty was saved by Hugo Lloris, but still raised concerns that there are too many grey areas in deciding on handball.
""There's a lot of work to do with VAR,"" he told reporters. ""We know there are many decisions that no one knows if VAR is going to be used or not, to check or not.
""Maybe technically it was a penalty because it was handball, but we do not know the protocol. There are a lot of question marks and a lot of work to do.
""I think it's going to change the spirit of the game and I'm very worried about how it's going to work next season.""
Tottenham fans chanted ""VAR VAR"" shortly after Aguero's penalty miss, when Harry Kane was challenged in the penalty area - a chant that might become a regular refrain at Premier League grounds next season.
Even when they celebrated Son Heung-min's 78th-minute winner there was an anxious moment when the validity of the goal was checked by VAR - briefly ruining the spontaneity of the moment, which is an integral part of football.
""It's going to be a tough summer to try to find the best way to work. Is it going to check everything?"" Pochettino said.
""I don't know because today there were a lot of actions you could check. Next season, how is it going to work? Many things we need to try to make clear.
""The spirit and the direction of football is going to change. We are going to see a different sport, not the football we grew up watching, that's for sure.""

The Phoenix Suns officially named James Jones as general manager Thursday, giving him control over all basketball operations for the team.
The Suns also added Jeff Bower as senior vice president of basketball operations and retained Trevor Bukstein as assistant general manager. Both will report to Jones, the team said in a statement.
Jones, 38, who played 14 seasons in the league and won three NBA championships, had served as Phoenix's VP of basketball operations the last two seasons. He shared GM duties this past season with Bukstein.
""James has demonstrated a remarkable ability to manage the day-to-day efforts of our front office while developing strong relationships with our players, coaches and those across our organization and league,"" said Suns managing partner Robert Sarver in a statement.
""Furthermore, he is instilling the same championship culture and standard that he experienced on multiple occasions as a player. I have the utmost confidence in James as the leader of our basketball operations moving forward, and we are aligned in the ultimate goal of one day bringing an NBA championship to Phoenix.""
The Suns had been without a full-time general manager since Ryan McDonough was fired a week before the start of the 2018-19 season.
Phoenix finished the season with a 19-63 record.
Bower, 57, was general manager of the Detroit Pistons from 2014-18. He previously served two terms as GM of the Charlotte/New Orleans Hornets from 2001-03 and 2005-10.
""I'm thrilled to add an individual with Jeff's experience and basketball acumen to our front office,"" Jones said. ""Jeff brings a wealth of knowledge in every facet of basketball operations, is of high character and well respected in league circles, and has a proven track record of influencing organizational success. His expertise in creating and executing a plan will be invaluable as we build our team moving forward.""
Bukstein has been an assistant GM with the Suns since 2013.

AUGUSTA, Ga. — Joe Montana or Tom Brady, Serena Williams or Steffi Graf -- there is no shortage of debate in sport over who is the greatest of all time, but do not even try separating golfing icons Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus, according to Gary Player.
Woods (14) and Nicklaus (18) have won 32 majors between them, dominating their respective eras, but that does not mean there is any basis for comparison, Player said on Thursday.
After kicking off the Masters in a ceremonial first tee shot with fellow golf great Nicklaus, nine-times major winner Player reflected on how the game has changed -- and why that makes it impossible to pitch his old sparring partner against Woods.
""How can you compare Tiger Woods to Jack Nicklaus? It's not fair. Let him (Nicklaus) play today with these greens and raked bunkers or bunkers all the same width, and with a driver and a ball that goes 50 yards further,"" Player told reporters.
Sam Snead was the most athletic, Ben Hogan the greatest golfer ""tee-to-green"" and Woods is perhaps the most talented, Player said.
But Nicklaus? ""He had the overall game,"" the three-times Masters champion added.
That is not to say the South African was not giving the most recognizable player in modern golf his due.
""If Tiger never had the problems he had, which were numerous, he would have won at least 20, 21 majors,"" said Player, referring to Woods' physical ailments. ""I don't think there is a debate about that.""
On Thursday, Woods begins his bid for a 15th major win and fifth Masters title.
""Everybody wants to see Tiger Woods win more majors because he moves the needle like nobody playing golf today,"" Player said.
""What you saw when he won that (Tour) Championship the other day, I don't think I ever saw excitement like that, even when Arnold (Palmer) was at his best.""

CLEVELAND — The Cavaliers' next coach will inherit a better situation than the one Larry Drew got handed.
Drew and the Cavs parted ways Thursday after a challenging, 19-win season that followed LeBron James leaving for Los Angeles and included a rash of injuries to a young roster.
Although expected, Drew's departure creates more work for a franchise that will sit out the NBA playoffs this season following a four-year run in the Finals with James.
The 61-year-old Drew met with general manager Koby Altman, and the two decided it was best if they went in separate directions. Altman said in a release that Drew ""respectfully declined to participate in the search process and will not be returning to coach the Cavaliers.""
The Cavs tied for the league's second-worst record with Phoenix, but Drew kept his team playing hard until the end. He received praise from many of his players, including All-Star forward Kevin Love, who was limited to just 22 games following toe surgery.
""We have great respect and appreciation for Larry and the job that he did as the head coach of the Cavaliers for nearly the entire 2018-19 campaign. He brought professionalism, class and steady leadership both this past season and prior four years,"" Altman said in a release. ""All of us in Cleveland wish Larry nothing but the best going forward.""
Altman will embark on a search for Cleveland's fifth coach since 2013. The Cavs will consider college coaches, NBA assistants and former head coaches to continue the rebuild Drew started.
Altman is scheduled to outline some of his plans during a news conference Friday at the team's facility in Independence.
The Cavs' job is enticing on several fronts. Owner Dan Gilbert has displayed a willingness to spend and Cleveland could land one of the top college prospects depending on how things go in next month's draft lottery.
Drew took over when Tyronn Lue, who led the Cavs to a title in 2016, was fired Oct. 28 following a 0-6 start. The 61-year-old Drew spent three seasons with the Cavs, joining Lue's staff for the championship season.
When he replaced Lue, Drew, who previously coached in Atlanta and Milwaukee, knew the Cavs might go in another direction at some point and asked the team to restructure his contract.
Drew's steadying influence helped the Cavs endure injuries which led to him use a league-high 32 different lineups. He also helped in the development of rookie point guard Collin Sexton, who finished strong after a slow start and appears to be a building block for the future.
""I want to thank Dan Gilbert, Koby Altman, the entire organization, and especially our fans, for what has been a very special and rewarding time here in Cleveland,"" Drew said. ""Koby and I had a good discussion following the season and have both decided that the best decision for each of us was that I would not return to coach the team. I am very proud of what we accomplished over the last several years together and will always cherish our championship.
""I also want to commend our players this season for the bond that they established, the way they approached their jobs and the hard work and growth they had every day. I am very proud of them and wish them the best as they continue to develop for the future.""

PARIS — Paris St Germain's experienced Brazil international defender Dani Alves said on Thursday that the club should follow his recommendations to improve in the Champions League.
With three Champions League crowns, three Club World Cup titles and two UEFA Cup triumphs among his trophy haul the full back is the world's most decorated active player, but he feels his voice is not being heard at runaway Ligue 1 leaders PSG.
PSG have been knocked out of the Champions League in the last 16 for three years in a row, going out on away goals against Manchester United this season after winning the first leg 2-0 at Old Trafford.
""I know how to win,"" the 35-year-old, who joined PSG in 2017 from Juventus and has been negotiating a contract extension for next season, told RMC Sport.
""When I want to say something I would like to be followed. Not because I'm better than any other but because I've been there.
""When someone has been there maybe it's good to listen to them, to rely on their experience. Maybe it will work, maybe it won't. I would like that when I say something, one would listen more.""
Alves, who spent six years at Sevilla and eight at Barcelona before moving to Italy in 2016, felt PSG should have been less complacent and more aware that history was against them.
""When you are up against a historical opponent in football, boxing, tennis, history will always be against you,"" he said.
PSG are on the brink of an eighth Ligue 1 title, which they can clinch on Sunday by avoiding defeat at second-placed Lille.

MINNEAPOLIS — The Minnesota Twins have postponed their series opener against the Detroit Tigers because of wintry weather, opting for a doubleheader in May.
The Twins announced Thursday afternoon they were calling off Friday night's game, a decision made about 28 hours before the scheduled first pitch. The region was blanketed by wet snow, heavy winds and icy roads. The storm was forecast to move out before Friday night, but the temperature was predicted to be in the mid-30s.
With dry but chilly afternoons on tap for Saturday and Sunday, when the two teams are also set to play, the Twins rescheduled the Friday game for May 11 in the form of a split day-night doubleheader. The Tigers were already scheduled for a three-game visit to Target Field that weekend.
The Twins (6-4) were off Thursday, and the weather handed them a sixth day off over the first 16 days of the season, the most in the major leagues. Michael Pineda was scheduled to start Friday, opposite Daniel Norris of the Tigers (8-5). The Twins bumped Pineda, off to a strong start following a 1½-year layoff from major league action due to Tommy John elbow surgery, to Saturday, when Tyson Ross will pitch for the Tigers. The matchup Sunday is Jose Berrios for the Twins opposite Jordan Zimmerman for the Tigers.
Last season, a mid-April snowstorm dumped 15 inches of snow in the Twin Cities and wiped out three straight games for the Twins against the Chicago White Sox. The Twins had four postponements over their initial 10-game homestand. After playing inside at the Metrodome from 1982-2009, the Twins have had 24 games postponed at Target Field, where they're starting their 10th season.

LONDON — Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino fears the ""spirit of football"" is being changed by Video Assistant Referee (VAR) after his side fell victim to technology on Tuesday.
As it turned out the penalty awarded by VAR against Danny Rose for handball was missed by Sergio Aguero and Tottenham went on to earn a crucial 1-0 win in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final at their new ground.
But that could not hide Pochettino's unease at a system that will be rolled out in the Premier League next season.
While a sliding Rose's arm did make contact with the ball as he attempted to block Raheem Sterling's shot, no City player appealed for a penalty - evidence in itself that the decision was the kind of marginal one that could be debated all night.
Pochettino himself said in the letter of the law it could possibly have been a penalty, but rules on what constitutes handball appear open to interpretation.
As it stands in the International Football Association Board (IFAB) rulebook, a player can be penalised for handball if their arms extend 'beyond a natural silhouette' - even if accidental.
Manchester United beat Paris St Germain thanks to a late VAR penalty this season after Diogo Dalot's shot struck Presnel Kimpembe on the arm and went over the crossbar - a decision Neymar branded a 'disgrace'.
Pochettino was more measured, perhaps as the penalty was saved by Hugo Lloris, but still raised concerns that there are too many grey areas in deciding on handball.
""There's a lot of work to do with VAR,"" he told reporters. ""We know there are many decisions that no one knows if VAR is going to be used or not, to check or not.
""Maybe technically it was a penalty because it was handball, but we do not know the protocol. There are a lot of question marks and a lot of work to do.
""I think it's going to change the spirit of the game and I'm very worried about how it's going to work next season.""
Tottenham fans chanted ""VAR VAR"" shortly after Aguero's penalty miss, when Harry Kane was challenged in the penalty area - a chant that might become a regular refrain at Premier League grounds next season.
Even when they celebrated Son Heung-min's 78th-minute winner there was an anxious moment when the validity of the goal was checked by VAR - briefly ruining the spontaneity of the moment, which is an integral part of football.
""It's going to be a tough summer to try to find the best way to work. Is it going to check everything?"" Pochettino said.
""I don't know because today there were a lot of actions you could check. Next season, how is it going to work? Many things we need to try to make clear.
""The spirit and the direction of football is going to change. We are going to see a different sport, not the football we grew up watching, that's for sure.""

WELLINGTON — Former All Blacks flyhalf Dan Carter has undergone neck surgery to fix a problem that showed up during a medical examination that cost him a lucrative short-term contract with French club Racing 92.
Carter, a three-times world player of the year and two-time World Cup winner, had agreed a short-term contract with his former club in the French capital but it was cancelled when he failed the medical in early March.
The 37-year-old confirmed at the time he would need to have surgery.
""Another challenge to conquer!,"" Carter said on Thursday on his Twitter account, which included a photograph of him lying in a hospital bed and wearing a neck brace. ""Happy my neck surgery went well and now the long road to recovery starts.""
Carter, who retired from test rugby after the 2015 World Cup final, left Racing in May 2018 at the end of a three-year contract and joined Kobelco Steelers in Japan's Top League.
He led the Steelers to their first title since 2004 last year and had been granted dispensation by the Japanese club to play for Racing as a replacement for Springboks utility back Patrick Lambie, who had to retire in February due to concussion.
French media reports had said Carter had been expected to be paid between 25,000-35,000 euros ($28,187.50-$39,462.50) a month for the contract.
The Top League, normally played from August to January has been postponed this year until next January due to the Rugby World Cup, which is being held in Japan from Sept. 20-Nov. 2.

LOS ANGELES — Kentavious Caldwell-Pope scored 32 points and the short-handed Los Angeles Lakers snapped Utah's seven-game winning streak with a 113-109 victory Sunday night over the playoff-bound Jazz.

UNIONDALE, N.Y. — Josh Bailey didn't have much time to think when he saw the puck on the side of the crease after Mathew Barzal's try hit the left goalpost in overtime. Bailey just swooped in and knocked it into the net to send the New York Islanders home with a win.
Bailey scored at 4:39 of the extra period and the Islanders beat the Pittsburgh Penguins 4-3 on Wednesday night in the opener of their Eastern Conference first-round playoff series.
""It just happened so quick,"" Bailey said. ""I wasn't sure. It didn't lay very flat for me. I was just trying to whack it and hope it went in. ... A crucial game. There's still a long way to go, but a good win for us.""
Barzal had brought the puck into the offensive zone on a 2-on-1 break, faked in front to draw Matt Murray out and sent the backhand shot that bounced off the left post. He was initially upset with himself at missing the opportunity before he saw Bailey come up and put it in.
""I see the puck laying there and I was just obviously (angry), I thought the chance had ended,"" Barzal said. ""And I see Bails come in and swoop in and bury it. I was obviously super happy to see that. Awesome for him. First game and that's nice for the confidence.""
Jordan Eberle had a goal and an assist, and Brock Nelson and Nick Leddy also scored for New York, which was opening a postseason series at home for the first time in 31 years. Robin Lehner stopped 41 shots.
Game 2 is Friday night back at the Nassau Coliseum.
Phil Kessel and Evgeni Malkin each had a goal and an assist, and Justin Schultz also scored for the Penguins. Murray finished with 29 saves.
""It was a hard-fought game,"" Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan said. ""It wasn't perfect out there by any stretch, but I thought we played hard.""
Tom Kuhnhackl, who had a goal in the opening minute of the game waved off for offside, nearly won it for the Islanders 1:12 into the extra period as he crashed into Murray and the puck crossed the goal line — but not before the net came loose. The no-goal was confirmed after a review.
The Islanders led three times in regulation with the Penguins managing to tie it each time.
""We just stayed to it,"" Islanders coach Barry Trotz said. ""I liked our composure on the bench. There were a lot of twists and turns to that game. ... (We) didn't flinch at all.""
Leddy gave the Islanders a 3-2 lead with 7:25 left in the third as he sent a long shot from left point at the blue line that knuckled past Murray.
With Murray pulled for an extra skater, Schultz fired a one-timer from the left circle inside the left post with 1:29 left.
Bailey had a chance at the winner for the Islanders in the closing seconds, but his shot hit the right post. He was glad it didn't end up being a costly miss.
""I was afraid I was going to have to see that in my nightmares for a while,"" Bailey said. ""Yeah, a little bit of redemption. Just happy to get the win.""
Malkin tied it 2-2 on a power play with 6:19 left in the middle period as his shot from the inside edge of the right circle deflected off Islander defenseman Adam Pelech's stick and up past Lehner.
The raucous crowd that was chanting ""Let's Go Islanders!"" from before the teams came out for pregame warmups, roared when the Islanders stepped on the ice and booed loudly when the Penguins followed. They got loud again in the minutes before the teams emerged from their dressing rooms for the start of the game.
Pittsburgh outshot New York 17-12 in the first period, but the Islanders led 2-1 after 20 minutes.
Just more than a minute after Kuhnhackl's opening-minute goal was overturned, Eberle did give the Islanders the lead as he stopped a deflection of Pelech's shot, turned and beat Murray through the five-hole from the right side for his first career postseason goal at 1:40.
The Penguins tied it when Dominik Simon brought the puck down the middle and dropped a pass back to Kessel, who put it past Lehner off the post and in at 5:42.
Nelson put the Islanders back in front on the power play as he got a pass in front from Eberle and put it past Murray with 4:14 left in the opening period.
NOTES: Malkin, Sidney Crosby and Kris Letang are the only Penguins players remaining from the 2013 playoff series against the Islanders. New York has five players left — Nelson, Josh Bailey, Casey Cizikas, Thomas Hickey and Matt Martin. ... Kessel also scored in each of the last three games during the regular season. ... Malkin's goal was his 63rd in the playoffs, breaking a tie with Bobby Hull for sole possession of 26th place on the NHL's career list.

Game 2 is Friday night before the series shifts to Pittsburgh for Games 3 and 4.

WINNIPEG, Manitoba — Pat Maroon set up the winning goal for the St. Louis Blues, and his thoughts immediately turned to his late grandfather.
Tyler Bozak scored with 2:05 left in the third period off Maroon's assist to give the Blues a 2-1 victory over the Winnipeg Jets on Wednesday night in Game 1 of their Western Conference opening-round playoff series.
""He was watching above,"" Maroon said of his grandfather, who died Tuesday at 95 years old. ""So, obviously, that was for him.""
Maroon sent a backhand pass from behind the net out to Bozak in the slot, and Bozak's quick shot went by Winnipeg's Connor Hellebuyck for the go-ahead goal.
""It's been emotional, tough days for me,"" said Maroon, who posted a tribute to his grandfather on Twitter. ""But being with the guys and having them by my side has been really good.""
David Perron also scored for St. Louis early in the third, and Jordan Binnington made 24 saves.
""I had a lot of chances tonight, so I knew the puck was kind of following me around a bit,"" Bozak said. ""It's always fun when that happens, so after the few I missed it was definitely nice to get one in there.""
Patrik Laine scored late in the first period and Hellebuyck stopped 24 shots for the Jets, who host Game 2 on Friday.
""Real tight, and that's what we expect,"" Jets captain Blake Wheeler said of the game. ""We expect it's going to go seven, and seven real close games. It didn't go our way tonight.""
The goalies played a big role in keeping the game tight, even though Binnington took an early tumble to the ice.
Winnipeg's Mark Scheifele was sent to the penalty box 34 seconds into the first period for interference. As he was skating to the back of the St. Louis net, he banged into Binnington, who was behind the net and returning to his crease. Blues forward Brayden Schenn shoved Scheifele hard in retaliation, but only drew boos from fans and not a penalty.
""It's playoff hockey,"" Binnington said. ""I can take a hit.""
Laine sent a blast from the high slot past Binnington at 13:38. The Finnish forward only had one goal in his last 19 games of the regular season.
""We've had a couple of those where they score the winning goal in the last two minutes,"" Laine said. ""So it's always tough, but that's how it goes sometimes. We still had two minutes to tie the game, but couldn't do it. We've got to focus on the next game.""
St. Louis outshot the Jets 8-7 in the opening frame, with Laine having two shots.
On the eve of the series, Laine said his confidence wasn't high and he planned to shoot every puck he could at Binnington to try to make the rookie nervous. The 20-year-old also said the Jets ""have better players in this locker room than they have"" and when they're on their game ""we're just a better team.""
Jets defenseman Dustin Byfuglien helped divert a St. Louis goal early in the second period. Vladimir Tarasenko fired a shot at Hellebuyck and the puck trickled out from under him toward the goal line, but Byfuglien swooped in and slapped it out of the crease.
Winnipeg's penalty kill worked twice more in the second period. Binnington then came up big on a backhand breakaway shot by Par Lindholm and a quick shot from Andrew Copp.
The Jets got their first power play of the game with 3:09 left in the middle frame. Byfuglien had his team's two shots with the man advantage — one was stopped and the other hit the post.
Laine rang a shot off the post just over one minute into the third, followed by Perron's point shot through traffic that went by Hellebuyck to tie it up at 4:05. The Winnipeg netminder blocked a Bozak shot late in the period and then couldn't stop the winner.
Hellebuyck was pulled right away for the extra attacker, but Binnington slid across his crease to make an impressive pad save on Scheifele's one-timer with under 12.4 seconds left.
""The mindset was just compete to the end and give the team a chance to win,"" Binnington said. ""That buzzer couldn't have come sooner.""
NOTES: Winnipeg (47-30-5) and St. Louis (45-28-9) tied for second in the Central Division with 99 points. The Jets earned home-ice advantage with three more combined regulation/overtime victories than the Blues. ... Last season, the Jets soared into the playoffs on a 9-1 run and made it to the Western Conference final, losing to Vegas in five games. The Blues missed the playoffs.

BLACKSBURG, Va. — Mike Young looked around Virginia Tech's Cassell Coliseum and said he's ""so thrilled to be home.""
""My love for ball originated in this building many years ago,"" Young said Monday at a news conference introducing him as Virginia Tech's new basketball coach. Rattling off a list of former players he watched growing up, and pointing toward an NIT banner hanging from the rafters, he added: ""I remember it like it was yesterday.""
The news conference came five days after Buzz Williams resigned to take the men's basketball job at Texas A&M. Young, who grew up just 15 miles from Blacksburg in Radford, Virginia, said the Virginia Tech job is the realization of a dream that was decades in the making for him, since he attended Hokies games with his father as a kid.
""So help me goodness, I have felt this building shake on a number of occasions,"" Young said.
Young, 55, accepted the job over the weekend, ending a 30-year stay at Wofford, the last 17 as head coach. He guided the Terriers to a 299-244 record and five NCAA Tournament appearances. This season the Terriers went 30-5 , climbed to No. 19 in the Top 25 and beat Seton Hall 84-68 in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. They lost in the next round to Kentucky.
Young received a five-year contract that totals $11.5 million in salary, starting at $2 million per year for the first two seasons and then gradually increasing. Bonuses in the deal include a $250,000 payout for winning the Atlantic Coast Conference regular season title.
He inherits a Virginia Tech program that has been to a school-record three consecutive NCAA Tournaments and that advanced to the Sweet 16 before losing 75-73 to overall No. 1 seed Duke. The Hokies won a program record 26 games, but will lose most of their nucleus.
Three seniors — Justin Robinson, Ahmed Hill and Ty Outlaw — completed their eligibility and sophomore Nickeil Alexander-Walker announced on Sunday that he is forgoing his last two seasons of eligibility to make himself available for the NBA draft.
And there could be additional losses.
Kerry Blackshear Jr., who was second on the team with a 14.9 scoring average and led with 7.5 rebounds per game, has graduated but has an additional year of eligibility. Prized freshman Landers Nolley II did not play this season, failing to get NCAA clearance.
Player movement has become a constant, Young said.
""You understand it. You accept it for what it is. You don't like it, but you've got to pick up and do the best you can with what you have,"" Young said of the growing trend of players transferring. ""The guys that are here . I know those guys enjoyed Virginia Tech.""
Young met briefly with the players for the first time just before the new conference and said he was ""impressed with their eye contact and body language."" He added that he is eager to get the formalities over with ""and get out on the court with them.""
Athletic director Whit Babcock said he had no ""short list"" for possible replacements when he learned Williams was being courted by the Aggies in his native Texas. He described the coaching search as wide-ranging and involving discussions with a great number of people in the industry.
But, he added, ""we only sat in front of one guy, and that was coach Young.""

SAN JOSE, Calif. — Joe Pavelski took a puck off his chin to score the opening goal and the San Jose Sharks raced past the Vegas Golden Knights with a 5-2 victory Wednesday night in Game 1 of their first-round series.
Brent Burns, Marc-Edouard Vlasic and Evander Kane added goals in a wild second period that featured heavy hitting, a parade to the penalty box and the high intensity expected in a series between two franchises that have become fierce rivals in just two seasons.
Tomas Hertl added an empty-net goal and Martin Jones made 24 saves to get San Jose started off right in this series heading into Game 2 on Friday night.
Mark Stone scored both goals for the Golden Knights, who struggled to generate much offense at all against a Sharks team that has appeared to shake off a late-season slide in time for the postseason. Marc-Andre Fleury made 28 saves.
The captain set the tone for the Sharks with his goal in the first period and then his presence on the ice in the second despite playing hurt thanks to taking a puck to his face.
With the Sharks on the power play, Pavelski went to the front of the net, where he is usually so adept at tipping pucks with his stick for goals. Burns' point shot came in high and hit him in the chin instead before bouncing into the net.
Pavelski was unable even to celebrate, heading straight to the dressing room for treatment while the crowd roared at the series-opening goal. There was concern in the arena when Pavelski didn't come out to start the second but he re-emerged early in the period with a bloody mouth and a full shield to protect his injured face.
Things then got wild early in the period following a series of penalties. After coincidental minors to San Jose's Brenden Dillon and Jonathan Marchessault left the teams playing four on four, the Sharks went on a power play when Deryk Engelland was called for a trip.
That was quickly negated when Pavelski was called for tripping, creating the rare 3-on-3 in the playoffs. The Sharks capitalized when Erik Karlsson fed Burns, who beat Fleury from the top of the circle with a wrister to make it 2-0.
Then with the teams back at 4-on-4 less than a minute later, Joe Thornton set up Vlasic in the slot for the goal that made it 3-0.
The Golden Knights got on the board seconds after Pavelski's penalty ended when Stone got inside of Burns at the side of the net to knock in a loose puck.
But the Sharks regained the three-goal lead with 17.1 seconds remaining in the period when Kane deftly deflected a perfect pass from Karlsson at the point past Fleury.
Stone scored late in the third on a power play to make it 4-2. But Jones stopped Reilly Smith on a breakaway with less than three minutes left and Hertl sealed it with his empty-netter.
The Sharks went into the series looking to avoid the slow starts that have plagued them against Vegas the past two seasons. The Golden Knights had scored in the first five minutes in eight of 14 meetings, including all four this season.
But San Jose didn't even allow a shot on goal in the first five minutes, spending most of the time in Vegas' zone. The Sharks then got on the board late in the period in painful fashion with Pavelski's goal after fourth-liner Micheal Haley drew a penalty on Pierre-Edouard Bellemare for the game's first power play.
NOTES: Karlsson had two assists in his second game back after missing 17 games with a groin injury. ... Fleury has allowed at least four goals in all three games since missing nearly three weeks with a lower-body injury.

CHICAGO — Blake Snell struck out 11 over six innings in another strong outing, and the Tampa Bay Rays beat the Chicago White Sox 5-1 on Monday.
The Rays improved to 8-3 and kept pace with their best start since 2010.
Snell (2-1) gave up one run and six hits and did not walk a batter in winning his second straight start. Since a season-opening loss to Houston, the reigning AL Cy Young Award winner has held Colorado and Chicago to one run and one walk while striking out 24 over 13 innings.
Avisail Garcia had two hits, including an RBI single in the second that made it 4-0. He also struck out three times against his former team.
Tommy Pham scored two runs and extended his club-record on-base streak to 43 games.
Willy Adames had three hits and two runs, and Guillermo Heredia and Austin Meadows drew bases-loaded walks. Hunter Wood, recalled from Triple-A Durham, threw three scoreless for his first big league save.
Chicago's Carlos Rodon (1-2) gave up four runs and eight hits in 4 2/3 innings. The left-hander walked five and threw a wild pitch to go with nine strikeouts.
Jose Rondon homered against Snell. Carson Fulmer worked three solid innings in relief after being recalled from Triple-A Charlotte, but the White Sox fell to 3-6.
Rodon threw 65 pitches in the first two innings and walked four as Tampa Bay grabbed a 4-0 lead.
Heredia drew a bases-loaded walk and Ji-Man Choi added a sacrifice fly in the first. Brandon Lowe ended that rally by striking out with the bases loaded when he tried to check his swing on a low 3-2 pitch that looked like ball four.
The Rays scored two more in the second on an RBI bunt single by Daniel Robertson and base hit to center by Avisail Garcia.
Rondon hit a solo homer in the fifth. The White Sox had two runners on in the sixth after Leury Garcia doubled and Tim Anderson singled off the pitcher's glove. But Snell struck out the next three batters.

SAN JOSE, Calif. — Joe Pavelski took a puck off his chin to score the opening goal and the San Jose Sharks raced past the Vegas Golden Knights with a 5-2 victory Wednesday night in Game 1 of their first-round series.
Brent Burns, Marc-Edouard Vlasic and Evander Kane added goals in a wild second period that featured heavy hitting, a parade to the penalty box and the high intensity expected in a series between two franchises that have become fierce rivals in just two seasons.
Tomas Hertl added an empty-net goal and Martin Jones made 24 saves to get San Jose started off right in this series heading into Game 2 on Friday night.
Mark Stone scored both goals for the Golden Knights, who struggled to generate much offense at all against a Sharks team that has appeared to shake off a late-season slide in time for the postseason. Marc-Andre Fleury made 28 saves.
The captain set the tone for the Sharks with his goal in the first period and then his presence on the ice in the second despite playing hurt thanks to taking a puck to his face.
With the Sharks on the power play, Pavelski went to the front of the net, where he is usually so adept at tipping pucks with his stick for goals. Burns' point shot came in high and hit him in the chin instead before bouncing into the net.
Pavelski was unable even to celebrate, heading straight to the dressing room for treatment while the crowd roared at the series-opening goal. There was concern in the arena when Pavelski didn't come out to start the second but he re-emerged early in the period with a bloody mouth and a full shield to protect his injured face.
Things then got wild early in the period following a series of penalties. After coincidental minors to San Jose's Brenden Dillon and Jonathan Marchessault left the teams playing four on four, the Sharks went on a power play when Deryk Engelland was called for a trip.
That was quickly negated when Pavelski was called for tripping, creating the rare 3-on-3 in the playoffs. The Sharks capitalized when Erik Karlsson fed Burns, who beat Fleury from the top of the circle with a wrister to make it 2-0.
Then with the teams back at 4-on-4 less than a minute later, Joe Thornton set up Vlasic in the slot for the goal that made it 3-0.
The Golden Knights got on the board seconds after Pavelski's penalty ended when Stone got inside of Burns at the side of the net to knock in a loose puck.
But the Sharks regained the three-goal lead with 17.1 seconds remaining in the period when Kane deftly deflected a perfect pass from Karlsson at the point past Fleury.
Stone scored late in the third on a power play to make it 4-2. But Jones stopped Reilly Smith on a breakaway with less than three minutes left and Hertl sealed it with his empty-netter.
The Sharks went into the series looking to avoid the slow starts that have plagued them against Vegas the past two seasons. The Golden Knights had scored in the first five minutes in eight of 14 meetings, including all four this season.
But San Jose didn't even allow a shot on goal in the first five minutes, spending most of the time in Vegas' zone. The Sharks then got on the board late in the period in painful fashion with Pavelski's goal after fourth-liner Micheal Haley drew a penalty on Pierre-Edouard Bellemare for the game's first power play.
NOTES: Karlsson had two assists in his second game back after missing 17 games with a groin injury. ... Fleury has allowed at least four goals in all three games since missing nearly three weeks with a lower-body injury.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Rookie Miro Heiskanen scored two goals in his first postseason game, and the Dallas Stars beat the Nashville Predators 3-2 on Wednesday night in Game 1 of their first-round Western Conference series.
Heiskanen became the eighth rookie teenage defenseman in NHL history to score a goal in their first career playoff game and the first since Adam Larsson with New Jersey on May 1, 2012, against Philadelphia, according to NHL Stats. He also became the third-youngest with a multi-goal game and the youngest in franchise history with a postseason goal at 19 years, 266 days.
Mats Zuccarello also scored, helping Dallas continue its success from the regular season in Nashville, where the Stars won twice.
Roman Josi and P.K. Subban each scored for Nashville.
Game 2 of the best-of-seven series is Saturday night in Nashville.
Subban pulled the Predators within a goal with 6:36 left in regulation, beating Ben Bishop's glove with a wrister from the right circle. Nashville got a power play with 4:52 remaining, and coach Peter Laviolette pulled goalie Pekka Rinne with 3:13 left. The Predators couldn't force overtime.
The Predators came in with much more playoff experience after reaching the 2017 Stanley Cup Final and going a full seven games last spring before losing in the second round. The postseason party started as usual with at least one catfish tossed onto the ice and fans who couldn't get into the sold-out Bridgestone Arena watching outside at the park across the street.
This is the first time these Central Division rivals have met in the postseason, timely with Nashville scheduled to play Dallas in the Winter Classic in the Cotton Bowl next season. The Predators came into the playoffs having won five of their last six to win their second straight division title with a win on the final night of the season.
Dallas finished 5-1-1 to grab the first wild card in the West for the Stars' first playoff berth since 2016.
The Stars went with Bishop in net after he posted a career-high seven shutouts during the regular season. He also led the NHL with a .934 save percentage and was second in the league with a 1.98 goals-against average. He made 30 saves for the win.
Josi, who led Nashville with six points in five games against the Stars during the regular season, gave the Predators a 1-0 lead with a backhander from the slot as he skated across at 12:12 of the first.
Nashville forward Brian Boyle, acquired from New Jersey in a trade Feb. 6, sent Stars center Jason Dickinson to the locker room after a collision about 9 minutes into the first. Dickinson returned in the second.
Heiskanen tied it at 12:37 of the second with the puck deflecting off the knee of Predators defenseman Mattias Ekholm. Dallas nearly took the lead off a shot by Roope Hintz with Dickinson following, only to see Rinne stop the puck on the line with the back of his skate 15:00 into the second.
The rookie defenseman scored his second at 6:10 of the third with a similar long shot that beat Rinne with Alexander Radulov in front of the goalie. Zuccarello padded the lead off a rebound, beating Rinne between the legs at 10:39.
NOTES: Heiskanen set a franchise record with 33 points by a teenage defenseman. He also was one of only three Stars to play all 82 games this season. ... The Predators went 35-4-1 this season when scoring first and had been 24-7 all-time when scoring first in the playoffs.

PHOENIX — Lance Lynn struck out nine over six solid innings, Hunter Pence homered into Chase Field's swimming pool and the Texas Rangers rallied after being no-hit for five innings to beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 5-2 Wednesday night.
Lynn (1-1) pitched four-hit ball to help Texas end a four-game skid. The Rangers overcame an excellent start from Arizona's Robbie Ray, who struck out 10 and allowed two hits and a run over five innings.
Andrew Chafin (0-1) pitched out of a bases-loaded, no-out jam in the sixth but was charged with a run an inning later.
Logan Forsythe drove in two for Texas. The Rangers scored two key runs in the top of the ninth off reliever Matt Andriese.
Rangers closer Jose Leclerc, who blew a save chance and a two-run lead Tuesday, loaded the bases with no outs in the bottom of the inning, hitting Carson Kelly and Adam Jones with consecutive pitches after walking Ildemaro Vargas. Leclerc walked Jarrod Dyson to make it 5-2, but Kyle Bird worked out of the jam for his first career save.
The Rangers thwarted Ray's no-hit bid in the sixth with a leadoff single for Delino DeShields. DeShields stole second and took third on a throwing error by Kelly, the catcher. Forsythe singled hard through a drawn-in infield to tie it at 1.
Chafin came on with the bases loaded and struck out Joey Gallo, then got Asdrubal Cabrera to bounce into an inning-ending double play.
The next inning, Chafin walked Isiah Kiner-Falefa, who took second on a sacrifice. One out later, Archie Bradley relieved Chafin and gave up DeShields' run-scoring hit on a 3-1 pitch.
Pence's first home run of the season gave the Rangers a two-run lead in the eighth. Kiner-Falefa beat the throw home on pinch-hitter Rougned Odor's ground ball in the ninth, after the Rangers challenged and the out call was overturned.
Odor later scored on Forsythe's single.
Ray struck out five Rangers in a row between the second and third innings. He also made the game's best defensive play when he hustled off the mound to scoop up DeShields' roller and shoveled the ball from his glove to first base for the first out of the fourth inning.
The Diamondbacks took the lead in the third inning. Eduardo Escobar scored on a wild pitch from Lynn.
Ray allowed only three baserunners through the first five innings, none via a hit. They were Forsythe on catcher's interference in the top of the fourth, Cabrera in the fifth on Escobar's error at third base and a walk to Kiner-Falefa to put two runners on base in the fifth.
The Diamondbacks got a second run taken off the scoreboard in the fifth when Escobar's flyball flew over the fence down the right field line and was originally ruled a home run. After a quick umpire review, the ball was determined to have been hit foul, and Escobar ended up striking out.
RAY WAY
Ray has allowed three or fewer hits in each of his first three starts of the season, the longest such streak in Diamondbacks history. He also has a 1.86 ERA with 56 strikeouts in his last seven starts at home, dating to August. Ray recorded his 17th career game with 10 or more strikeouts.
THIRD CATCHER
The Diamondbacks called up catcher Caleb Joseph from Triple-A Reno before Wednesday's game. Joseph took the place of pitcher Jon Duplantier, who was sent down to Reno to get more work as a starting pitcher.
UP NEXT
Thursday is a day off for the Rangers, and then LHP Drew Smyly (0-1) is scheduled to start against the Oakland Athletics on Friday. RHP Zack Godley (1-1, 6.55 ERA) takes the ball for Arizona on Thursday in the opener of a four-game series with the San Diego Padres.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Trailing by two runs and down to their last strike, the Seattle Mariners found a way to keep their winning streak alive.
""Confidence is building,"" manager Scott Servais said.
Seattle became the first major league team to homer in each of its first 15 games when Dee Gordon connected in the sixth inning, then beat the Kansas City Royals 7-6 Thursday behind Daniel Vogelbach's home run in the 10th.
Seattle improved the best record in the major leagues to 13-2, completing a four-game sweep and extending its winning streak to six. The Mariners became just the third team since 1987 to open with at least 13 wins in the first 15 games after Milwaukee (14-1 in 1987) and Boston (13-2 last year).
Kansas City has lost 10 straight games, has the poorest record in the big leagues at 2-10 and is off to its worst 12-game start since 2006. The Royals failed to preserve leads of 4-0 in the sixth and 6-4 with two outs in the ninth.
""Other teams just can't seem to do any wrong,"" said Kansas City's Whit Merrifield, whose hitting streak ended at 31 games.
Royals center fielder Billy Hamilton was carted off with a knee injury after failing to grab Mitch Haniger's tying, two-run triple in the ninth. Royals manager Ned Yost said he did not have an update on Hamilton's condition.
""Hanny had the at-bat of the game,"" Servais said. ""You're down to your last strike, fighting and clawing. He finally got the changeup up in the zone.""
Merrifield went 0 for 6. He had not gone hitless since Sept. 9.
""Out of my last nine outs, I feel like I've made six good swings on good pitches in the zone,"" Merrifield said. ""I either hit it on the barrel at somebody or just missed it and hit it in the air. That's kind of what makes streaks like these so rare
The 2002 Cleveland Indians had homered in each of their first 14 games. Seattle's 36 home runs are tied with the 2000 St. Louis Cardinals for the most in a club's first 15 games. The Mariners have scored five or more runs in all but one game.
Vogelbach hit a 427-foot drive off Glenn Sparkman (0-1) for his sixth home run this season.
""I'm not in that situation if Hanny doesn't have the at-bat to tie the game,"" Vogelbach said. ""He fouled off a ton of pitches. He made him work, and then got a pitch he could handle.""
Brandon Brennan (1-0) struck out three in the ninth, working around his own throwing error on a grounder to get his first big league win. Brennan has not allowed a run in his first 9 2/3 innings in the major leagues, holding batters to a .156 average (5 for 32).
Connor Sadzeck pitched a perfect 10th for his first professional save.
Seattle trailed 6-3 before Edwin Encarnación hit an RBI single off Wily Peralta in the eighth.
Pinch-hitter Omar Narváez and Gordon singled off Brad Boxberger with one out in the ninth and Mallex Smith took a called third strike. Haniger hit a long drive on a full count and Hamilton, who entered at the start of the half-inning for defense, allowed the ball to glance off his glove on the warning track.
Haniger, who hit a tiebreaking homer with two outs in the ninth inning on Wednesday, slid into third as two runs scored. Hamilton's left knee hit the wall, and he crumpled to the warning track, then was unable to put weight on the knee when he got up.
SWANNY
Mariners RHP Erik Swanson made his major league debut, allowing two runs and three hits in two innings. He is the 18th player and ninth pitcher to make his Mariners debut this season.
MOVES
Royals RHP Jake Newberry was recalled from Omaha, and 1B Frank Schwindel was optioned to the Triple-A farm team.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Mariners: OF Jay Bruce was held out of the lineup with a sore left Achilles. He came out of Wednesday's game after the third inning because of the injury. ... RHP Shawn Armstrong pitched an inning Wednesday night on an injury rehabilitation assignment for Triple-A Tacoma. He is on the 10-day IL with a right-oblique strain.

NEW YORK — Jackie Young said it was a dream come true to be taken first in the WNBA draft.
The Notre Dame guard, who decided to enter the draft early and skip her senior season, was selected No. 1 by the Las Vegas Aces on Wednesday night.
""Since I was a little girl I always wanted to play in the WNBA and now I have my chance,"" she said.
She's the second Irish player to be drafted first after entering early joining Jewell Loyd, who had the honor in 2015.
It's the third consecutive year the Aces have had the No. 1 pick. They took Kelsey Plum in 2017 when the franchise was still in San Antonio. The Aces then drafted A'ja Wilson last season with the No. 1 pick when the franchise moved to Las Vegas.
Young wasn't thrilled that she didn't have much time to make her decision after the Irish lost the championship game Sunday night to Baylor. She had 24 hours to decide whether she wanted to turn pro or go back to play for the Irish.
""It was definitely a hard process for me,"" Young said. ""I had to sit down, talk to my family, talk to Coach (Muffet) McGraw and make the best decision for me.""
Young was the first of five Notre Dame players to be drafted. Arike Ogunbowale went fifth to Dallas. Brianna Turner went 11th to the Atlanta Dream. She was later traded to the Phoenix Mercury for Marie Gulich. Jessica Shepard was taken 16th by the Minnesota Lynx. Marina Mabrey was the fifth Notre Dame player to go, drafted 19th by the Los Angeles Sparks.
""It's a historic moment for our program,"" Notre Dame coach Muffet McGraw said. ""We've had a lot of accomplishments, but this one stands alone. It's probably something that will never happen again. Because of the injury to Bri and Jess coming in, it's atypical of having that kind of class. But it's incredible what they accomplished.""
Tennessee is the only school to have that occur with college players, in 2008. Candace Parker was taken first. Alexis Hornbuckle was drafted fourth. Shannon Bobbitt and Nicky Anosike went back-to-back in the second round and Alberta Auguste was taken in the third round.
Asia Durr went second to the New York Liberty. The Louisville guard, who was a two-time AP All-American, was the No. 2 scorer in school history. The Indiana Fever then took Mississippi State center Teaira McCowan at No. 3. Chicago drafted a UConn player for the second consecutive season taking Katie Lou Samuelson fourth reconnecting her with former Huskies teammate Gabby Williams.
Another UConn player went sixth with Napheesa Collier headed to Minnesota. She could provide some help for the Lynx, who will be missing Maya Moore for the season as she sits out to focus more on things other than basketball. The Lynx had a busy draft taking Shepard and Cierra Dillard of Buffalo in the second round. They also traded Natisha Hiedeman, whom they drafted 16th to Connecticut for Lexie Brown. They drafted Kenisha Bell of Minnesota in the third round.
The Los Angeles Sparks took Baylor center Kalani Brown seventh. It's been a whirlwind 72 hours for the 6-foot-7 center as she helped Baylor win a national championship on Sunday.
Australian Alanna Smith, who helped Stanford win the Pac-12 Tournament title was drafted eighth by Phoenix. The Mercury are coached by fellow Aussie Sandy Brondello. Kristine Anigwe went ninth to Connecticut. The Cal center, who led the nation in rebounding, was the national defensive player of the year. Washington took Kiara Leslie with the 10th pick and Ezi Magbegor closed out the opening round by going to defending champion Seattle.
Chinese sensation Han Xu was drafted 14th by the New York Liberty. The 6-foot-9 center became the first Chinese player drafted since 1997. There was some talk that Han wouldn't be able to play this summer as she would have to compete for the Chinese national team. She said that she expected to play for New York this summer.
The WNBA season opens on May 24th with training camps opening up a few weeks earlier.

KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — Kellie Harper is returning to Tennessee with hopes of rejuvenating one of the biggest brand names in women's college basketball, two decades after playing on three consecutive Lady Vols national championship teams.
Tennessee announced Tuesday it has hired Harper as coach. She will make $750,000 per year.
Harper, who just coached Missouri State to a surprise Sweet 16 appearance, was known as Kellie Jolly when she played for Tennessee from 1995-99. She helped the Lady Vols win national titles in 1996, 1997 and 1998.
She replaces Holly Warlick, who was fired March 27 after going 172-67 in seven seasons. Warlick was an assistant on Pat Summitt's Tennessee staff when Harper was playing for the Lady Vols.
Harper led Missouri State to a 25-10 record and a regional semifinal berth as a No. 11 seed this season. She owns a 118-79 record in six seasons at Missouri State.

NEW YORK — Chris Mullin has ""stepped down"" as basketball coach at St. John's.
Athletic Mike Cragg director announced the decision Tuesday, saying the team ""progressed well"" during Mullin's four years in charge, but he did not detail any reason for the move. Cragg noted Mullin's ""contributions"" and ""deep passion for this program.""
Mullin said in a separate statement he had suffered a ""recent personal loss,"" but he did not elaborate.
Mullin, the greatest player in school history, had two years remaining on his contract. He was coming off his first winning season and only trip to the NCAA Tournament. The Red Storm lost to Arizona State in a First Four game last month.
St. John's went 59-73 under Mullin, including 20-52 in Big East play, after he replaced Steve Lavin in March 2015 and embarked on a substantial rebuild.

BALTIMORE — Jurickson Profar got four hits, including a homer, and drove in a career-high five runs, leading Brett Anderson and the Oakland Athletics over the Baltimore Orioles 13-2 Tuesday night and ending a four-game losing streak.
Slumping Orioles slugger Chris Davis didn't play, a day after he set the major league record for the longest hitless streak by a position player at 0 for 49.
Marcus Semien also homered as the A's won on the road for the first time in five tries this season. Center fielder Ramón Laureano threw out another runner and drove in two runs for Oakland.
Anderson (3-0) won his third straight start, allowing two runs and seven hits in 6 2/3 innings. He retired 11 in a row before Dwight Smith Jr. and Hanser Alberto managed back-to-back singles in the seventh.
Pedro Severino hit a two-run double later that inning that ended Anderson's outing.
Trey Mancini singled in the first and has reached base safely in all 11 games for the Orioles, who have dropped five of their last six.
The Athletics scored five times in the second off rookie John Means (1-1), who was making his first career start. Alberto had a costly throwing error from third base with two outs that allowed a run to score, and Semien followed with a three-run homer that made it 5-0.
The Orioles ran themselves out of a potential rally in the third. Richie Martin was thrown out by Laureano — who threw out three Boston runners in a series earlier this season — trying to score from second on a single by Joey Rickard that could have loaded the bases with no outs. Rickard was then called out trying to take second on a double steal.
Profar hit his first home run of the season off Orioles reliever Richard Bleier in the seventh that provided a 6-0 lead. Profar added another two-run single and Semien had a sacrifice fly off Miguel Castro in the eighth.
Castro had two balks and allowed a two-run single to Laureano and an RBI double to Profar in the ninth.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Athletics: Laureano was back in the lineup after missing Monday's game with a jammed right thumb.
Orioles: RHP Alex Cobb, who was supposed to start Wednesday, was placed on the 10-day injured list retroactive to April 6 with a lumbar strain. He also began the season on the IL with a right groin strain. . RHP Nate Karns (right forearm strain) was placed on the 10-day IL and RHP Evan Phillips was recalled from Triple-A Norfolk.
UP NEXT
Athletics: RHP Frankie Montas (1-1, 2.45 ERA) took the loss in his last outing against Houston after allowing two runs and seven hits over five innings.

DETROIT — Corey Kluber earned his first win of the season in his third start, powered by four Cleveland home runs that sent the Indians over the Detroit Tigers 8-2 on Tuesday.
The Indians won their fifth straight game. Detroit had won five in a row.
Kluber (1-2) allowed one earned run over six innings. A two-time Cy Young Award winner who went 20-7 last season, he struck out eight.
Leonys Martin, Brad Miller, Roberto Perez and Jake Bauers all entered with sub-.200 batting averages before hitting their first homers of the season. Cleveland had hit a total of only four home runs this year before connecting at Comerica Park.
Jordan Zimmermann (0-1) gave up five runs and was chased in the fifth inning. He had allowed just one run in 13 2/3 innings in his first two starts.
Martin homered on the second pitch of the game against his former team, which traded him in July before a bacterial infection ended his season and threatened his life.
Miller added a two-run homer in the second, starting off a 2-for-2 afternoon in which he scored three times.
Perez added a towering shot in the fifth inning, and Bauers homered off reliever Blaine Hardy to make it 6-2 in the sixth.
Eric Stamets singled and scored on a three-base error by center fielder Mikie Mahtook, who let the ball roll under his glove and reach the wall.
Miguel Cabrera had an RBI double and Niko Goodrum had a run-scoring single for the Tigers, who had opened the season winning seven of 10 games. They had been 3-0 at home after sweeping Kansas City over the weekend.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Indians: Starter Mike Clevinger will miss at least six weeks with a back muscle injury. The team announced Clevinger strained his teres major, a muscle in his upper back. Manager Terry Francona said it would be six to eight weeks before he picks up a ball and resumes pitching activity. Clevinger had not allowed an earned run in 12 innings over two starts this season. The Indians called up righty Nick Wittgren, a reliever from Triple-A Columbus.
Tigers: Reliever Drew VerHagen made his season debut after opening the year on the injured list with a forearm strain. He retired the side in order in the ninth, striking out one.
UP NEXT
Indians: RHP Trevor Bauer (1-0, 0.64 ERA) starts Wednesday at Detroit coming off seven innings of no-hit ball on April 5 against Toronto. He has allowed one hit over 14 innings.
Tigers: LHP Matthew Boyd (0-1, 3.18) starts for the first time since his 13-strikeout outing, a career high, April 3 against the Yankees.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Whit Merrifield has extended his hitting streak to 30 games, matching the Kansas City Royals' team record set by George Brett.
Merrifield led off the bottom of the first inning with an opposite-field triple to right on Tuesday night against Seattle.
Merrifield ended last season with a hit in 20 straight games, and has gotten a hit in all 10 Royals games this year. He owns the longest streak in the majors since Atlanta's Freddie Freeman had a 30-game string in 2016.
Brett had a 30-game streak for the Royals in 1980, the year he batted .390. The major league record is a 56-game hitting streak by Joe DiMaggio in 1941.
Merrifield's streak is the longest multi-season string since Jimmy Rollins hit in 38 straight in 2005-06 for Philadelphia.
This is the 16th longest in American League history. Eric Davis was the last AL player to hit in 30 straight, doing it in 1998 for Baltimore.

ANAHEIM, Calif. — Mike Trout homered for the fourth straight game and the Los Angeles Angels, after waiting out a five-minute delay caused by a swarm of bees, beat the Texas Rangers 7-2 on Sunday.
Trout hit five home runs in the four-game series — he became the fourth Angels player to connect five times in a set.
The two-time AL MVP went 6 for 11 with nine RBIs in the series. He hit a two-run drive off Kyle Bird in the sixth inning for a 6-2 lead.
Play was stopped in the fifth when the bees began flying around the bullpens in left center field at Angel Stadium. Bird was warming up and kept throwing while swatting away the insects.
Many fans cleared out of the area until the bees eventually left.
Brian Goodwin also homered for the Angels, who have won three in a row following a five-game losing streak. Justin Anderson (2-0) threw a scoreless inning in relief.
Joey Gallo hit a two-run homer for the Rangers. Shelby Miller (0-1) gave up four runs on four hits and three walks and hit one batter in two innings.
The Angels scored four times in the second. Jonathan Lucroy had an RBI single, Zack Cozart was hit by a pitch to tie it at 2, David Fletcher singled home a run and another scored on Tommy La Stella's groundout.

Angels OF Justin Upton figured he might miss a couple of weeks at most after injuring the big toe on his left foot in a collision with the outfield wall in an exhibition game, so he couldn't believe it when told the diagnosis of turf toe would keep him out for up to three months.
""I wasn't happy about it, obviously,"" Upton said. ""But nothing I can really do about it at this point except take it and try to get better while I'm down.""
Upton, who is limited to range of motion exercises while he remains in a walking boot for the next two to three weeks, joked he had not been in contact with any offensive linemen for rehabilitation tips after sustaining an injury associated more with football than baseball.

SAN FRANCISCO — Tampa Bay manager Kevin Cash kept getting the most from his pitching staff, moving reliever Adam Kolarek to first base in a piece of matchup strategy, and the Rays blanked the San Francisco Giants 3-0 Sunday.
Yandy Diaz homered on the second pitch of the game and Yonny Chirinos (2-0) threw five scoreless innings. The Rays have opened the season with three straight series wins for the first time in franchise history.
Kolarek pitched a perfect sixth inning to protect a 2-0 lead, then had two different stints on the mound in the seventh. The left-hander gave up a leadoff single to pinch-hitter Yangervis Solarte before shifting over to play first base — it was his first time in the majors at a position other than pitcher, and allowed the Rays to bring in right-hander reliever Chaz Roe.
Roe struck out righty-hitting Evan Longoria and exited. Kolarek returned to the mound, struck out lefty-swinging Brandon Belt, gave up another single and was replaced for good by Diego Castillo.
Cash used relief pitchers as starters for an inning or two last year with great success. Chirinos made his second strong appearance this season, allowing two hits and a walk and striking out five. On March 31 versus Houston, he gave up one run on two hits in seven innings.
Drew Pomeranz (0-1) lasted four innings, permitting two runs on six hits, walking three and striking out five. But the Giants provided no offensive support, managing five hits, all singles.
The Rays' other runs came on Christian Arroyo's RBI single in the fourth and when Kevin Kiermaier tripled in the eighth and scored on a balk.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Rays: Cash said infielder Joey Wendle, who has been on the 10-day disabled list since April 1, won't be ready to play for a few days even after he's eligible to come off the DL on April 11.
Giants: RHP Johnny Cueto is eligible to come off the 60-day disabled list on April 14 after having Tommy John surgery last year. . C Buster Posey got a rest day on Sunday.
UP NEXT
Rays: LHP Blake Snell (1-1, 3.46) takes the mound as the Rays continue their nine-game road trip at the Chicago White Sox.
Giants: LHP Madison Bumgarner (0-2, 1.38) pitches against San Diego as San Francisco plays the fourth game of its 10-game homestand. Bumgarner is 1-5 in his last eight starts against the Padres.
PHAM'S STREAK
With his first-inning single, Tommy Pham has now reached base in 42 straight games, extending the longest streak in Tampa Bay history. It is the longest streak in the majors since Houston's Alex Bregman had a similar 42-game streak last year.

Former Alabama wide receiver and New York Jets draft pick ArDarius Stewart was arrested in Tuscaloosa, Ala., Thursday for carrying a pistol without a permit, AL.com reported.
Stewart was being held on $500 bond, according to the report.
Stewart was selected by the Jets in the third round of the 2017 draft after a decorated career with the Crimson Tide. Stewart caught 129 passes for 1,713 yards and 12 touchdowns at Alabama in three years.
Stewart played 15 games as a rookie for the Jets but caught just six passes for 82 yards before being cut in 2018 in the aftermath of a two-game suspension for testing positive for a performance enhancing drug.
The Raiders and Redskins signed Stewart to their practice squads late last year and both teams released him shortly thereafter, most recently the Redskins in January.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Jerry Stackhouse had a couple interviews already lined up for possible NBA head coaching jobs. He says he decided to take a college job because of his relationship with Vanderbilt's new athletic director and the opportunity to turnaround the Commodores men's program.
Stackhouse said during a news conference on Monday that he loves is teaching and coaching basketball, and he wants to bring back Memorial magic to the oldest arena in the Southeastern Conference.
His lone head coaching experience is two years in the G League where he got to know a fellow North Carolina graduate in Malcolm Turner, who was the league's president. Turner took over as athletic director at Vanderbilt on Feb. 1.
Stackhouse has been an assistant with the NBA's Memphis Grizzlies this season, and the 18-year NBA veteran also was an assistant in Toronto.
Vanderbilt is coming off the worst season ever at 9-23, finishing the season on a 20-game skid.

MILAN — Defying the economics of modern European football, unheralded Atalanta are threatening to deny AC Milan their long-awaited return to the Champions League.
With another Juventus title win now a formality -- a draw at SPAL on Saturday will earn the Turin side an eighth successive Scudetto with six games to spare -- the real excitement in Serie A is now in the race for the Champions League slots.
Atalanta have never played in Europe's flagship competition, and would not have initially been considered as contenders for one of the four places.
The Bergamo outfit are the sort of middle-ranking European club who, as soon as they have a good season, see their best players snapped up by bigger clubs, have to start all over again and often slip back into obscurity.
Remarkably, however, Atalanta have refused to lie down and, with seven games left, are level on 52 points with fourth-placed Milan. They are followed by Roma (51) and Lazio and Torino (49).
While Milan and Lazio meet on Saturday, Atalanta have a relatively straightforward match at home to lowly Empoli on Monday.
After finishing fourth in 2016-17, Atalanta almost inevitably lost two top players as Andrea Conti and Franck Kessie left for AC Milan, while midfielder Roberto Gagliardini had joined Inter Milan halfway through the season.
But they rebuilt and enjoyed another impressive season in 2017-18 when they finished seventh in Serie A, reached the Coppa Italia semi-finals and topped their Europa League group.
Although they showed signs of cracking early this season, Atalanta have instead bounced back stronger than ever.
They are Serie A's joint top scorers alongside Juventus, with 64 goals in 31 games, and have reached the Coppa Italia semi-finals after eliminating the Turin side with a 3-0 win.
In playmaker Alejandro Gomez, the gifted Josip Ilicic and powerful goalscorer Duvan Zapata, they have arguably Serie A's most potent attacking trio, even if that is partly offset by a leaky defence.
Coach Gian Piero Gasperini insisted recently that he was still aiming for the Europa League rather than the Champions League.
""The Champions is not our target,"" he said. ""We will be happy just go get back into Europe -- we are aiming for the Europa League or to win the Coppa Italia.""
Even after Sunday's 0-0 draw away to third-placed Inter Milan, he shied away from Champions League talk.
""We’re not trying to be modest but we know there is a very tough road ahead,"" he said. ""We’ll see how we do, week by week.""
But former captain Massimo Carrera was more optimistic. ""It's right to aim for the Champions League,"" he told Gazzetta dello Sport, putting their success down to Gasperini.
""He always gets the best out of his players. Every year, the club sells important players, but he always does it all over again. There's nothing to add - he's a real football maestro.""

(Reuters) - West Ham United boss Manuel Pellegrini blamed injuries for his team's inconsistent Premier League performances this season but backed them to push for unlikely Europa League qualification.
Injuries to the likes of Andriy Yarmolenko, Manuel Lanzini and Jack Wilshere have robbed Pellegrini of options for parts of their campaign, leaving the Hammers 11th in the table with 42 points from 33 games and the former Manchester City boss to reflect on a mixed first season back in the English top flight.
""If you ask if it's a good season ... before the finish we are not fighting against relegation with an average of five or six players not available,"" Pellegrini told reporters ahead of Saturday's league game at sixth-placed Manchester United.
""From that point of view, it's not a bad season. For me the most important reason for any inconsistency is the amount of players we couldn't use. That's the only reason we couldn't do better than we have.
""We must demand more. We must try to play every game with improvement and evolve. We still have a mathematical chance for Europe and we must try for that.""
Striker Andy Carroll, who missed the first four months of the season, is set for more time on the sidelines after another ankle operation.
Midfielder Samir Nasri is a doubt with a muscle problem but Pellegrini had better news on Wilshere, who is recovering from an ankle injury that has kept him out since December.
""Wilshere is almost ready,"" the Chilean said. ""He played an under-23s game last week and he'll play another one. Hopefully next week he'll be 100 percent with us.""

LOS ANGELES — Magic Johnson abruptly quit as the Los Angeles Lakers' president of basketball operations Tuesday night, citing a desire to get back to the simpler life he enjoyed before taking over the franchise just over two years ago.
Johnson didn't tell owner Jeanie Buss or general manager Rob Pelinka before he stepped in front of reporters about 90 minutes before the final game of the Lakers' sixth consecutive losing season.
Johnson didn't directly tie his decision to the future of coach Luke Walton, who was widely expected to be fired by Johnson soon. But Johnson repeatedly mentioned Buss' affinity for Walton and Johnson's desire not to cause upheaval between them.
Johnson also says he's tired of being fined by the NBA for tampering.

ST. LOUIS — Adam Wainwright was in vintage form Sunday, pitching six sharp innings as the St. Louis Cardinals avoided a three-game sweep by beating the San Diego Padres 4-1.
The Padres hadn't swept a series in St. Louis since 1980, and Wainwright (1-0) prevented it from happening this time at Busch Stadium.
The 37-year-old Wainwright gave up one run and five hits. He struck out nine and didn't issue a walk while throwing 100 pitches.
The longtime star of the St. Louis rotation was injured for most of last season, going just 2-4 in eight starts. He struggled in his first outing this year, giving up four runs on four hits and four walks in four innings at Pittsburgh.
Eric Hosmer had an RBI single in the third for the Padres, who had won three in a row. San Diego's other four hits off Wainwright were doubles.
Jordan Hicks recorded four outs for his first save in two chances. He struck out Manny Machado with a runner on to end the eighth.
Paul DeJong drove in a pair of runs with a fourth-inning double off Matt Strahm (0-2). Matt Carpenter walked and Paul Goldschmidt reached when left fielder Hunter Renfroe lost the ball in the sun. Renfroe was given an error on the play.
Carpenter added a run-scoring sacrifice fly in the seventh. Kolten Wong and Jose Martinez began the inning with back-to-back singles.
Wong pushed the lead to 4-1 with an infield single in the eighth. It brought in Yadier Molina, who led off the inning with single, his third hit of the game.
St. Louis center fielder Harrison Bader made a pair of running catches and also threw out Renfroe at third on a fly ball to end the third.
YADI ON THE RISE
Molina moved into seventh place on the Cardinals all-time hit list with 1,857. He passed Ken Boyer, who had 1,855.

TORONTO — Devils General Manager Ray Shero has made it clear his team needs to accumulate more talent.
The luck of the draw helped the Devils take a step in that direction Tuesday.
The Devils will pick first at June’s N.H.L. draft after the lottery balls fell in their favor — bumping the franchise up to the top spot from No. 3.
Shero would not tip his hand after the order was revealed, but
the presumptive No. 1 pick, Jack Hughes
, was already on everyone’s mind.
“I’ve seen Jack play a long time,” Shero said of the 17-year-old center who plays for the United States National Development Team. “We recognize Jack’s a great young player.”
The Rangers will choose second at the draft — the team’s first top-2 selection since 1966, when they grabbed the future Hall of Fame defenseman Brad Park.
The night’s other big winner was the Chicago Blackhawks, who went from No. 12 to No. 3 despite having just a 2.5 percent chance of securing the top selection.
Tuesday marked the second time in three years the Devils, who had an 11.5 percent chance of getting the top pick, have won the lottery. In 2007, they moved from fifth to first and
selected center Nico Hischier
.
The Devils also have three second-round picks and two thirds at the draft in Vancouver as the club looks to rebound from a disappointing season.
“Getting Nico was a big step,” Shero said. “And doing this again, you have to be lucky, you have to have not a great year, obviously.
“We want to fix that.”
The night’s big losers were the Colorado Avalanche and the Los Angeles Kings.
The Avalanche, who open the playoffs Wednesday against the Calgary Flames, had the best odds of landing the first pick at 18.5 percent after acquiring the selection from the Ottawa Senators in the trade for Matt Duchene in November 2017. Instead Colorado fell down to the No. 4 slot.
The Avalanche also dropped from first to fourth three years ago before selecting defenseman Cale Makar.
Ottawa, which finished last in the overall standings this season, could have sent the team’s first pick at last June’s draft to the Avalanche, but kept the selection and took winger Brady Tkachuk at No. 4.
Los Angeles, meanwhile, had the second-best odds of winning the lottery at 13.5 percent, but will pick fifth.
The 15 teams that failed to qualify for the 2019 playoffs — or the franchises that acquired the first-round picks of non-playoff clubs — participated in the lottery.
Hughes holds the U.S. National Development Team record with 197 points (63 goals and 134 assists) over his two seasons after putting up 86 in 41 games in 2018-19.
Asked if he’s always wanted to an N.H.L. star, he responded with a smile: “I didn’t really dream of being a grinder.”
Hughes, who was born in Orlando, Fla., but grew up in Mississauga, Ontario, skates with Devils winger Taylor Hall in the summer.
Hall has had some incredible luck with the lottery balls in his career. Of the nine drafts since he entered the league as the No. 1 pick by the Edmonton Oilers in 2010, his team has picked first five times.
“Very excited to welcome our future #1 overall pick to Jersey!”
Hall tweeted
. “Great start to the summer for the Devils.”
Hughes could become the second player to be chosen first overall directly out of the U.S.N.D.T. — and the first to go right to the N.H.L. — after the St. Louis Blues took defenseman Erik Johnson at No. 1 in 2006.
“I’m focused on playing in the N.H.L. next year,” said Hughes, who turns 18 on May 14. “I feel like I could do it. With the way the game is now, how it’s speed and skill, I feel like my game translates perfectly.”
Winger Kaapo Kakko, 18, of Finland is ranked as the top European skater and is expected to go No. 2 at the draft. He set a Finnish league record with 22 goals in his rookie season to go along with 16 assists for 38 points in 45 games. He added two goals and three assists in seven games at the world junior tournament.
Rangers General Manager Jeff Gorton said moving up to No. 2 will help move his team’s rebuild along.
“My phone’s in my back pocket buzzing like crazy,” he said. “I haven’t been able to look at it, but I can only imagine what people are saying.”

MINNEAPOLIS — The NCAA Tournament will take an ugly turn in its final or, depending on your perspective, be a masterpiece in defensive basketball.
The national title game Monday night pits Virginia (34-3), the standard-bearer in lockdown basketball, against the new kids on the defensive block, the Texas Tech Red Raiders (31-6).
The over/under for points is 118. The over/under on bruises may be higher.
""People have been all over how bad the Final Four is going to be, the final game, the low scoring, whatever,"" Sacramento State coach Brian Katz said. ""I love it. It's great defense. Fun to watch. If you're the casual fan and you've got one hand in the popcorn and beer, you're waiting around looking for the big dunk or whatever, you're probably bored. If you're really into the game, you get it.""
Here are a few things to know before watching what's expected to be one of the lowest-scoring games in title game history:
FIRST TIME CHAMPION
The NCAA Tournament will have its first first-time champion since coach Billy Donovan won it all with Florida in 2006.
Texas Tech reached the Elite Eight for the first time last season and Virginia lost its previous two trips to the Final Four, in 1981 and 1984.
The last time two teams who had never won a championship played in the title game was Michigan State against Indiana State in 1979. That's right, Magic Johnson vs. Larry Bird.
VIRGNIA'S TIGHTROPE
Virginia had two close calls to reach its first title game.
The Cavaliers survived a scoring onslaught by Carsen Edwards (42 points) and forced overtime on Mamadi Diakite's short jumper to beat Purdue in double overtime in the Elite Eight.
Virginia had another nail biter in the Final Four, beating Auburn 63-62 on Kyle Guy's three free throws with 0.6 seconds left. Down 2 with 1.5 seconds left, the Cavaliers got the ball to Guy, who was fouled by Auburn's Samir Doughty on a 3-point attempt. He sank all three free throws to send the Cavaliers to the title game.
OWENS' STATUS
Texas Tech outmuscled Michigan State 61-51 in its Final Four game Saturday night, but saw Tariq Owens roll his right ankle in the second half. The shot-blocking senior returned after taping his ankle up, but Red Raiders coach Chris Beard declined to give an update Sunday. Playing without Owens would be a huge loss for Texas Tech.
CAVALIER TURNAROUND
Should Virginia win Monday night, it will likely go down as one of the biggest turnarounds in college basketball history.
A year ago, the Cavaliers became the first No. 1 seed to lose to a No. 16 when they were knocked off by Baltimore-Maryland County in the first round.
Virginia has used the historic loss as motivation all season and is on the cusp of erasing it with the biggest victory in program history.
THE SCORERS
Virginia is led by the three-headed monster of Guy, De'Andre Hunter and Ty Jerome. Guy hit a late 3-pointer before the three massive free throws against Auburn. Jerome was the catalyst early against the Tigers and finished with 21 points. Hunter came alive after quiet first half, finishing with 15 points.
Texas Tech's trio of Jarrett Culver, Davide Moretti and Matt Mooney do the most offensive damage for the Red Raiders.
Mooney was money against Michigan State, hitting three straight 3-pointers to give the Red Raiders a 10-point cushion. Culver took over when the Spartans started paying more attention to him, scoring six straight points to stave off a Spartans charge.
Though quiet against Michigan State, Moretti can get hot in a hurry, as he did earlier in the bracket.

Oklahoma quarterback Kyler Murray will be in Nashville on April 25 for the first round of the NFL draft. Where he goes from there remains to be seen.
Murray is one of 23 prospects who plan to attend the draft later this month, the NFL announced Tuesday. He stands a chance to be one of the top picks, if not the No. 1 overall selection, after passing for 4,361 yards, 42 touchdowns and seven interceptions in 2018.
Quarterbacks Daniel Jones of Duke and Drew Lock of Missouri also plan to be at the draft, while another top quarterback, Dwayne Haskins of Ohio State, will not be there. The other 20 players include six defensive linemen, four offensive linemen, three linebackers, two defensive backs, two wide receivers, two tight ends and a running back.
Murray reportedly headed to Phoenix on Tuesday for another meeting with the Arizona Cardinals, who hold the No. 1 overall draft pick.
--The NFL and NFL Players Association announced they will take part in regularly scheduled meetings to discuss a new collective bargaining agreement.
The NFL and NFLPA issued the following statement: ""Today, the members of the NFL's Management Council and the NFLPA's Executive Committee met to discuss negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement. The League and the Union have committed to meet regularly in the coming months, which will involve staff, NFL leadership, members of the NFLPA Executive Committee and Player Representation.""
The league and its players most recently agreed upon a collective bargaining agreement in 2011. The deal, which was reached after a player lockout, runs through the end of the 2020 season. Both sides hope that starting negotiations early may help to avoid a work stoppage after the end of next season.
--The New England Patriots and kicker Stephen Gostkowski agreed to a two-year contract, ESPN reported.
Gostkowski, 35, has been the club's kicker since 2006. He replaced Adam Vinatieri, who had departed to the Indianapolis Colts as a free agent.
Gostkowski, a four-time Pro Bowl selection, has made 367 of 420 field-goal attempts during 13 seasons with New England. He was 27 of 32 last season.
--The NFL released the 65-game 2019 preseason schedule, kicking off with the Hall of Fame game between the Denver Broncos and Atlanta Falcons on Aug. 1 in Canton, Ohio.
Other highlights include the Dallas Cowboys facing the Los Angeles Rams in Honolulu on Aug. 17, the NFL's first preseason contest at Aloha Stadium since 1976.
The Super Bowl LIII champion New England Patriots will square off against the New York Giants in the preseason finale for the 15th straight season.
--The Atlanta Falcons signed veteran defensive end Adrian Clayborn to a one-year deal, the team announced. Official terms were not disclosed, but multiple outlets reported that he could earn up to $4 million with incentives.
Clayborn, who played for the Falcons from 2015-17, appeared in 14 games for the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots last season and tallied 2.5 sacks.
Clayborn, 30, has registered 32.5 career sacks and 90 quarterback hits in 95 games (51 starts) with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Falcons and Patriots.
--Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers said in an interview with ESPN Milwaukee that he ""lost vision"" after sustaining a concussion in the final game of last season.
Rodgers also went into detail about the knee injury he sustained in Week 1 and then aggravated in Week 5. Rodgers left the Week 1 game against the Chicago Bears but returned to engineer the 20-point comeback victory.
""I had a tibial plateau fracture and obviously an MCL sprain,"" Rodgers told ESPN, ""so that was very painful. If you watch the hit back, just my two bones here that come together on the outside just kind of made an indent fracture. Very painful.""

LOS ANGELES — Ilya Kovalchuk had two goals, Dustin Brown had two assists and the last-place Los Angeles Kings closed the season with a 5-2 victory over the playoff-bound Vegas Golden Knights on Saturday night.
Anze Kopitar had a goal and an assist for Los Angeles while Jeff Carter and Matt Roy also had goals. Jonathan Quick made 29 saves.
The Kings finished last in the Western Conference with 71 points, but won six of its last 11 games.
Brandon Pirri and Valentin Zykov scored for Vegas, which is the seventh team in NHL history to make the playoffs in each of its first two seasons. The Golden Knights, third in the Pacific Division, will open the Stanley Cup Playoffs at San Jose. Mark-Andre Fleury made 27 saves.
Kovalchuk stripped the puck from Zykov in the neutral zone and skated up the left side of the ice before beating Fleury on his glove side at 12:14 of the first. It was Kovalchuk's first goal since March 2.
Carter extended the lead with five minutes remaining in the first when he was able to cash in on a rebound of his own shot for his 13th. Fleury made pad saves on the first two attempts before Carter got his third goal this season against the Golden Knights.
Roy got his second of the season at 10:35 of the second with a shot that went in off the crossbar after taking a pass from Brown.
Vegas then scored two goals less than three minutes apart. The Golden Knights got on the board 16 seconds after Roy's goal when Pirri got a loose puck near the right faceoff circle and fired a slap shot past Quick for his 12th
Zykov got the Golden Knights with his second of the season at 13:09 when he put in the net on a perfect pass from Jimmy Schuldt, who was playing in his first NHL game. Quick came out too far in front of the net, which left Zykov open.
Kopitar provided some breathing room 8:52 into the third with a power-play goal. Kopitar tapped in the loose puck for his 22nd after a mad scramble in the crease. Kovalchuk added an empty-netter with 55 seconds remaining for his 16th.
NOTES: Vegas D Nate Schmidt, D Shea Theodore, RW Reilly Smith and RW Mark Stone were all healthy scratches as the Golden Knights get set for the playoffs. ... The five goals prevented Los Angeles from having the fewest goals in the NHL this season. They finished with 202, two more than Anaheim. It was the fifth-fewest goals the Kings have scored in an 82-game season. ... Kopitar, who played in his 1,000th NHL game last Monday, was honored before the game. ... Los Angeles C Blake Lizotte, who was a teammate of Schuldt's at St. Cloud State, also made his NHL debut. Both signed their entry-level contracts earlier in the week.

(Reuters) - Leicester City have been charged for failing to control their players during Saturday's Premier League win over Huddersfield Town, the English Football Association (FA) said on Wednesday.
The club were charged for an incident in the 51st minute when referee David Coote gave a penalty for a foul by Leicester defender Caglar Soyuncu on Karlan Grant and a number of players appeared to remonstrate with the match officials.
""It is alleged the club failed to ensure its players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion,"" the FA said in a statement.
Leicester have until April 12 to respond to the charge.
Midfielder Aaron Mooy scored the penalty for Huddersfield but Leicester went on to claim a convincing 4-1 victory.

MILAN — Vincenzo Montella returned for a second stint as Fiorentina coach on Wednesday after the Serie A club named him as their replacement for Stefano Pioli who quit in acrimonious circumstances on Tuesday.
The 44-year-old was in charge for three seasons between 2012 and 2015 and enjoyed remarkable consistency, leading Fiore to three successive fourth places in Serie A. They also reached the Coppa Italia final and the Europa League semi-finals.
Fiorentina, who are 10th in Serie A and have reached the Coppa Italia semi-finals, announced his appointment on their website and said he had signed a contract until June 2021.
After leaving Fiore, Montella was coach of AC Milan for just under 18 months and Sevilla for four months.
Fiorentina have won only one of their last 11 matches in all competitions and suffered a shock 1-0 defeat at home to second-bottom Frosinone on Sunday.
On Monday, the club issued a statement strongly criticising the team’s recent performances but said it wanted Pioli, in charge for one year and 10 months, to lead the recovery.
It asked Pioli to ""handle this situation with the competence and seriousness he showed in the first half of the championship.""
PIOLI QUITS
On Tuesday, Pioli resigned, saying his professional and human abilities had been called into question.
""I have always assumed my responsibilities, I have always guaranteed professionalism, respect and maximum commitment in my work,"" he added.
The exchange continued on Wednesday as the club issued another statement.
""We consider his attitude incomprehensible and unjustifiable, putting the club in an unexpected situation that is complicated to manage,"" it said.
""It was a duty to clarify the position of the club and to call for the utmost commitment from everyone without offending or belittling anyone.""
Fiorentina routinely finish in the top half of Serie A although they have not won a trophy since the Coppa Italia in 2001 and the last of their two league titles was in 1969.
They showed all their potential in thrashing AS Roma 7-1 in a Coppa Italia quarter-final in January but since then their form has dropped.

NEW YORK — Max Scherzer got his first win, Anthony Rendon hit a three-run homer and the Washington National were helped by 12 walks in a 12-9 win over the New York Mets on Sunday.
Scherzer (1-2) allowed four runs and eight hits in 6 1/3 innings with seven strikeouts, no walks and two hit batters, and he also singled in the game's first run. He lost his opening two starts for the first time in his big league career, to the Mets and Philadelphia, though he did go 0-3 over his first six starts in 2009.
Washington took two of three from their NL East rival. The Nationals opened a 12-1 lead by the seventh inning, when Rendon hit his fourth home run of the season, a drive off the facing of the second deck in left-center. Kurt Suzuki had two hits and two RBIs. Aside from Scherzer, every Nationals starter walked at least once.
Zack Wheeler (0-1) struggled to command his fastball and gave up seven runs, four hits and a career-high seven walks in 4 2/3 innings, throwing strikes on just 51 of 103 pitches. Reliever Tim Peterson threw a run-scoring wild pitch to his first batter and walked five, including one with the bases loaded. Mets pitchers had not walked 12 in a nine-inning game since March 31, 2003, on opening day against the Chicago Cubs.
Washington took a 5-0 lead in the second, which included Victor Robles' RBI single, Adam Eaton's two-run double and Howie Kendrick's sacrifice fly, his first RBI since May 13. Kendrick returned Saturday from a ruptured right Achilles' tendon sustained last May 19.
Mired in a 2-for-27 slump, Brandon Nimmo doubled in a run off of Scherzer in the seventh. Rookie Pete Alonso hit a three-run homer against Matt Grace later in the inning, the rookie's third home run this season.
WILD MAN
Nationals reliever Trevor Rosenthal hit a batter, threw two wild pitches and issued a walk in the eighth. Attempting to come back from Tommy John surgery, the former All-Star closer has not retired any of the nine batters he's faced this season, allowing seven runs.
RELIEF REINFORCEMENTS
Washington recalled RHP Joe Ross from Triple-A Fresno and optioned INF Adrián Sanchez to Double-A Harrisburg. Usually a starter, Ross got just one out in the ninth before giving up Michael Conforto's three-run homer. According to manager Dave Martinez, Ross will be used in relief to aid an ineffective bullpen that had a major league-worst 10.02 ERA entering Sunday.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Nationals: CF Michael A. Taylor (sprained right knee and hip) went 1 for 5 Sunday for Harrisburg as the designated hitter.
Mets: C Travis d'Arnaud (Tommy John surgery) was reinstated from the 10-day IL, pinch hit in the seventh and moved behind the plate in his first major league appearance since April 8 last year. He grounded out and flied out.
UP NEXT
Nationals: RHP Aníbal Sánchez (0-0, 9.00 ERA) faces RHP Vince Velasquez (0-0, 0.00) Monday night as Washington opens a three-game series at Philadelphia.
Mets: RHP Jacob deGrom (2-0), who has not allowed a run in 13 innings this season, is scheduled to start Tuesday's series opener against Minnesota and RHP Kyle Gibson (0-0, 9.64).

The Boston Red Sox received their latest World Series rings on Tuesday, and this version — their fourth in the last 15 seasons — is
a beauty
. Encircling the facing are two rows of 128 total diamonds, symbolizing the franchise’s nine overall championships and its 119 victories in 2018. The inscription under the band is not subtle: TEAM FOR THE AGES.
So it was. The Red Sox were so dominant last October that they lost only once in each of their three postseason series. In their first three series of this season, though, they won only once apiece. They lost their home opener, too, leaving their record at 3-9 before Thursday night’s game against the Toronto Blue Jays.
The easy explanation is the schedule: The Red Sox were the last team to play at home this season, opening on the road against the Seattle Mariners, the Oakland Athletics and the Arizona Diamondbacks before finally staggering back to Fenway Park. No other defending champion had ever played its first 11 games on the road.
Then again, any rough part of a schedule always, by definition, creates an easier patch later. The Red Sox have already finished their longest road trip of the season, and they will play 13 of their final 22 games at Fenway. The Yankees, on the other hand, will play just six of their final 21 games in the Bronx.
By then, perhaps, the Tampa Bay Rays will have run away with the American League East. The Rays were Boston’s mirror image through 12 games, with a 9-3 record. While Tampa Bay starters had a major league-best 1.77 earned run average in those games, Boston starters had a major league-worst
8.78 E.R.A.
How bad is an 8.78 E.R.A. through 12 starts? To put it in an individual context, consider that only seven pitchers have ever had a higher E.R.A. in a season of 12 or more starts. One of them was the Pittsburgh Pirates’
Steve Blass
in 1973, when he suddenly lost the ability to throw strikes. The mysterious condition has since been known colloquially as Steve Blass Disease.
The early failure of the Red Sox rotation is only slightly less startling than the woes of Blass, who had starred in the playoffs the previous fall and thrown the final pitch of the World Series the year before that. Chris Sale — who collected the final out for the Red Sox at Dodger Stadium last October — is 0-3 with a 9.00 E.R.A., a confounding start for a pitcher who signed a five-year, $145 million contract extension last month.
Sale, 30, has actually not yet begun that deal; it runs from 2020 through 2024. While he closed out last season in a scripted moment of triumph — the Red Sox had a four-run lead in Game 5 and had squeezed the life from the Dodgers — he has not pitched more the six innings in a start since before the All-Star break last July. Sale was bothered by shoulder trouble down the stretch and worked just 30⅓ innings in his final eight starts, including the postseason.
The Red Sox were satisfied enough with the condition of Sale’s shoulder to give him the new contract. But Sale’s average fastball velocity has dipped to 91.3 miles per hour this season,
according to Fangraphs
, down from 94.7 last season. He has thrown 88 fastballs so far, according to MLB.com, and generated just two swinging strikes.
“I’m struggling,” Sale told reporters after Tuesday’s 7-5 loss, in which he lasted just four innings. “I don’t know if I’ve ever pitched like this in my life.”
The Red Sox did not expect to worry about their rotation. Their starters all made relief cameos last postseason, eager to contribute to a title run and expertly deployed by Manager Alex Cora. In spring training, Cora limited their workload — even more than he had the year before — with an eye on the long game.
“We want them to be great the whole season, but we don’t want them to be in a situation where they come in April and they’re great, but throughout the season they’re going down, down, down,” Cora said in March. “Every game counts, obviously, from March 28 all the way to the end of the regular season, but we want them to be consistent, and I think they understand that.”
With their farm system largely depleted by trades, the Red Sox have invested heavily in their starters. Sale, David Price, Rick Porcello, Nathan Eovaldi and Eduardo Rodriguez will combine to make about $88.5 million this season, more than
the entire payroll
of the Pittsburgh Pirates, the Baltimore Orioles, the Miami Marlins or the Rays.
Yet the Red Sox have met the minimum requirements for a quality start (at least six innings, no more than three earned runs) just once so far: on April 2 in Oakland, when Sale allowed one run over six innings, with only one strikeout.
There are encouraging signs. The Red Sox bullpen — minus Craig Kimbrel, the unsigned free agent closer — has performed well, with a 3.61 E.R.A. All of the major position players are healthy. The starters have a proven track record.
But no team has repeated as World Series champions since 2000, before baseball began testing for performance-enhancing drugs. The toll of three postseason rounds — without the same access to shortcuts for physical recovery — appears to be real.
For inspiration, the Red Sox could look to another Boston team that recovered from an even worse beginning to win a championship: The 1914 Boston Braves started 3-16 yet romped to a pennant and upended the Philadelphia A’s to win the World Series.
Of course, history knows that team as the Miracle Braves — and it just might take another miracle for the Red Sox to stage an encore of the team for the ages.

AUGUSTA Ga. (Reuters) - Augusta National patrons have proven for decades to be a different breed from fans at any other sporting event, providing a sort of golfing oasis for the world's best players each year during the Masters.
At Augusta National, where the Masters began on Thursday after three heavily-attended practice days, one might have better luck booking a tee time at the exclusive course than finding anyone doing things like shouting out of line or using a cell phone.
Augusta National has essentially managed to maintain a remarkable sense of civility and respect among those attending the Masters, despite operating in a time where sporting events often produce excessive fan behavior.
""It's quite refreshing to have everything in control,"" said twice major champion Martin Kaymer of Germany. ""You know what you are going to get here. It's a very peaceful place.
""Everybody behaves perfectly fine, it's very respectful and I think sometimes we miss that in sport. So that's why it's a good week to come to.""
Augusta National prides itself on tradition and while the club's strictly-enforced rules may not make sense to everyone who attends the year's biggest golfing event the list of no-nos are, for the most part, followed to a tee.
And so it is no surprise that the first page of the Masters Spectator Guide begins with a passage written by club co-founder Robert Jones in 1967 that addresses conduct, customs and etiquette.
""In golf, customs of etiquette and decorum are just as important as rules governing play,"" Jones wrote, going on to add that ""most distressing to those who love the game of golf is the applauding or cheering of misplays or misfortunes of a player.""
NO RUNNING
In many ways, Augusta National operates in a world of its own and has created an aura about itself that has appeared to permeate almost anyone who walks through its gates.
As such, you are unlikely to see people sprawled out on the course's luscious grass, and if you do it will not be for long as they will quickly be asked to sit up properly. Running is also considered unacceptable.
""There's something about Augusta National when someone walks through the gates, they know that it's a place of respect, of beauty, and honoring traditions and values of the game,"" said Augusta National chairman Fred Ridley.
""It's something ... I certainly hope never changes.""
One member of the media at this year's Masters was asked to remove his New York Mets baseball cap while eating breakfast in the Press Building's dining room.
Even 2018 Masters runner-up Rickie Fowler fell foul of the hat rule when, as a 22-year-old Masters rookie, he showed up to a 2011 news conference at Augusta National wearing his cap backwards until a club member asked him to turn it around.
When it comes to cell phones, they are prohibited on the course and violation of that rule will subject the ticket holder to removal from the grounds and the ticket purchaser to the permanent loss of credentials.
And gone are the random shouts of ""mashed potato"" directed at golfers the moment after hitting their tee shots during other PGA Tour events.
WELL-INFORMED PATRONS
At Augusta National, such behavior is mostly absent among a cast of spectators that competitors say are well-informed of the intricacies of the game, respective and reserved.
""If every week (on the PGA Tour) was like this week it would be awesome,"" world number 10 Xander Schauffele told Reuters.
Those lucky enough to get tickets to the Masters do so not as a ""fan"" but as a ""patron"", and while the difference in the two is mostly semantic it is one Augusta National is adamant about as it considers each attendee a valued customer.
So polite are the patrons that many arrive early to set up chairs at their preferred viewing areas and return hours later knowing their seat will still be there waiting for them.
""It's a good thing,"" former FedExCup champion Billy Horschel said when asked about what it is like knowing there will be little to no outside distraction while playing the Masters.
""Fans need to have fun but they need to understand that we are still trying to make a living for ourselves out here.""

SHANGHAI — Charles Leclerc steered clear on Thursday of suggestions that he had become a potential Ferrari 'number one' after a near flawless performance by the 21-year-old two weeks ago in Bahrain.
Facing the media ahead of Sunday’s Chinese Grand Prix, the Monegasque batted away questions with the same unflappable poise he had demonstrated under the floodlights while leading at Sakhir.
""I think things are going very quick in Formula One,"" said the Ferrari driver, who started on pole and set the fastest lap in Bahrain before being slowed by power unit problems and finishing third for his first podium.
""After the first race nobody sees me as a title contender and then after the second race everyone sees me as a title contender.
""I need to keep the focus on what I am doing in the car and trying to work as hard as possible and try to do the best job inside and outside of the car and then I am pretty sure the results will come.
Driving in only his second race for Ferrari, Leclerc was on course for an easy first win until engine trouble some 10 laps from the end allowed champion Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas to sweep through for a Mercedes one-two.
Leclerc’s performance struck a sharp contrast to four-time world champion Vettel’s, who was unable to match his team mate’s pace and whose race unravelled in a spin and a lost front wing.
""As I said we are only at the second race,” said a bemused-looking Leclerc, who made his F1 debut for Sauber (now Alfa Romeo) last year, when asked if he should be Ferrari's main contender.
""Anyway, this question is more to be asked to (team principal) Mattia (Binotto).
""I’m not making the decision on that,"" he said, before jokingly adding an ""unfortunately"" as Binotto looked on.
Vettel put his lacklustre performance down to not being comfortable with the car, an issue he hopes was ironed out in a test session after the Bahrain race, adding he was unfazed by being beaten by Leclerc.
""I have always shown respect when other people do well and so he did in Bahrain,"" said the 31-year-old.
""I know that I can do better and I know that we have lots of races to... prove that.”

ZURICH — Former France forward Florent Malouda found out on Twitter that his coaching work with FC Zurich had ended on Thursday.
The Swiss Super League club said in a statement that it had decided ""by mutual agreement"" to end its co-operation with Malouda who was hired two months ago to help train the club's forwards and young players.
""It turns out that the various (other) projects in which Florent Malouda remains involved are not compatible with the tasks planned by the FCZ,"" it said.
However, the former Chelsea and Olympique Lyonnais player quickly replied on Twitter: ""Really I didn't know that??.""
FC Zurich could not immediately be reached for comment.
Malouda, capped 80 times by France, ended his playing career last year in Luxemburg with FC Differdange.
In 2017, Malouda fell foul of FIFA rules over switching national teams when he played for French Guiana, where he was born, in the CONCACAF Gold Cup against Honduras.
French Guiana were fined and forfeited the match, which they had drawn 0-0, because FIFA rules bar players from representing two different national sides. French Guiana, an overseas department of France, argued the rule did not apply as they are not FIFA members.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Viktor Arvidsson scored the go-ahead goal at 3:33 of the third period, and the Nashville Predators won their second straight Central Division title by rallying from an 0-2 deficit to beat the Chicago Blackhawks 5-2 Saturday night.
With St. Louis beating Vancouver 3-2 earlier Saturday, the Predators needed two points against Chicago to win the Central or risk going from division champs to possibly third if Winnipeg finished off with a win at Arizona later. The Predators now are assured of home-ice advantage through at least the first two rounds of the playoffs.
The Predators struggled mightily when allowing the first goal all season, but they've have rallied from two-goal deficits in each of their past two games.
Arvidsson set the franchise record with his 34th goal of the season 22 seconds into the man advantage. His wrister from the left circle beat goalie Cam Ward glove-side and gave Nashville its first lead of the game, which Arvidsson celebrated by jumping in the air behind the net.
Filip Forsberg and Nick Bonino each had a goal and had an assist, and Dante Fabbro scored his first NHL goal for Nashville, which now has won five of six. Colton Sissons added an empty-netter with 2:09 left.
Pekka Rinne made 31 saves to finish 30-19-4, his eighth season with at least 30 wins.
Brendan Perlini and Drake Caggiula each scored for Chicago, which lost three of its final five.
Nashville hadn't won at home on a Saturday night since Dec. 15, and the Predators' last home win in regulation on a Saturday night was Dec. 1 in a 5-2 win over Chicago when they scored three goals on their first four shots.
This time it was the Blackhawks scoring on their first shot with Perlini's wrister from the left circle beating Rinne's glove at 2:58 of the first period. Artem Anisimov hit a post at 5:00, then Caggiula made it 2-0 Chicago with a wrister off an assist from Patrick Kane midway through the period.
Fabbro, who joined the Predators last week after wrapping up his junior year at Boston University, pulled the Predators to 1-0 with the first goal of his career at 9:07 of the second. Fabbro's wrister from the left circle went over Ward's glove. Then Ward made another big save, coming out to stop a partial breakaway by Arvidsson 90 seconds later.
Seconds after a power play ended, Forsberg tied it up with a slap shot for his 28th this season with 1:10 left in the second.
Nashville put it away with three goals in the third. Bonino's goal came inside the final minute with the celebration already well under way.
NOTES: Fabbro now is the 181st player to score a goal in Nashville history. ... Forsberg has 28 points (14 goals, 14 assists) in his last 36 games. ... Nashville improved to 5-8-1 when tied after two periods. ... Rinne tied Miikka Kiprusoff (623) for second-most all-time in games played by a goalie from Finland. ... Nashville is 12-25-5 when allowing the first goal and 9-19-2 when trailing after one period.

AUGUSTA, Ga. — Jon Rahm is back in contention at the Masters after shooting a 3-under 69 in the opening round. This time, he'll have a head start on most of the field entering the second round instead of fighting just to make the cut.
The 24-year-old Spaniard finished in fourth place last year at Augusta National, but had to fight from behind after shooting an opening round 75.
""Today, it's just kind of the start,"" Rahm said. ""Trying to get the tournament going. Hopefully you get yourself in position. It's a huge bonus to be in the lead — it's an amazing feeling.
""I'm just happy I shot under par in the first round of the tournament.""
Rahm was in the same group on Thursday as Tiger Woods, who also had a good opening round after shooting a 70. Playing with Woods always brings out the crowds, but Rahm didn't seem fazed by the big gallery, playing a bogey-free back nine that included birdies on No. 11 and No. 13.
The two-time PGA Tour winner is known for his temper, but kept his emotions in check on Thursday. He rarely compounded his mistakes. A good example was the 505-yard, par-4 No. 11: He hit his drive into the pine straw, but recovered with an approach that found the green and then finished with a 34-foot putt for birdie. A big grin followed.
""I think that the most important thing is I never lost patience,"" Rahm said. ""I was 1-over par on the par 5s going to the back nine where it's easy to get a little frustrated and I didn't. I kept my cool and I was able to make a great birdie on nine and get where I'm going.""
He also got some good fortune on No. 15, when a wayward drive that was flying left bounced off a tree and left a manageable second shot that led to par.
It was his fourth straight round at Augusta National shooting in the 60s.
Last year, Rahm shot 65 on Saturday and a 69 on Sunday, vaulting up the leaderboard to finish four shots behind winner Patrick Reed.
Rahm said that the most encouraging thing about Thursday's round was he managed to stay among the leaders even without being in top form. Now up to No. 8 in the world rankings, playing well at Augusta is beginning to become a habit.
""I didn't have my best, I was a little shaky with the driver, I was able to keep it in the fairway for the better part today,"" Rahm said. ""My iron play also didn't feel the best, but again I was able to manage it and hit some quality shots out there.""

SYDNEY — Rugby Australia said on Thursday it would terminate the contract of Israel Folau, the country's best-known and best-paid player, if he cannot offer a good reason for a social media post that said gay people would go to ""hell"" if they did not ""repent"".
The 30-year-old fullback, a fundamentalist Christian, posted similar comments last year but escaped sanction and signed a new deal with RA through 2022 in February.
That multi-million dollar contract looks certain to be torn up unless Folau can convince RA and the New South Wales Waratahs that there are ""compelling mitigating factors"" for sharing the post.
A statement from RA Chief Executive Raelene Castle and her Waratahs equivalent Andrew Hore said they had made repeated attempts to contact Folau since he posted the comments on Wednesday.
""Whilst Israel is entitled to his religious beliefs, the way in which he has expressed these beliefs is inconsistent with the values of the sport,"" the statement added.
""Israel has failed to understand that the expectation of him as a Rugby Australia and NSW Waratahs employee is that he cannot share material on social media that condemns, vilifies or discriminates against people on the basis of their sexuality.
""As a code we have made it clear to Israel formally and repeatedly that any social media posts or commentary that is in any way disrespectful to people because of their sexuality will result in disciplinary action.
""In the absence of compelling mitigating factors, it is our intention to terminate his contract.""
The unprecedented move will throw into disarray Australia coach Michael Cheika's plans for the Rugby World Cup in Japan later this year.
Folau has been all but ever-present in the Wallabies number 15 shirt since switching to rugby union from Australian Rules in 2013 and scoring two tries on his test debut against the British and Irish Lions.
He has scored 35 more tries in 72 tests since and helped Australia to the final of the 2015 World Cup in England, where they were beaten by New Zealand.
An elusive and dangerous runner, Folau helped the Waratahs to the Super Rugby title in 2014 and only last weekend became the highest career try-scorer in the competition when he crossed for his 60th five-pointer.
Folau has had previous lucrative offers to play in Europe and Japan but his stated desire to remain in Australia makes his most likely destination a move back to rugby league, a code in which he represented Australia at the start of his career.
'NO INTENTIONAL HURT'
Raised as a Mormon, Folau moved to a pentecostal church in 2011 and has made no secret of his religious beliefs since.
He was a critic of the proposal to make same-sex marriage legal in Australia before it was passed in 2017 and last year took to Instagram with his first post about gay people being destined for hell.
Castle said then that RA ""accepted"" his position that he had just been expressing his beliefs and had not intended to ""upset people intentionally or bring hurt to the game"".
Wednesday's post, which took the form of a meme based on verses from the bible, said gay people and others he perceived to be ""living in sin"", including ""drunks"", ""idolaters"" and ""atheists"", would be condemned to hell.
The post drew widespread condemnation from around the world with New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern among those criticizing Folau for the way he was using 'his platform'.
Japan rugby captain Michael Leitch posted a video in Instagram in which he said Folau's comments were ""wrong on so many levels"" and could be ""a real stab in the heart"" for people struggling with their mental health.
The RA and Waratahs statement on Thursday said they wanted rugby to be a sport that unites and welcomes people regardless of their ""race, gender, religion or sexuality"".
""No language that isolates, divides or insults people based on any of those factors can be tolerated,"" it said.
Pride in Sport, which works to make Australian sport inclusive for LGBT people, later welcomed the decisive action taken by Castle and Hore.
""This unprecedented course of action sends a strong message of what will and will not be tolerated in rugby – and they've made it clear that homophobia and transphobia has no place in the sport,"" said Andrew Purchas, founder of the Sydney Convicts, Australia's first and most successful gay rugby club.

PHOENIX — Carson Kelly drilled a single into the left field corner, scoring Nick Ahmed with two outs in the ninth inning to lift the Arizona Diamondbacks over the struggling Boston Red Sox 5-4 Saturday night.
Boston has dropped three straight and fell to 2-8 overall, a lousy start to their World Series championship defense.
Colten Brewer (0-1) allowed consecutive singles to Eduardo Escobar, Ahmed and Kelly in the ninth. Right fielder Mookie Betts threw out Escobar at home on Ahmed's hit, but Kelly's rip to left allowed Ahmed to score easily.
Kelly had two hits and three RBIs. The walkoff knock was the first of his career.
Greg Holland (1-0) pitched a scoreless top of the ninth.
The Diamondbacks led 4-3 after two innings, but neither team scored until the seventh. Jackie Bradley Jr. drew a leadoff walk against Yoshihisa Hirano and took third on J.D. Martinez's pinch-hit single. Andrew Benintendi drew a walk, and Betts drove in the tying run with a sacrifice fly.
The Red Sox loaded the bases against one of Arizona's top relievers, Archie Bradley, but Bradley got Xander Bogaerts to ground into an inning-ending fielder's choice.
Boston's David Price started and worked six innings, allowing four runs and seven hits with four strikeouts.
Luke Weaver improved from his last start, allowing three runs, five hits and two walks with four strikeouts over five innings. Weaver gave up four earned runs in 4 1/3 innings against the Los Angeles Dodgers on March 30.
The Red Sox plated the game's first three runs in the top of the second. Bogaerts led off with a walk and took third with heads-up baserunning on a shallow single to center by Rafael Devers. Eduardo Nunez's groundout scored Bogaerts, and one out later, Devers came home on Price's single past first base. That was Price's first career RBI and his fourth hit in 50 at-bats.
Benintendi hit a ground-rule double to center field, scoring Christian Vazquez and making it 3-0.
The Diamondbacks took the lead in the next half-inning. Ahmed singled in David Peralta from third base with one out, and Kelly followed with a two-run double. Adam Jones singled in Kelly, who crossed home before a close play on Jones at second base. Jones was first called safe at second, but the Red Sox challenged and the play was reviewed and overturned.
ROOF IT
The retractable roof at Chase Field opened with no problems as the top of the fourth inning got underway. The roof malfunctioned Friday during the Diamondbacks' home opener.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Red Sox: IF-OF Brock Holt and LHP Brian Johnson were placed on the 10-day injured list Saturday. Holt has a scratched cornea in his right eye, and Johnson has left elbow inflammation. ... Utility player Tzu-Wei Lin and RHP Marcus Walden were called up from Triple-A Pawtucket. Lin grounded out as a pinch-hitter in the ninth.
Diamondbacks: LHP T.J. McFarland (shoulder) threw 20 pitches in a simulated game Saturday and manager Torey Lovullo was encouraged. ... RHP Taijuan Walker is set for a 40-pitch bullpen as he comes back from elbow surgery a little less than a year ago.
UP NEXT
RHP Merrill Kelly (1-0) is set for his second start of the season Sunday against Boston. He allowed three runs in six innings at San Diego in his first start to earn the win. The Red Sox had yet to name Sunday's starting pitcher as of Saturday night.

DENVER — Alex Verdugo homered and added an RBI triple as the Los Angeles Dodgers kept up their early power surge Saturday night in a 7-2 win over the Colorado Rockies.
The Dodgers have gone deep in all nine games this season, piling up 22 home runs. Los Angeles had four through nine games last year when the team set a franchise record with 235.
Hot-hitting Cody Bellinger delivered a double and an RBI triple to help the Dodgers win their seventh straight over Colorado dating to last season. Verdugo tripled home a run in the ninth.
Walker Buehler (1-0) allowed one run over five solid innings as he bounced back from a rough opening outing. He was on a pitch count after a limited spring training.
Kenley Jansen got four outs to earn his fourth save. It was his first appearance in the Mile High City since the All-Star reliever had surgery in the offseason to address an irregular heartbeat that surfaced again while in Denver for a series last August. He didn't travel with the team back to Colorado in September as a precaution.
Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said Friday he wouldn't hesitate to use his closer.
It was another rough outing for Jon Gray (0-2), who allowed five runs in six innings. Gray has served up a homer in 14 straight appearances, a Rockies record.
Gray was in trouble in the first three innings, but escaped each time thanks to three double plays. In the fourth, Los Angeles capitalized as A.J. Pollock had an RBI single and Max Muncy brought in another run with a sacrifice fly.
David Dahl homered for a second consecutive day, launching a fastball from Buehler into the second deck in right field. Dahl also had a run-scoring single in the eighth.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Dodgers: LHP Rich Hill (strained left knee) threw a 20-pitch bullpen. ""Felt his knee injury a bit, but it didn't limit him,"" Roberts said. ... LHP Clayton Kershaw (shoulder inflammation) will soon make a second rehab start. Roberts said Kershaw will decide if it's with Triple-A Oklahoma City or Double-A Tulsa.
Rockies: RHP Antonio Senzatela (infected blister on right heel) threw five innings for Triple-A Albuquerque. ... LHP Chris Rusin (back) threw a bullpen.
ALL IN THE FAMILY
The Rockies recalled infielder Josh Fuentes from Triple-A Albuquerque after placing first baseman Ryan McMahon on the injured list with a sprained elbow. Fuentes is the cousin of third baseman Nolan Arenado and made his major league debut as a pinch hitter in the eighth with a sharp single.
HARDWARE
Trevor Story, Arenado and Márquez were presented with their Silver Slugger Awards before the game. Arenado also picked up his Gold Glove.
""Worked really hard for those accolades,"" Arenado said. ""I kind of want them.""
UP NEXT
Dodgers LHP Julio Urias (0-0) has an 8.18 ERA in three career games against the Rockies heading into his start Sunday. Rockies RHP Chad Bettis (0-1, 9.53 ERA) tries to rebound from his last start at Tampa Bay in which he allowed six runs over 5 2/3 innings.

SYDNEY — Rugby Australia said on Thursday it would terminate the contract of Israel Folau, the country's best-known and best-paid player, if he cannot offer a good reason for a social media post that said gay people would go to ""hell"" if they did not ""repent"".
The 30-year-old fullback, a fundamentalist Christian, posted similar comments last year but escaped sanction and signed a new deal with RA through 2022 in February.
That multi-million dollar contract looks certain to be torn up unless Folau can convince RA and the New South Wales Waratahs that there are ""compelling mitigating factors"" for sharing the post.
A statement from RA Chief Executive Raelene Castle and her Waratahs equivalent Andrew Hore said they had made repeated attempts to contact Folau since he posted the comments on Wednesday.
""Whilst Israel is entitled to his religious beliefs, the way in which he has expressed these beliefs is inconsistent with the values of the sport,"" the statement added.
""Israel has failed to understand that the expectation of him as a Rugby Australia and NSW Waratahs employee is that he cannot share material on social media that condemns, vilifies or discriminates against people on the basis of their sexuality.
""As a code we have made it clear to Israel formally and repeatedly that any social media posts or commentary that is in any way disrespectful to people because of their sexuality will result in disciplinary action.
""In the absence of compelling mitigating factors, it is our intention to terminate his contract.""
The unprecedented move will throw into disarray Australia coach Michael Cheika's plans for the Rugby World Cup in Japan later this year.
Folau has been all but ever-present in the Wallabies number 15 shirt since switching to rugby union from Australian Rules in 2013 and scoring two tries on his test debut against the British and Irish Lions.
He has scored 35 more tries in 72 tests since and helped Australia to the final of the 2015 World Cup in England, where they were beaten by New Zealand.
An elusive and dangerous runner, Folau helped the Waratahs to the Super Rugby title in 2014 and only last weekend became the highest career try-scorer in the competition when he crossed for his 60th five-pointer.
Folau has had previous lucrative offers to play in Europe and Japan but his stated desire to remain in Australia makes his most likely destination a move back to rugby league, a code in which he represented Australia at the start of his career.
'NO INTENTIONAL HURT'
Raised as a Mormon, Folau moved to a pentecostal church in 2011 and has made no secret of his religious beliefs since.
He was a critic of the proposal to make same-sex marriage legal in Australia before it was passed in 2017 and last year took to Instagram with his first post about gay people being destined for hell.
Castle said then that RA ""accepted"" his position that he had just been expressing his beliefs and had not intended to ""upset people intentionally or bring hurt to the game"".
Wednesday's post, which took the form of a meme based on verses from the bible, said gay people and others he perceived to be ""living in sin"", including ""drunks"", ""idolaters"" and ""atheists"", would be condemned to hell.
The post drew widespread condemnation from around the world with New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern among those criticizing Folau for the way he was using 'his platform'.
Japan rugby captain Michael Leitch posted a video in Instagram in which he said Folau's comments were ""wrong on so many levels"" and could be ""a real stab in the heart"" for people struggling with their mental health.
The RA and Waratahs statement on Thursday said they wanted rugby to be a sport that unites and welcomes people regardless of their ""race, gender, religion or sexuality"".
""No language that isolates, divides or insults people based on any of those factors can be tolerated,"" it said.
Pride in Sport, which works to make Australian sport inclusive for LGBT people, later welcomed the decisive action taken by Castle and Hore.
""This unprecedented course of action sends a strong message of what will and will not be tolerated in rugby – and they've made it clear that homophobia and transphobia has no place in the sport,"" said Andrew Purchas, founder of the Sydney Convicts, Australia's first and most successful gay rugby club.

AUGUSTA Ga. (Reuters) - Rory McIlroy's desire to complete his collection of golf's four majors with a win at this week's Masters has led the Northern Irishman to try a fresh approach, one that focuses on meditation and juggling.
McIlroy enters the year's first major as the hottest player on the planet and he credits his solid start to 2019 with a new attitude that is all about perspective, persistence and poise, or what he refers to as the three P's.
The new formula for McIlroy, who will play the opening two rounds this week with American Rickie Fowler and Australia's Cameron Smith, centres around meditation, juggling and mind training.
""Look, I'm not going to go and live with the monks for a couple months in Nepal, but just to be able to get your mind in the right place and be able to focus and to centre yourself,"" McIlroy told a news conference at Augusta National on Tuesday.
""It's 10 minutes a day. It's not as if I'm being consumed by it. But definitely something that has helped from time to time. Especially in situations where you need your mind to be right.""
McIlroy has five consecutive top-10 finishes at the Masters yet his defining moment at Augusta National remains his final-round collapse in 2011 when he failed to close out the win despite entering the day with a four-shot lead.
But McIlroy, who has since gone on to win four times at golf's three other majors, has visions of becoming just the sixth person to complete the career grand slam and hopes his new approach will prove fruitful.
The 29-year-old Northern Irishman has a top-six finish in each of the six stroke play events he has played this year, including a triumph at the Players Championship where he meditated for 20 minutes ahead of the final round.
Early indications, therefore, are that McIlroy may be on the right path with his meditation and juggling.
""They mightn't be the right things for other people, but I think I've found a formula that works for me, and I'm ‑‑ you know, I'm going to persist with it and I'm going to stick to it,"" said McIlroy.
""It's helped me play some of the best golf of my career so far this year, and you know, hopefully that will continue.""
When it comes to juggling, McIlroy described himself as a ""rookie"" who can only handle three balls at once.
""You know, maybe what resonates with me is isn't going to resonate with someone else, but I found what I feel is the best path forward for me and I've committed to it,"" McIlroy said.
McIlroy, who had another close call last year when he began the final round three shots behind eventual winner Patrick Reed, said the pressure he puts on himself at Augusta National compared to his previous appearances has changed.
""I would dearly love to win this tournament one day. If it doesn't happen this week, that's totally fine, I'll come back next year and have another crack at it,"" said McIlroy.
""But I'm happy with where everything is, body, mind, game.""

Ohio State quarterback Dwayne Haskins' name was notably absent when the league listed the 23 players who will attend the NFL Draft in Nashville later this month.
Haskins has not commented on his decision to forego the festivities, but the revelation follows speculation this week that his draft stock is slipping.
Peter King wrote in Monday's ""Football Morning in America"" column that the former Buckeyes star ""could plummet"" and might be the fourth quarterback off the board after Heisman Trophy winner Kyler Murray of Oklahoma, Missouri's Drew Lock and Duke's Daniel Jones.
Murray, Lock and Jones will be in attendance when the draft kicks off on April 25. So will Ohio State pass rusher Nick Bosa, a potential No. 1 overall pick along with Murray.
Haskins completed 70 percent of his passes for 4,831 yards with 50 touchdowns and eight interceptions in 14 starts last season.
It's not uncommon for top players to skip the green room and attend draft parties at home with friends and family. The last two No. 1 overall selections -- Baker Mayfield in 2018 and Myles Garrett in 2017 -- opted not to attend the draft.

Former NFL and Notre Dame running back Cierre Wood was scheduled to appear in court Thursday in Las Vegas after being charged with first-degree murder in the death of a 5-year-old girl, according to court records.
The alleged victim was the daughter of Wood's girlfriend, identified by local media as 26-year-old Amy Taylor, who also was taken into custody Tuesday night at Summerlin Hospital.
The Clark County Coroner's Office confirmed 5-year-old La'Ravah Davis died at the hospital that night, KVVU-TV in Las Vegas reported.
Wood, 28, played in seven games in the NFL from 2013-15, carrying the ball five times for 12 yards. He was mostly on the practice squads in Houston, Buffalo, New England and Seattle. He also had three stops in the Canadian Football League after the NFL.
At Notre Dame, where he played from 2010-12, he rushed for 16 touchdowns and 2,447 yards in his career. He also had 52 receptions for 384 yards and two scores.

Texas Longhorns freshman Jaxson Hayes has declared for the NBA draft and will hire an agent, the school announced Thursday.
""I have always dreamed about playing in the NBA. Now that I have the chance to realize that dream, I would like to pursue that opportunity,"" Hayes said in a statement.
The 6-foot-11 forward averaged 10 points and 5.0 rebounds in his only season with the Longhorns. He started 21 of 32 games and shot 72.8 percent from the floor.
The Big 12 Freshman of the Year is a potential lottery pick, according to several draft outlets. ESPN ranks him as the No. 9 prospect.
--LSU freshman guard Javonte Smart announced on social media that he will enter the draft, joining teammates Naz Reid, Skylar Mays and Tremont Waters.
Smart averaged 11.1 points, 3.3 rebounds and 2.4 assists in his lone year in Baton Rouge.
LSU sat Smart for the regular-season finale following the suspension of coach Will Wade over allegations he was linked to the NCAA's pay-for-play scandal. It has been speculated that Wade was part of a scheme to pay to gain Smart's commitment to LSU.

AUGUSTA, Ga. — Six-times Masters champion Jack Nicklaus once said he did not carry a mobile phone because people never called to offer him something, but only if they wanted something.
Times have changed since he made those remarks some two decades ago and these days Nicklaus is as wedded to his smartphone as billions of other people around the world.
The PGA Tour relented on its phone ban in 2011, asking spectators to put the devices on silent mode so as not to distract players. With occasional exceptions, the policy has worked smoothly.
But the Masters still bans such devices at Augusta National, and players have said that they find it a refreshing change.
Nicklaus, however, thinks the writing is on the wall, and that the tournament will end up following the PGA Tour's lead.
""I think they probably will change that shortly,"" Nicklaus, an Augusta National member, said on Thursday after hitting the ceremonial first tee shot to kick off the 83rd Masters.
""I think you should ask the PGA Tour if the cell phone has become a problem, or has it become something that's so much of everyday life that people have learned how to respect it and use it properly.
""I understand exactly what's going on here and I respect that but I think times have changed ... but not my call.""
His comments came less than 24 hours after Masters chairman Fred Ridley reiterated the club's strict policy on the matter.
""I think our patrons appreciate our cell phone policy,"" said Ridley.
""I know that we have now become an outlier, if not the only outlier in golf.
""I don't believe that's a policy that anyone should expect is going to change in the near future, if ever.
""I can’t speak for future chairmen, but speaking for myself, I think we got that right.""
Given that Ridley is a fit and healthy 66-year-old, his tenure as chairman could last quite a while.
But Nicklaus thinks the old problem of players being put off when phones made a clicking sound taking pictures no longer exists.
""Doesn't make a noise anymore,"" he said.
""I don't think I've ever had a distraction from the gallery that ever affected what happened in the tournament.""

LIVERPOOL, England — Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp hailed the performance of his skipper Jordan Henderson in Tuesday's 2-0 Champions League win over Porto, with the England midfielder delivering another impressive display in a more advanced role.
Henderson recently said he had been badgering Klopp to allow him more freedom to break into the final third and, after scoring as a second-half substitute at Southampton on Friday, he started and delivered a killer pass for Liverpool's second goal.
""Hendo is a brilliant player. He obviously likes the position. We've not used him there for 3.5 years -- sorry about that!"" grinned Klopp.
""I'm glad he can show it. There were a lot of good individual performances,"" he said.
Henderson has often played in a defensive midfield role but with Brazilian Fabinho taking care of that responsibility, he is now able to push into advanced areas.
The England midfielder certainly provided some assistance to the front three of Sadio Mane, Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino, with his harrying and pressing helping maintain pressure on the Porto defence.
Yet his beautiful, defence-splitting pass to Trent Alexander-Arnold, which set up Firmino's goal to make it 2-0, showed he is much more than just a midfield workhorse.
Klopp was also pleased with the performance of midfielder Naby Keita, who he said had delivered his most complete display for the club since his close-season move from RB Leipzig.
""Naby was really, really good. He got better minute by minute last game and he continued that,"" added the Liverpool boss.
""We are happy, it is the first leg and it will be an intense second game. We scored two goals and controlled the ball most of the time,"" he said.
""We lost a little bit of direction in the second half, but there's nothing to criticise, 2-0 is a very, very good result.
""We knew we had to play the second game and we cannot decide the tie tonight, so now we have to go there and fight again.""

LONDON — Son Heung-min once again proved there is more to Tottenham Hotspur than Harry Kane as the South Korean's late goal secured a 1-0 home win over Manchester City in an absorbing Champions League quarter-final first leg on Tuesday.
With Spurs talisman Kane having hobbled off injured and favourites City beginning to turn the screw, Son sent the home fans inside the London club's majestic new stadium into delirium as he fired past Ederson in the 78th minute.
It gave Tottenham a slender but precious advantage to take to City's Etihad Stadium next week when they will attempt to reach the Champions League semi-finals for the first time.
Quadruple-chasing City were not at their best as Spurs chased and harried Pep Guardiola's side for 90 minutes and they will rue Sergio Aguero's first-half penalty miss.
The Argentine was handed the chance to put City ahead when full back Danny Rose was controversially adjudged by VAR to have used his arm to block a shot, but his 13th minute spot kick was brilliantly saved by Hugo Lloris.
The French keeper's heroics produced a deafening roar not heard along the Tottenham High Road since Spurs moved out of their old stadium two years ago, but it was nothing compared to the sound that greeted Son's 78th minute winner.
""As a team we never give up, we fight until 90 minutes. I think we deserved to win, we were more clinical than them,"" said Son, who last week scored the first Premier League goal in the 62,000-seat arena, and now owns the first European strike there.
""I like this stadium, it is amazing to play here, I am grateful for the opportunity to play at this stadium,"" he added.
SUPERB STOP
Tottenham fans in the 17,500 capacity South Stand displayed placards before kickoff spelling out the club's motto 'To Dare is To Do' -- and their team obliged, going toe-to-toe with a side who had won 21 of their last 23 games in all competitions.
Dele Alli volleyed Moussa Sissoko's cross over early on but Tottenham were then stopped in their tracks.
Raheem Sterling cut in and fired goalwards and Rose, diving to block, was harshly penalised for handball, courtesy of VAR, despite no City players even appealing for a penalty.
France international Lloris, who has come in for criticism this season, guessed right and made a superb stop.
Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino said on the eve of the game that his side would need to match the intensity of a City outfit oozing quality, both on the pitch and on a bench containing Kevin de Bruyne, Gabriel Jesus and Leroy Sane.
Tottenham worked hard to deny City time, with the once maligned Sissoko immense, but after England forward Kane hobbled off just before the hour mark with a worrying-looking ankle injury after a clash with City's surprise inclusion at left back Fabian Delph, the hosts appeared to be flagging.
City, for whom Sterling was a constant menace, were hunting an away goal but then Son, who has a knack of scoring for the side Guardiola once described as the ""Harry Kane team"" when their talisman has been sidelined, struck the decisive blow.
At first the Korean's control from Christian Eriksen's measured pass was sloppy, but Son retrieved the ball, then cut in from the byline and lashed a shot past Ederson.
Guardiola sent on De Bruyne and Sane in the 89th minute, but Tottenham survived six minutes of stoppage time to leave City with a stiff task next week.
""Sometimes 1-0 is better than 0-0, as you know exactly what you have to do,"" Guardiola, whose side lost to Liverpool in last season's quarter-finals after a 3-0 first-leg defeat, said.
""We have to go out to score goals.""

MEMPHIS, Tenn. — The Memphis Grizzlies started the offseason Thursday with plenty of questions to answer, then controlling owner Robert Pera added to the to-do list by firing coach J.B. Bickerstaff as part of a front-office shake-up that demoted general manager Chris Wallace to scout.
The Grizzlies announced the moves after both Bickerstaff and Wallace spoke to reporters following a second straight season outside the playoffs. After a 12-5 start, Memphis plummeted and finished 33-49, tied with New Orleans and Dallas.
Wallace had said earlier that Bickerstaff would be returning after doing a ""terrific job."" But Pera didn't agree and restructured the front office a few hours later.
""In order to put our team on the path to sustainable success, it was necessary to change our approach to basketball operations,"" Pera said in a statement. ""I look forward to a re-energized front office and fresh approach to Memphis Grizzlies basketball under new leadership, while retaining the identity and values that have distinguished our team.""
Bickerstaff was named interim coach in November 2017 after the Grizzlies fired David Fizdale . He was given the job without the interim title last May. Now Memphis is looking for a fourth head coach since choosing not to renew Lionel Hollins' contract after he led the Grizzlies to their lone Western Conference final appearance in 2013.
The Grizzlies also announced that Jason Wexler will be president of the Grizzlies overseeing both basketball and business operations, and Zachary Z. Kleiman replaces John Hollinger as executive vice president of basketball operations with Hollinger moving to an advisory role. The Grizzlies are keeping former player Tayshaun Prince as a special adviser.
""No words,"" Grizzlies veteran point guard Mike Conley wrote on Twitter.
Memphis began this season with Wallace predicting the Grizzlies would be a playoff team.
The Grizzlies wound up trading away center Marc Gasol at the trade deadline. With other trades and injuries that left nine rotation players benched with injuries for Wednesday night's season finale in a 132-117 win over Golden State, Memphis tied its own NBA record for most players used in one season — set last season — again at 28.
Memphis also set the NBA mark with 20 different leading scorers, topping the old record of 16 set by the Knicks in 2014-15.
While Memphis kept Conley after a frenzy of speculation about his future before the trade deadline, that chatter is about to start again. And Conley, 31, sounds ready to consider his best interest about what happens next with Memphis in full-blown rebuilding mode.
""I honestly don't think that would be the ideal situation,"" Conley said. ""Ideally, I don't think anybody in my situation would want to go through that again, (since) I don't know how many years I have left.""
Conley helped his potential value by averaging 24 points and 6.5 assists over his final 16 games. Conley still has two seasons left on the max deal he signed in July 2016,.
""I'm pretty much getting ready for it, getting ready for that storm ...,"" Conley said of the coming speculation. ""In the last few weeks, it's become more and more like knocking on the door. It's right around the corner. This stuff is going to fire up again. Rumors, all that stuff is going to pop up.""
Wallace oversaw the signing of Chandler Parsons to a four-year, $94 million deal that has seen the forward play 95 games combined over the first three seasons.
The Grizzlies spent much of the season trying to finish outside the top eight spots in the draft to finally pay off a 2015 midseason trade for Jeff Green that still requires a first-round pick to be sent to Boston. The selection is protected if Memphis finished anywhere from No. 1 to 8 in the draft, and the Grizzlies want to fulfill that obligation this June.
Memphis wound up in a three-way tie with Dallas and New Orleans for the 7-9 position. Whether the Grizzlies land in the ninth position or with the selection protected won't be known until after the May 14 draft lottery.
The next Grizzlies coach will have Jaren Jackson Jr. who showed flashes as the fourth overall draft pick last summer before a deep thigh bruise sidelined him after 58 games. Dillon Brooks also was limited to 18 games by injuries, and Kyle Anderson, signed to a four-year deal last summer, played only 43 games and will have surgery next week on his right shoulder.
Jonas Valanciunas, acquired in the February trade for Gasol, has a $17.6 million player option next season.

SHANGHAI — What's Kimi Raikkonen's secret to Formula One longevity?
He started in F1 in 2001, won the season championship in 2007 and has driven for the sport's biggest names in Ferrari and McLaren. His name is spread all around the F1 record books.
He'll be 40 before this season ends, and he's still at it. This season he's with Alfa Romeo, which is the old Sauber team renamed — the same Sauber he started with almost two decades ago.
""I don't have any special thing that I try to motivate myself,"" he said Thursday, looking ahead to Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix. ""It's become more of a hobby for me, maybe more than anything else. And probably that's why it's fun again.""
Ferrari dropped him after last season, going instead with 21-year-old Charles Leclerc of Monaco. Raikkonen has scored points in the first two races, finishing eighth in Australia and seventh in Bahrain. That's about as good as possible behind F1's three dominant teams — Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull.
""I always try to do the best that I can,"" he said. ""Some days it goes a bit better than others. But that's how it goes. (Motivation) has never really been an issue.""
Raikkonen said he ""didn't really have any goals"" going into this season, and he said he'll know it's time to retire when his performance is ""not what I expect from myself.""
F1 is billing the Chinese Grand Prix as its 1,000th race. This distinction requires some creative math.
Officials list the first race as the British Grand Prix on May 13, 1950, at Silverstone, the former World War II airfield in south England. The winner was Guiseppe Farina, driving for Alfa Romeo.
One counting problem is the inclusion of the Indianapolis 500 on the F1 calendar between 1950 and 1960, though few F1 drivers ever competed there — and Indy ran by its own set of rules.
Raikkonen has been around so long that Mexican driver Sergio Perez, 29, joked that he recalled getting interested in the sport by watching ""Kimi back then at a very young age.""
Raikkonen has won 21 times in F1 and might have won more had he not been away two seasons driving rally cars.
The 1,000 mark prompted Haas driver Romain Grosjean to speculate about what car racing might look like 50 years from now — perhaps another 1,000 races down the road.
""I've got no idea what the cars are going to be like in 40 or 50 years,"" he said. ""The only think I'll say: I hope there is still going to be a driver driving the car because that's where the emotions go. If it's just robots, it's not going to be much fun.""

TOKYO — Japan's Olympic minister resigned Wednesday after making remarks deemed offensive to the people affected by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, a gaffe that had questioned his credentials.
Yoshitaka Sakurada said he submitted his resignation to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. He said he made comments that hurt the feelings those in the disaster-hit areas, and just retracting them would not be enough.
Sakurada, at a party earlier Wednesday for Hinako Takahashi — a ruling lawmaker from Iwate, one of the prefectures severely hit by the disaster — said Takahashi is more important than reconstruction.
Sakurada was in charge of the 2020 Games, whose main theme is to promote reconstruction of the disaster-struck region.
Abe was quick in his damage control. Soon after accepting Sakurada's resignation, he apologized for the minister's remark to the people in the disaster-hit region, reassuring them that his government has an unshakable policy to do the utmost for reconstruction while staying close to the feelings of the people affected.
""As prime minister, I offer an apology to everyone in the disaster-hit areas,"" Abe said. ""I have a responsibility for having appointed him.""
Former Olympic minister Shunichi Suzuki is expected to return to the post to replace Sakrada, Japanese media reports said.
Sakurada joined Abe's Cabinet as part of its reshuffle last year, quickly making a reputation as a gaffe-prone minister.
Sakurada, who also doubled as cybersecurity strategy chief, said in November that he does not use a computer. In February, he was forced to apologize after expressing disappointment over swimming gold medal hopeful Rikako Ikee's disclosure of her leukemia diagnosis. Sakurada was also scolded for being late and holding up a parliamentary session.
""Minister Sakurada's resignation is only natural. It was an unbelievable comment that hurt the feelings of the people in the region and others working hard for the reconstruction,"" said Yukio Edano, leader of a main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan.
Edano also criticized Abe for repeatedly defending Sakurada despite his repeated problems since his appointment.
Sakurada's resignation is also an embarrassment for Abe, who saw another Cabinet member step down over a questionable remark. Deputy minister of land, infrastructure, transport and tourism minister Ichiro Tsukada quit last week after suggesting he acted for the interests of Abe and Finance Minister Taro Aso over a road project related to their constituencies, prompting opposition lawmakers to seek explanation though he denied any preferential treatment.

Luke Kennard scored 27 points off the bench and the postseason-bound Detroit Pistons closed out their regular season finale by walloping the host New York Knicks 115-89 on Wednesday.
The Pistons (41-41) qualified for the Eastern Conference playoffs for just the second time since the 2009-10 season. They were swept by Cleveland in the opening round of the 2015-16 playoffs.
Detroit will be the No. 8 seed and face top-seeded Milwaukee in the first round.
Kennard's point total was one shy of his career high. Reggie Jackson had 21 points and Andre Drummond supplied 20 points and 18 rebounds for Detroit. Wayne Ellington tossed in 12 points, all on 3-point makes.
Heat 113, Nets 94
Dwyane Wade ended his storied career with a triple-double of 25 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists as visiting Miami was dealt a loss to Brooklyn, which clinched sixth place in the Eastern Conference.
The Nets honored Wade with a video tribute in pregame introductions by highlighting some of his notable shots against them over the course of a 16-year career while the text on the screen read ""Thanks for the Memories.""
With longtime friends LeBron James, Chris Paul and Carmelo Anthony sitting courtside, Wade recorded his fifth career triple-double in his 1,054th regular-season game since entering the league as the fifth overall pick out of Marquette in 2003.
Spurs 105, Mavericks 94
LaMarcus Aldridge poured in 34 points and totaled 16 rebounds to help propel San Antonio to a resounding win over visiting Dallas in the regular-season finale for both teams.
It was also the final game in the 21-year career of Dallas forward Dirk Nowitzki, who led Dallas with 20 points and pulled down 10 rebounds in 31 minutes of play before leaving the court for the final time with 47 seconds remaining.
The win was San Antonio's third straight and -- combined with Oklahoma City's win over Milwaukee -- earned the Spurs the seventh seed in the NBA playoffs, where they will face the Denver Nuggets. Dallas, playing the second game of an emotional home-road back-to-back, had a two-game winning streak snapped and they will miss the postseason for the third straight season.
Trail Blazers 136, Kings 131
Rookie Anfernee Simons scored a season-high 37 points to lift Portland to a come-from-behind victory over visiting Sacramento.
Skal Labissiere added 29 points and 15 rebounds for the Trail Blazers, who trailed by as many as 28 points in the first half.
Jake Layman, Meyers Leonard and Gary Trent Jr. scored 19 points apiece for Portland (53-29), which gained the No. 3 seed in the Western Conference and will face No. 6 Oklahoma City (49-33) in the first round of the playoffs.
Nuggets 99, Timberwolves 95
Jamal Murray hit a go-ahead 3-pointer with 31.5 seconds left, and host Denver scored the final 15 points of the game to beat Minnesota to earn the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference.
Nikola Jokic finished with 29 points and 14 rebounds and Murray scored 17 for Denver. The Nuggets (54-28) will play the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the playoffs.
Andrew Wiggins scored 25 points, Gorgui Dieng had 18 points and 11 rebounds and Cameron Reynolds added 19 points off the bench for the short-handed Timberwolves (36-46).
Clippers 143, Jazz 137 (OT)
With their respective playoff spots locked, Los Angeles and Utah ended their regular seasons in overtime, where the Clippers won to end a three-game losing streak.
Montrezl Harrell scored 24 points to lead the Clippers. Ivica Zubac added 22 points and 11 rebounds and Lou Williams scored 15 off the bench.
Utah rookie Grayson Allen scored a career-high 40 points and Georges Niang scored a career-best 24 off the bench.
Thunder 127, Bucks 116
Dennis Schroder scored 32 points to help Oklahoma City earn the No. 6 seed in the Western Conference with a win at Milwaukee.
The Bucks, who had already sealed the top seed in the Eastern Conference coming into the game, sat three starters -- Giannis Antetokounmpo, Eric Bledsoe and Brook Lopez -- to rest them for the playoffs.
Milwaukee (60-22) will start the playoffs against the eighth-seeded Detroit Pistons (41-41). The Thunder (49-33) will open the playoffs against the third-seeded Portland Trail Blazers (53-29).
Pacers 135, Hawks 134
Edmond Sumner made three free throws with 0.3 seconds remaining to lift Indiana to a road win over Atlanta in the final regular-season game for both teams.
Atlanta finished the season with a 29-53 record while Indiana (48-34) heads into the playoffs winners of only four of its last 13 games.
The fifth-place Pacers will oppose the fourth-place Boston Celtics (49-33) in the first round of the Eastern Conference postseason.
Magic 122, Hornets 114
Terrence Ross came off the bench to score a season-high 35 points, and playoff-bound Orlando ended Charlotte's season.
Ross scored 19 of his points in the first half, when the Magic led by as many as 13. He finished 12 of 19 from the field and 6 of 10 from 3-point range. Ross' performance overshadowed a 43-point explosion by Charlotte's Kemba Walker in the defeat.
The Magic (42-40) remained the No. 7 seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs with the victory, and will face second-seeded Toronto in the first round of the playoffs.
Grizzlies 132, Warriors 117
Memphis dizzied visiting Golden State in the regular-season finale for both teams, parlaying a remarkable 86-point first half into a shocking win.
The loss had no bearing on the playoff seeding for the Warriors (57-25). The two-time defending champions enter the postseason as the top seed in the Western Conference and they will open the playoffs against the No. 8 seed, the Los Angeles Clippers, who defeated the Utah Jazz, 143-137, in overtime Wednesday.
The win allowed the Grizzlies (33-49) to avoid what would have been a second straight season of at least 50 losses. Rookie Jevon Carter scored 19 of his career-high 32 points in the first half, when the Grizzlies ran off to an 86-68 lead.
76ers 125, Bulls 109
Jonathon Simmons scored 20 points and Boban Marjanovic added 18 to lift host Philadelphia over Chicago.
T.J. McConnell tied his career-high with 18, Zhaire Smith contributed 17 and Greg Monroe had 14 for the Sixers, who completed their regular season with a 51-31 record and the No. 3 playoff seed in the Eastern Conference. The Sixers finished 31-10 at home.
The Sixers were extremely short-handed as numerous key players were held out for precautionary reasons as the playoffs are about to begin. All-Star center Joel Embiid, All-Star guard Ben Simmons, guard JJ Redick, forward Jimmy Butler and forward Tobias Harris were all held out.

PHILADELPHIA — Rhys Hoskins hit two solo homers, Odubel Herrera hit a two-run shot and the Philadelphia Phillies beat the Washington Nationals 4-3 on Monday night.
Kurt Suzuki and Brian Dozier went deep for the Nationals.
Bryce Harper was 0 for 3 with a walk in his third game against his former team but helped prevent a run with a perfect relay throw.
Phillies right-hander Vince Velasquez allowed two runs and four hits in five innings in his first start this season. Seranthony Dominguez (1-0) tossed a perfect sixth, Adam Morgan and David Robertson each tossed scoreless innings.
Pat Neshek pitched out of trouble in the ninth for his first save.
Dozier led off the inning with a homer to cut the deficit to 4-3. Anthony Rendon followed with a double. But left fielder Andrew McCutchen ran down Juan Soto's drive to left, Ryan Zimmerman grounded out to second and Suzuki flied out to right.
Anibal Sanchez (0-1) gave up three runs and seven hits in 5 2/3 innings in his second start against Philadelphia in five days.
Hoskins, who hit a two-run homer a 2-1 win over Minnesota on Sunday, gave the Phillies a 3-2 lead in the sixth on his fourth homer. He took Justin Miller deep in the eighth to make it 4-2.
After circling the bases both times, Hoskins did a series of choreographed handshakes with several teammates.
Washington took a 2-0 lead in the second after Soto lined a double and Suzuki ripped a homer to left.
The Phillies tied it in the fourth when J.T. Realmuto hit a single and Herrera followed with a drive to the seats in right-center.
Zimmerman was thrown out trying to score from first base on Suzuki's hit in the fourth when Harper chased the ball down in right-center and quickly fired to shortstop Jean Segura, who threw a strike to catcher Realmuto.
Dozier homered in the ninth against Neshek. It's his first homer since signing a $9 million, one-year free agent deal. He totaled 76 homers between 2016-17 before disappointing last season with Minnesota and the Dodgers.
SEEING RED
Sanchez has made four straight starts against Philadelphia going back to his final two outings with the Braves last season. He's 5-10 career vs. the Phillies.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Nationals: OF Michael Taylor (right knee/hip sprain) was activated from the 10-day injured list. OF Andrew Stevenson was optioned to Triple-A Fresno.
Phillies: OF Roman Quinn (right oblique strain) will continue his rehab work in the minors, though the team hasn't decided whether he will move up to face tougher competition.
UP NEXT
RHP Aaron Nola (1-0, 7.00 ERA) goes for the Phillies and RHP Stephen Strasburg (1-0, 2.84) starts for the Nationals in a matchup of aces Tuesday night. Nola, who finished third in NL Cy Young award voting last year, got roughed up in Washington last week, allowing six runs in three innings.

Tampa Bay had a historically good regular season. But in the N.H.L., being the best regular-season team is far from a guarantee of postseason success.
By
Curtis Rush
TORONTO — The former N.H.L. executive Brian Burke sat high in the stands at Scotiabank Arena last Thursday watching the Tampa Bay Lightning practice ahead of a game against the Maple Leafs.
“They remind me of the Dallas Cowboys in their heyday,” said Burke, who won a Stanley Cup as general manager of the Anaheim Ducks in 2007. “No weaknesses and a lot of star power.”
Tampa Bay went on to beat Toronto that night, 3-1, and two days later, closed out the Boston Bruins, 6-3, for its record-tying 62nd win this season.
With a 62-16-4 record, the Lightning tied the 1995-96 Red Wings for the most wins in a season. And Tampa Bay, with 128 points, fell just short of one huge benchmark — the record 132 points achieved by the 1976-77 Montreal Canadiens (60-8-12), who were regarded as one of the best, if not the best, N.H.L. teams ever.
Tampa Bay finished with 12 more wins, and 21 more points, than the next closest team, the Calgary Flames. The Lightning did not lose more than two consecutive games all season.
But winning the Presidents’ Trophy as the best regular-season team is far from a guarantee of postseason success. The 1976-77 Canadiens won the Stanley Cup; the 1995-96 Red Wings did not.
On the 32 previous occasions that the Presidents’ Trophy has been awarded, only eight regular-season champions, or 25 percent, followed up with Stanley Cup titles. The last one was the Chicago Blackhawks in 2012-13.
The Lightning begin their first-round playoff series against the Columbus Blue Jackets on Wednesday well aware that history may regard them as a bust — or not regard them at all — if they don’t win a championship.
Eastern Conference
Tampa Bay Lightning vs. Columbus Blue Jackets
Boston Bruins vs. Toronto Maple Leafs
Washington Capitals vs. Carolina Hurricanes
Islanders vs. Pittsburgh Penguins
Western Conference
Nashville Predators vs. Dallas Stars
Winnipeg Jets vs. St. Louis Blues
Calgary Flames vs. Colorado Avalanche
San Jose Sharks vs. Vegas Golden Knights
[
Complete first-round schedule
.]
The division-based playoff format, introduced for the 2013-14 season, does not help the Lightning’s cause.
Tampa Bay and Boston both play in the Atlantic Division and were the top two teams in the Eastern Conference. But one of them won’t get past the second round.
Lightning Coach Jon Cooper understands that success is often built on failure. Sometimes repeated failure. Under his tutelage, Tampa Bay advanced to three conference finals in the last four years and reached the Stanley Cup finals in 2015.
A dozen or so players are left from that 2014-15 team, which
lost to the Blackhawks in six games
. Back then, Cooper said, he struggled to stay positive as he exchanged handshakes with the winners.
In the handshake lineup was Scotty Bowman, a nine-time Stanley Cup winner as a coach and Chicago’s senior adviser of hockey operations.
Cooper will never forget what Bowman told him.
“You’ll be back soon,” said Bowman, who happens to have been the coach of the 1976-77 Canadiens and the 1995-96 Red Wings. “Don’t worry about it. I lost my first 12 Stanley Cup finals games.”
The Lightning lost the Eastern Conference finals in seven games the next year. Then last season Tampa Bay — already loaded with superstar talent in forwards Steven Stamkos and Nikita Kucherov, goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy and defenseman Victor Hedman — added what it thought were the final two pieces by acquiring defenseman Ryan McDonagh and forward J.T. Miller
from the Rangers at the trade deadline
.
But the Lightning lost to the Washington Capitals in the Eastern Conference finals in seven games.
In their first full season in Tampa Bay, McDonagh has had a resurgent season, ranking No. 2 in the league with a plus-38 rating, and Miller tallied 47 points.
“This is the effect you’re getting,” Cooper said. “A year later, when everybody is more comfortable, and they know what grocery store to go to, now they’re here just to play hockey. There are no other distractions, and we’re reaping the benefits of last year’s trade deadline.”
Other off-season adjustments have paid dividends.
Tampa Bay has No. 1-ranked power play and penalty killing units, but last season the Lightning were ranked 28th out of 31 teams in penalty killing efficiency.
Rick Bowness, who oversaw the defensive unit, was let go along with assistant coach Brad Lauer. Derek Lalonde was hired with Jeff Halpern to work with the forwards, and Todd Richards was hired to focus on the defense.
During a nine-game stretch in November, the Lightning gave up 13 power-play goals. Richards called a players meeting. The players took ownership of the problems and became more attentive to the “habit reminders” the coaches like to drill into them, like finishing their checks.
“It takes away holes in your game when you’re constantly doing things correctly,” Lalonde said.
Cooper saw signs that Kucherov, 25, was filling holes in his game this off-season, when he stayed in the Tampa area and rented a rink by himself so he could skate five days a week.
“His hockey mind is so elite and the physical side is catching up,” Cooper said.
Kucherov finished with 128 points, the most for a Russian player in N.H.L. history and the most for a league scoring champion since Mario Lemieux’s 161 in the 1995-96 season. He is the favorite to win the Hart Trophy as the league’s most valuable player.
Kucherov’s emergence has taken the pressure off Stamkos, 29, to be the dominant star. Stamkos responded by surpassing the 40-goal mark for the first time since 2014-15, and he hit a career high with 98 points. Kucherov, who is sneaky quick with the puck and makes good reads, also helped center Brayden Point score a career-high 41 goals.
Leading them all is Cooper, 51. Bowman, who follows the Lightning closely from his home in Sarasota, Fla., traces the team’s success to 2011-12, when Cooper showed an ability to put teams on a roll and keep them there.
He led the Norfolk Admirals, the Lightning’s American Hockey League affiliate at the time, to a record 28-game winning streak that culminated in a Calder Cup championship.
In March 2013, the Lightning promoted Cooper,
who was a public defender
in Michigan before making coaching his career. He has perfected the art of persuasion and negotiation with his players.
“He just has that balance in today’s N.H.L.,” said Lalonde, one of Cooper’s assistants. “He can be hard on players, but he cares about them too. The guys know he has their back.”
Cooper has claimed championships in the A.H.L. and in three junior hockey leagues. A Silver Cup. A Robertson Cup. A Clark Cup. A Calder Cup.
The Stanley Cup has eluded him, but this year, just maybe, it could be Cooper’s turn.

SAN FRANCISCO — Brandon Belt homered and drove in three before an unusually small home crowd, and the San Francisco Giants beat the Tampa Bay Rays 6-4 on Saturday.
Steven Duggar had three RBIs and Joe Panik scored twice to help San Francisco snap a three-game losing streak behind a breakout day from its offense.
Belt had an RBI single in the third and hit a two-run, opposite-field home run off Ryan Yarbrough (1-1) as part of a four-run fifth.
Ji-Man Choi had two hits and two RBIs for Tampa Bay. Tommy Pham walked in the first inning to extend his on-base streak to 41 games, an ongoing franchise record dating to last season.
The Rays entered the day 6-2, their best start in club history, but couldn't hold an early lead.
The game drew 31,828, the smallest at Oracle Park since Sept. 1, 2010. The Giants set an NL record with 530 consecutive sellouts at their waterfront ballpark from 2010-17.
The fans who did show up witnessed the Giants set a season high for scoring after being limited to five runs in the previous 18 innings.
Belt and Duggar combined to drive in all six runs for San Francisco, but the Giants also got a lift from the bottom third of the order. Kevin Pillar, the No. 7 hitter, singled and scored in the third, Panik walked twice and scored both times, and Connor Joe had a pinch-hit single as part of the four-run fifth.
Travis Bergen (1-0) retired one batter in relief of starter Jeff Samardzija to earn his first career victory. Will Smith pitched the ninth for his third save.
Yarbrough allowed four runs in three innings.
Tampa Bay used reliever Ryne Stanek as the opener. Stanek, who also started Monday against Colorado, retired all six batters he faced.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Rays: Manager Kevin Cash had hoped to give slumping SS Willy Adames the day off. Instead, Adames singled and scored as a pinch-hitter in the fifth and singled in the ninth. Adames entered the day 1 for 27.
UP NEXT
LHP Drew Pomeranz (0-0, 3.60) pitches for San Francisco in the series finale Sunday at Oracle Park. Pomeranz went winless in two games last season. Cash has yet to announce who will pitch for Tampa Bay.

LAWRENCE, Kan. — Among all the changes that have taken place at Kansas since Les Miles was hired to resurrect the moribund football program, the easiest to notice is the title of the spring game.
It's called ""Late Night Under the Lights.""
Might as well try to channel whatever you can from your powerhouse basketball program.
The ""Late Night in the Phog"" each September the annual tipoff of yet another basketball season full of expectations. The event Saturday night in Memorial Stadium represents much more: It is the start of what Miles hopes is a new era for Kansas football.
""The adjustment, the culture and what we want to do, they're ready,"" said Miles, who was hired at the end of last season to replace the fired David Beaty. ""We're pleased. We have work to do, we're not done, but we sure are pleased with the effort.""
It takes more than effort to win at Kansas, though.
The program has won just six games over the past three-plus seasons, and the last winning season belonged to Mark Mangino. Since he was walking the sideline, Kansas has churned through Turner Gill, Charlie Weis, interim coach Clint Bowen and Beaty, whose departure appeared amicable at first but now includes a lawsuit over money he says he is owed.
The 65-year-old Miles has been busy. His first, frantic recruiting class is in place, his coaching staff has been hired and spring practices have just about come and gone, the barest bones of his new-look offensive system and the defense the Jayhawks will play this fall already in place.
""We've kind of introduced some of the segments that are going to be consistent,"" Miles said, ""but what happens is you have to pay your dues on those kind of situations. You have to stay after it, and you have to practice it again and again, and we're a ways away from that.""
Miles guessed that about half the playbook will be in place when Kansas caps its night under the lights with a scrimmage. But he also said that his to-do list is largely ""superfluous.""
""It really makes no difference, is what that means,"" Miles said. ""The issue is when we get a feel and a grasp for our guys, then that offense and that defense will change some, because of what we can do. So we're not there yet.""
Kansas still has the entire summer and fall before it steps back onto the field for its opener against Indiana State on Aug 31. And the Jayhawks will need every rep of every day as they try to reach a competitive level in Miles' first season in charge.
Then again, Miles knows what he's doing.
He took over a losing program at Oklahoma State and was headed to a bowl game within two years, then won nine games in his third year. He wound up with winning records his final three seasons in Stillwater before departing for LSU, where he won at least 11 games his first three seasons.
Miles capped that run with a national title in 2007, then returned to the title game again in 2011, going unbeaten in the rugged SEC before losing to Alabama at the Superdome.
He was fired after going 9-3 in 2015 and starting 2-2 the following year, an ignominious end to a tenure at LSU in which Miles went 114-34 and never failed to reach a bowl game.
The past seven Kansas coaches combined — counting interims — won 94 games.
Yes, Miles know what it takes to win, not only on the field but off. He has quickly made inroads on the recruiting trail, established relationships with high-level donors, and he has revamped the old spring game Saturday night into something that is more festival than football.
There's a BMX bike performance. A student flag football championship. There is even a concert by Rick Ross, where the first 500 students who attended a recent open practice got pit passes.
It's the kind of excitement and energy that has been missing at Kansas for years. The kind of excitement and energy Miles has seen out of his team, too.
""Right away, this team has given me effort, right away, which is the right thing,"" Miles said after a recent practice. ""They want it. And that really helps a coach.""

SAN ANTONIO — Dirk Nowitzki said goodbye to the NBA the same way he came into the league, smoothly draining a jumper over a defender to punctuate a passionate performance.
It was only fitting that Nowitzki's final shot came against the San Antonio Spurs, a team he terrorized in the regular season and postseason. This time, however, the tears it stirred were tears of joy.
LaMarcus Aldridge had 34 points and 16 rebounds and the Spurs beat the Dallas Mavericks 105-94 Wednesday night in Nowitzki's final game.
""Everybody, players, fans, coaches and staff got to witness history watching him play his last game,"" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. ""He played a fine game, which was great. It's not surprising.""
Nowitzki finished with 20 points and 10 rebounds in the finale of his storied 21-season career — all with the Mavericks. Nowitzki announced he was retiring Tuesday night following Dallas' final home game of the season.
Wednesday's sell-out crowd cheered wildly each time Nowitzki entered the game or touched the ball and let out a collective groan when he missed a shot. He was serenaded with chants of ""MVP!"" throughout the game by the crowd filled with patrons wearing his No. 41 jersey.
""It was fantastic again tonight,"" Nowitzki said. ""Felt almost like a home game, honestly.""
The Spurs couldn't afford any sentimentality with playoff positioning at stake, and they didn't show any. San Antonio raced to a double-figure lead and led by as many as 22 points.
The Spurs finished seventh in the Western Conference as a result of Oklahoma City's 127-116 victory over Milwaukee. They will face the No. 2 seed, either Denver or Houston, in the opening round of the playoffs.
The regular-season finale turned out to be a win for everyone. San Antonio won, Nowitzki led the Mavericks in scoring and Popovich, the Spurs and San Antonio's fans got to say goodbye to the future Hall of Famer.
""He was having a lot of fun tonight, I was really happy for him,"" Popovich said.
It was appropriate that Nowitzki's final game came against the Spurs, who he has had many memorable battles against. Perhaps the most memorable was the 2006 Western Conference finals against San Antonio. After the Spurs battled back from a 3-1 series deficit and a 20-point lead in Game 7, Manu Ginobili fouled Nowitzki on a layup with 21.6 seconds remaining. Nowitzki made the free throw to forge a tie and the Mavs went on to win in overtime on the way to the franchise's first NBA Finals appearance.
""If it's not at home, this kind of works perfect,"" Nowitzki said of San Antonio. ""This team was always sort of the big brother. They were beating us and then we kind of found a way to get through them in '06. To me, probably still one of the best playoff series I've been a part of and probably some of the best basketball in that series that I've ever played in my life.""
Nowitzki was able to turn back the clock, shooting 8 for 21 in 32 minutes, including going 2 for 6 on 3-pointers. His final shot was a 20-footer over Spurs rookie Drew Eubanks with 49.7 seconds remaining.
Dallas coach Rick Carlisle subbed Nowitzki following the shot, leading to an ovation of cheers and chants of ""Dirk"" and ""MVP.""
""It's cool playing against Dirk tonight,"" Spurs guard DeMar DeRozan said. ""Seeing him out there and playing against one of the greatest of all time for the last time, it was cool. Hopefully, I got a good photo op.""
Derozan finished with 19 points and Derrick White added 14 for the Spurs, who finished with a 49-34 record.
Justin Jackson and Courtney Lee added 14 points each for Dallas, which was without Rookie of the Year candidate Luka Doncic.
TIP-INS
Mavericks: Nowitzki averaged 15.3 minutes and started 20 games this season, the lowest numbers of his career. He started 24 games as a rookie while playing 20.4 minutes. ... Nowitzki has played 38 games in San Antonio, tied for the third-highest total of any player. Utah legends Karl Malone and John Stockton each played 46 games in San Antonio. Denver's Alex English played 39, and Houston's Hakeem Olajuwon played 38. ... Doncic missed three of Dallas' final four games due to a thigh injury. He missed back-to-back games against Memphis with a bruised right thigh, played 32 minutes against Phoenix, and missed the team's finale with a bruised left thigh.
Spurs: Bryn Forbes finished with 10 points in 26 minutes. . San Antonio only had four players in double figures.
THANK YOU, DIRK
The Spurs played a 1 ½-minute tribute video in honor of Nowitzki, highlighting his 21 seasons in the NBA.
Nowitzki looked up to watch the video on the big screen at the AT&T Center, but had to turn away as he began to cry.
""The first 20, 30 seconds, I was kind of holding it (in),"" Nowitzki said. ""I was like, 'That's sweet,' and then it just kind of all came out. I'm not sure why. Not only did they show highlights from my career, but they showed highlights from me beating up on the Spurs, which was even more incredible.""

HOUSTON — Jose Altuve needed video review to confirm his first home run Wednesday night.
His second shot was a no-doubter — just like the Houston Astros' status as a team to beat in the American League.
Altuve hit two homers, Carlos Correa homered with three RBIs and the Astros completed their first ever sweep of the New York Yankees with an 8-6 win Wednesday night.
The Astros required late-game comebacks to win the first two games of the series but used a four-run fifth inning to break the finale open and held on for their sixth straight win despite a big eighth inning by the Yankees.
It's the first time since 2004 the Astros have swept a homestand of at least two series. They beat the Athletics three times this weekend before the Yankees arrived.
The 5-foot-6 Altuve didn't have an explanation for his recent power surge.
""I want to know, too to do it again,"" he said. ""I'm as surprised as you are. I'm not used to hitting this many homers in two or three games, but I'll take it.""
Manager AJ Hinch said Altuve's health and timing have contributed to the recent barrage, but he isn't surprised by anything the 2017 AL MVP does.
""He's seeing the ball, sure, picking the right pitches of course (but) he's just pretty damn good,"" he said.
Altuve hit his first one off James Paxton (1-2) to tie it at 1 in the first inning after Brett Gardner hit a leadoff homer for New York. Altuve's hit was initially ruled a double, but a review showed it cleared the wall.
The Astros were up by 1 with no outs in the fifth inning when Altuve connected off Paxton again. The towering shot clanged off the light pole atop the wall in left field to make it 4-2.
A single by Michael Brantley chased Paxton, who was replaced by Tommy Kahnle. He was greeted by a two-run home run by Correa that extended Houston's lead to 6-2. Houston made it 7-2 on an RBI single by Jake Marisnick with two outs in the inning.
Houston starter Collin McHugh (2-1) allowed four hits and two runs while striking out nine in six innings for his second straight win.
Yankees slugger Luke Voit hit a two-run homer off Josh James with no outs in the eighth, DJ LeMahieu hit an RBI double and Clint Frazier added a sacrifice fly to make it 7-6. There were two outs in the inning and a runner on third when Ryan Pressly took over and struck out pinch-hitter Gary Sanchez.
Pressly stayed on for the ninth, allowing one hit in a scoreless inning for his first save.
The Astros jumped on Paxton for eight hits and five runs in four-plus innings after he went 4-0 with a 2.05 ERA in four starts against them last year while with Seattle. He wasn't helped when Gardner badly misplayed Yuli Gurriel's drive to center, resulting in an RBI triple in the first.
""We got to tighten up a little bit, play a little bit better, but I believe we are really close to turning the corner ... this is a little bump in the road,"" manager Aaron Boone said. ""That is inevitable in a major league season, and we will work our way out of it.""
TRAINER'S ROOM
Yankees: Sanchez didn't start Wednesday because of tightness in his lower leg. ... 3B Miguel Andujar (right shoulder) made 25 throws from 60 feet Wednesday. ""I think he felt a lot better than he expected,"" Boone said. He will play catch and swing a bat Friday. If that goes well, he'll start throwing from 90 feet Saturday. ... OF Giancarlo Stanton (left biceps strain) hit off a tee on Wednesday. ... OF Aaron Hicks (lower back strain) will do soft toss, hit off a tee and run on a treadmill this week, and Boone said they hope that by next Wednesday he'll be hitting in the cage and be on the field running and throwing.
Astros: 3B Alex Bregman was out of the lineup Wednesday after leaving late in Tuesday night's game with a sore hamstring. Manager AJ Hinch doesn't think the problem is serious and hopes that he can return Friday.
YANKEES MOVE
New York optioned RHP Jonathan Loaisiga to Triple-A after Tuesday's game and recalled RHP Joe Harvey from Scranton before Wednesday's game. Harvey made his major league debut in the fifth inning and yielded one hit in two scoreless innings.
UP NEXT
Yankees: New York is off Thursday before beginning a series against the Chicago White Sox on Friday. The Yankees haven't announced their Friday starter, but Boone said CC Sabathia will come off the injured list to make his first start of the season Saturday.
Astros: Houston has a day off Thursday and opens a three-game series at Seattle with Wade Miley (1-1, 2.31 ERA) on Friday night. Miley allowed four hits in 5 2/3 scoreless innings to get the win against Oakland in his last start.

ESPOO, Finland — Kendall Coyne Schofield and Lee Stecklein scored two goals each, and the United States routed Russia 10-0 Tuesday in the final game of the preliminary round at the women's world championship.
Annie Pankowski had three assists, and Alex Carpenter added two as 15 Americans had at least a point. The United States wrapped up pool play undefeated for a fourth straight world championship. The U.S. will play Japan, a 3-2 winner over Sweden, in the quarterfinals Thursday.
Amanda Kessel scored the first goal a couple minutes in, Cayla Barnes followed at 13:44 and Coyne Schofield stole the puck and scored 17 seconds later as the U.S. took a 3-0 lead in the first period.
Stecklein scored her first goal in IIHF tournament play at 8:18 of the second, making it 5-0. That forced Russian goalie Valeria Merkusheva to the bench with Anna Prugova replacing her in net. The U.S. wound up with four goals in the second and added three more in the third.
Alex Rigsby made 12 saves for her third win in this tournament.
Canada was playing Finland later Tuesday while the Czech Republic faced Germany in the final games of the preliminary round.

CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. — Virginia's national champion men's basketball team is back on campus and when the Cavaliers returned, they were greeted by a throng of several thousand fans.
The Cavaliers won their first men's basketball national championship on Monday night, defeating Texas Tech 85-77 in overtime in Minneapolis.
The crowd Tuesday chanted ""U-V-A, UVA"" as police motorcycles escorted the busses carrying the team into the parking lot of John Paul Jones Arena. The players and coaches walked down a path set off by barricades, high-fiving fans on their way to a podium. Virginia post player Mamadi Diakite drew huge cheers when he got off the bus holding the national championship trophy high above his head, and the crowd chanted ""Tony, Tony"" when coach Tony Bennett emerged.
Bennett the addressed the crowd, saying, ""I guess this really happened. We won the national championship."" And fans erupted again.

LOS ANGELES — Mick Cronin has been hired as UCLA's basketball coach, ending a months-long search to find a replacement for the fired Steve Alford.
The university says Cronin agreed to a $24 million, six-year deal Tuesday.
He leaves his alma mater Cincinnati after 16 seasons, having led the Bearcats to the NCAA Tournament in each of the last nine years.
The 47-year-old coach will be introduced at a campus news conference Wednesday.
Cronin's only other head coaching stint was at Murray State from 2003-06. He was associate head coach at Louisville from 2001-03 and worked as an assistant and video coordinator from 1996 to 2001 at Cincinnati.
Alford was fired on Dec. 31.

MINNEAPOLIS — Dick Bennett has a difficult time watching his son, Tony, coach Virginia. He rarely attends games.
""I'm not a model of decorum or poise,"" said Dick Bennett, the former longtime high school and college basketball coach. ""But I needed to be here.""
The Cavaliers didn't make it easy on the elder Bennett, beating Texas Tech 85-77 on Monday night in the first overtime NCAA championship game in 11 years. When it was over, Dick and Tony Bennett shared a hug on a court covered in confetti and then posed for a picture with the whole family before the son went to cut down the net.
""Words aren't very accurate when your emotions outrun them and that's kind of where I am right now,"" Dick Bennett said.
Bennett, 75, drew the blueprint that Tony used to turn Virginia into a national champion. He practically invented the so-called pack line defense the Cavaliers use to squeeze the life out of opponents. With a deliberate style and stingy defense, Dick Bennett found a way to close the gap on the more talented teams. He took Wisconsin to a Final Four in 2000, the Badgers' first in 59 years. That was as far as one of his teams ever got, but Tony Bennett was sure that same game plan could take Virginia even further.
""He's so far past me,"" Dick Bennett said of his son's coaching. ""I feel like I'm back in kindergarten.""
Dick Bennett sat behind the bench Monday night, trying to keep it together during Virginia's latest nail-biter in the tournament. While he said he doesn't coach along anymore, Bennett couldn't help but point and signal for the Cavaliers to get back on defense a few times as Texas Tech responded to every Virginia run.
""I'd probably do that when I'm sleeping,"" Bennett said.
Tony Bennett followed his father as head coach at Washington State in 2006, then moved on to Virginia in 2009. Slowly, fittingly, Bennett built up the program to one that could go head-to-head with Duke and North Carolina without a load of five-star recruits.
The only thing missing on his resume was a Final Four run, like his dad. Tony and Dick Bennett became the second father-son combination to coach in the Final Four, joining Georgetown's John Thompson and John Thompson III.
In Bennett's case, the son brought home the championship that eluded the father. Dick Bennett did not attend the Final Four game against Auburn on Saturday, another heart-pounding victory for Virginia. Tony Bennett said his father told him Monday he would show up for this one, but the son still wasn't certain.
""I'm so glad he came to that last game,"" Tony Bennett said. ""Great to be able to share this stuff with your dad and family and his impact's been huge on me.""
Not just on his son. Dick Bennett is practically the godfather of defense to a generation of basketball coaches.
Bennett's instructional video ""Pressure Defense: A System"" was a must-watch for coaches, said former St. John's and New Mexico coach Fran Fraschilla.
Bennett's teams played a more in-your-face man-to-man when he was at Wisconsin-Stevens Point, an NAIA school. When he got to Division I at Wisconsin-Green Bay, his teams didn't have the athletic advantage.
""So he had to radically alter his defense,"" Fraschilla said. ""So he switched 180 from an extended defense to a packed in defense. It's an amazing transformation. The pack line defense was born out of necessity.""
Not always aesthetically pleasing, Virginia's style — Dick Bennett's style — has been easy to criticize when it fails. Never more so than last year, when Virginia became the first No. 1 seed to lose in the first round to a No. 16.
Dick Bennett said his son dealt with the loss better than he ever could have.
""The way he's kind of always dealt with things,"" Dick Bennett said. ""He has a higher view of things.""
As much as Dick Bennett was thrilled to be there to share his son's joy, the highlight of either's coaching careers, that's not why he felt so compelled to steel himself and come to U.S. Bank Stadium on Monday night.
""I thought it was more important to be here in case they lost,"" Dick Bennett said. ""Not be there at a moment when things don't go right, that's when a parent needs to be around. So he didn't need me here, but I guess I felt I needed to.""

MINNEAPOLIS — Virginia pulled off one of the great redemption stories in NCAA Tournament history, winning its first national title a year after losing to a No. 16 seed in the first round.
The bad news: it's seven months until the next season.
The confetti is still being swept up in Minnesota, but it's never too early to start looking ahead for college basketball fans.
OK, maybe it is a little too early, but we're going to do it anyway.
A look at a way-too-early poll for the 2019-20 season:
1. Michigan State. The Spartans made it to the Final Four without Joshua Langford. He should be healthy and nearly everyone should be back.
2. Virginia. De'Andre Hunter is a projected NBA lottery pick, so he's likely be gone. If Ty Jerome returns, the Cavaliers could be in the running for a second straight title.
3. Kentucky. Another year, another big roster turnover. Then again, Coach John Calipari has another stellar recruiting class coming in.
4. Michigan. The Wolverines were not supposed be this good this year. Even with Charles Matthews likely leaving, they're expected to be good in 2019-20 if no one else leaves.
5. Duke. Zion, R.J. and Cam will not be back. Tre Jones is, so the Blue Devils should be in good shape with another top-notch recruiting class coming to Durham.
6. Marquette. Ranking the Golden Eagles this high is all about Markus Howard. He doesn't come back, they drop several spots.
7. Gonzaga. Rui Hachimura may leave Spokane early, but if Brandon Clarke doesn't, watch out for the Zags.
8. Oregon. No Bol Bol (likely), but Payton Pritchard, Louis King (maybe) and a strong recruiting class is going to be tough to beat.
9. Kansas. The Lawson brothers are gone, but getting the big Doke back is huge for the Jayhawks.
10. Maryland. Losing Bruno Fernando would hurt, but there's a lot coming back.
11. Ohio State. The starting backcourt graduates, but there are plenty of good young players to step up.
12. Texas Tech. Losing Jarrett Culver, Matt Mooney and Tariq Owens hurts, but never count out Chris Beard after leading his host of grinders to the national title game.
13. Louisville. Leading scorer Jordan Nwora could be off to the NBA, but Chris Mack is already pulling the recruiting strings.
14. Arizona. Sean Miller regained his recruiting prowess with another stellar group coming in, though the federal investigation still hangs over the program.
15. Villanova. The loss of Eric Paschal and Phil Booth puts a big dent in the Wildcats' leadership, but Jay Wright has dipped into the five-star recruiting pool with one of the nation's top classes.
16. LSU. Another team caught up in the federal recruiting investigation. The Tigers have plenty coming back, though, particularly if point guard Tremont Waters stays.
17. Florida State. Mfiondu Kabengele and a pair of top recruits should help make up for the losses of five seniors.
18. North Carolina. The Tar Heels will have a massive roster turnover, but Ol' Roy should have high-quality replacements for them.
19. Tennessee. Grant Williams and Jordan Bone returning could make the Vols a top-10 team. They'll be solid even if both leave.
20. Arizona State. The Sun Devils may lose Luguentz Dort and Zylan Cheatham graduates, but nearly everyone else should be back from an NCAA Tournament team.
21. Auburn. A healthy Chuma Okeke and getting Jared Harper back could lead to another deep Tigers' run.
22. Seton Hall. The Pirates have plenty coming back and Myles Powell would make them a top 25 team.
23. Saint Mary's. The Gaels get nearly everyone back from its tournament team.
24. Iowa. This could be Fran McCaffrey's best team in Ames.
25. Purdue. Losing Carsen Edwards to an early exit makes the Boilermakers much less dangerous.

CINCINNATI — Matt Kemp started Cincinnati's spree of three consecutive homers, Luis Castillo dominated again, and the Reds snapped their eight-game losing streak Tuesday night, beating the Miami Marlins 14-0 shortly after their manager and an outfielder were suspended.
The Reds hit five homers in all as they won for the first time since opening day. Their 2-8 mark matches last season's start.
The Reds were missing outfielder Yasiel Puig and manager David Bell, suspended for their part in a fracas in Pittsburgh on Sunday. Puig decided to serve his two-game suspension rather than appeal. Bell got a one-game punishment, and bench coach Freddie Benavides took his place for the series opener.
Benavides didn't have any difficult decisions as the Reds emerged from a deep hitting slump. They batted .167 during the losing streak, scored a total of 20 runs, and were shut out four times.
Castillo (1-1) allowed only a pair of singles and a walk over seven innings and struck out eight. In three starts, the right-hander has given up only five hits and two runs in 19 2/3 innings.
Jesse Winker hit a two-run homer in the fourth inning off Jose Urena (0-3), who has failed to build upon his solid finish last season. Urena won his last six decisions last season, a career high, but has given up 14 runs in only 13 2/3 innings this season.
The Reds put it away in the sixth inning by hitting three straight homers for the first time since 2012. Kemp hit a three-run shot off Wei-Yin Chen, and Eugenio Suarez and Scott Schebler also connected as Cincinnati surged ahead 11-0. Kyle Farmer added a three-run homer in the seventh.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Marlins: Catcher Jorge Alfaro got hit on the top of the head by Winker's bat on his swing in the sixth inning. After a few moments to recover, Alfaro stayed in the game. He had a passed ball on the next pitch.
Reds: Right-hander Hunter Greene had Tommy John surgery. The Reds announced last week that Greene, the second overall pick in the 2017 June draft, had torn the ligament and would need surgery. ... Joey Votto was hit in the ribs by a pitch from Chen in the sixth. He stayed in the game and ran the bases, and was replaced at first base the next inning.
UP NEXT
Marlins: Trevor Richards (0-1) threw seven innings in his only appearance against the Reds, allowing only three hits and fanning nine during a 6-0 victory last Sept. 23.
Reds: Tyler Mahle (0-0) threw six scoreless innings, allowing five hits, in a 2-0 loss in Pittsburgh on Thursday.

CHICAGO — Austin Meadows homered and set a career high with four hits, Avisail Garcia connected against his former team and the Tampa Bay Rays beat the Chicago White Sox 10-5 on Tuesday.
The Rays pounded Ervin Santana (0-1) and improved to 9-3, their best start in nine years. They also extended a club record by clinching their fourth straight series victory to start a season.
Meadows helped break open a game that lasted 3 hours, 56 minutes. He singled and scored in the first, hit a two-run drive in the second and added an RBI single during a two-run fourth in which Tampa Bay chased Santana. He also walked with the bases loaded in the ninth.
Garcia smacked a solo homer in the second and finished with three hits, giving him five in the past two games. The White Sox opted not to offer him a contract in the offseason, parting ways after 5½ years, and he signed with Tampa Bay.
Brandon Lowe chipped in with a sacrifice fly in the first and a solo homer in the third. Charlie Morton (2-0) went five innings, allowing two runs and three hits.
Santana got tagged for seven runs and seven hits in 3 2/3 innings after the White Sox purchased his contract from Triple-A Charlotte. The two-time All-Star missed most of last season with Minnesota because of an injured right middle finger. He signed a minor league contract in February.
Yoan Moncada knocked a two-run homer in the third. Tim Anderson had two hits, including an RBI single in a three-run eighth. But with Chicago trailing by three, pinch-hitter Adam Engel struck out swinging at a 3-2 pitch with the bases loaded to end that rally.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Rays: 2B Joey Wendle (strained left hamstring) ran on a treadmill for the second straight day, manager Kevin Cash said. Cash also said 3B Matt Duffy (back/left hamstring) has been ramping up his rehab.
White Sox: Manager Rick Renteria had no timetable on when OF Jon Jay will return and said it's a ""safe bet"" Jay will go on a rehab assignment before he is activated. Jay has been sidelined since last month because of a strained right hip that has caused pain in the groin area.
UP NEXT
Rays: RHP Tyler Glasnow (2-0, 0.82 ERA) looks to continue his dominant start. He tossed three-hit ball over six scoreless innings at San Francisco last week after holding Houston to one run over five innings.
White Sox: RHP Reynaldo López (0-1, 10.00) tries to get on track after two shaky outings. He has allowed a combined 10 runs on 12 hits over nine innings against Kansas City and Seattle.

AUGUSTA, Ga. — Ed Sneed sat on a sofa in Butler Cabin at Augusta National looking as though he didn't know what hit him.
He had a three-shot lead with three holes to play in the 1979 Masters and didn't do anything horribly wrong, except nothing went right. He finished with three straight bogeys and faced a sudden-death playoff with Fuzzy Zoeller and Tom Watson, which Zoeller won with a birdie on the second extra hole at No. 11.
Arnold Palmer was conducting the interview in Butler Cabin and sympathized. So did Watson, who was sitting next to Sneed. Watson had lost in a three-way playoff the previous major at the PGA Championship, which cost him the career Grand Slam.
""I know what it feels like to be in that position,"" Watson said. ""All the condolences in the world wouldn't fix what the hurt is right now inside of him. He'll have plenty of tournaments left. He's a great player. He showed it this week.""
There were other tournaments, sure, but Sneed played the Masters only three more times.
He never got another chance.
The hurt never really goes away.
""It's something that sticks with you,"" Sneed said from his home in Ohio. ""I never won many tour events, but I'm remembered more for losing that one.""
At the Masters, he's not alone.
The fabled green jacket is almost close enough to feel it slipped over the shoulders, and then it's gone. And for some, the opportunity never returns.
Scott Hoch missed a 3-foot putt in a playoff in 1989 and lost to Nick Faldo on the next hole. Hoch at least had another chance six years later when he went into the final round one shot out of the lead, shot 73 and tied for fifth.
Greg Norman is not the most frequent runner-up at the Masters, just the most famous. He had more than one opportunity.
Not so for Chad Campbell in 2009, the first man out in a three-man playoff won by Angel Cabrera.
""It was early enough in my career, I felt like I was going to have a lot more opportunities to have a chance to win,"" said Campbell, missing the Masters this year for the ninth straight year.
Not for Len Mattiace in 2003, who lost in a playoff to Mike Weir.
""It hurt that night,"" Mattiace said. ""I played Hilton Head the next week and it hurt the same. It didn't really change ever.""
Sneed won four times on the PGA Tour — oddly enough, three were in a playoff — and he was right that he is known more for the one playoff he lost. For about a dozen years after that Masters, he could count on someone calling and wanting to talk about that shocking finish.
""I've replayed that many, many times in my mind,"" Sneed said. ""Actually, it's the only place you can replay it because you can't go back there.""
Mattiace's only chance was in 2003, right after Augusta National had super-sized the golf course. Even with a bogey on the 18th hole, Mattiace shot a 65 in the final round and was on the verge of winning until Weir finished with two tough par putts.
The playoff effectively ended in one shot. Mattiace went first at the par-4 10th and tugged it left, stymied by a tree. He chipped through the green, and his par putt ran to the fringe. He missed that one, too, taking double bogey.
""I tried to keep perspective,"" Mattiace said. ""I had a great tournament. I shot 65. Everything was great. But when you get in that position, you want to cap it off and get a W. So I keep that perspective. But it hurts just the same.""
Later that year, Mattiace tore knee ligaments while skiing and when he returned to the Masters, he could barely walk and missed the cut.
That turned out to be his last Masters.
Campbell never expected to be in a playoff in 2009 until Kenny Perry bogeyed his last two holes. Suddenly, Campbell had the advantage. Perry had come up short of the 18th green. Cabrera was in the trees and hit another tree trying to get out. He managed to save par.
""I drove it perfect, just up the right side and had 162 yards,"" Campbell said. ""It set up perfect for me. I'd like to have that one back.""
He put it into a bunker, blasted out to 5 feet and missed the par putt. Cabrera won on the next hole.
Campbell returned to Augusta National the next year, with no reason to believe that would be his last year. He doesn't let much in life linger. If anything causes him to think back, it's the Masters.
""The longer it goes, you look back and feel like it's the one that got away,"" he said.
Chris DiMarco played in the final group two straight years at the Masters. He had faded long before Phil Mickelson made his 18-foot putt to win his first major in 2004. There was no fading against Tiger Woods in 2005. DiMarco pushed all day until Woods made birdie on the first playoff hole.
""I've never gotten more notoriety than finishing second in a major,"" DiMarco said.
It was what he said that afternoon at Augusta that was so telling: ""I will be ready to win next year.""
But he fell while skiing and injured his back on a bottle that was in his backpack and wasn't quite the same. He played the Masters twice more and missed the cut.
And he never made it back.

ST. LOUIS — Austin Hedges and Manny Machado each hit a two-run homer off Andrew Miller in the eighth inning, helping the San Diego Padres beat the St. Louis Cardinals 6-4 on Saturday for their third consecutive win.
Fernando Tatis Jr. opened the eighth with a walk and Hedges followed with a go-ahead drive over the wall on in left. With two out and Ian Kinsler on first after a walk, Machado made it 6-3 with his second homer of the season.
It was the first time that Miller (0-1) allowed multiple homers in a game since Sept. 22, 2015 for the New York Yankees at Toronto.
Matt Wisler (1-0) pitched two scoreless innings for the win in his first outing with the Padres. Kirby Yates worked the ninth for his fifth save in five chances.

SAHARA DESERT, Morocco — The most popular runner in one of the world’s most difficult races is, strictly speaking, not an official entrant. Or even human.
A dog nicknamed Cactus suddenly appeared on Monday during the Marathon des Sables, a 140.7-mile stage race made harder by the heat, wind, sand dunes, rocks, stony plateaus and dry valleys of the Sahara in southern Morocco, the rough equivalent of running 23.5 miles a day for six days.
Cactus skipped Sunday’s first stage, but ran nearly 15 miles on Monday, then completed the full 23 miles of Tuesday’s stage and the entire 47.4-mile stage on Wednesday, showing great resilience and a skittering ability to navigate the dunes.
While the nearly 800 human runners were given 31 hours to complete Wednesday’s ultralong stage, Cactus needed only about 11 hours 15 minutes, some of it in a sandstorm, which would have put him 76th in the stage results. Then he ran a couple of extra miles to cool down.
Officially, Cactus has run more than 85 miles from his home village, and his canine wanderings have gone viral. A leading French animal magazine has inquired about Cactus’s life story and how he is being treated. A Moroccan television reporter went directly to the source and placed a microphone in Cactus’s face. Officials are now listing three categories of leaders: men, women and dog.
“I know he’s having the greatest time,” Karen Hadfield, a hotelier of British and Australian roots who owns an inn where Cactus lives, wrote Wednesday night on the Marathon des Sables’s Facebook page.
The dog is accustomed to the companionship of strangers. He is also a nomad who often travels about 25 miles a day around the area “just for fun” in this Berber region where humans and animals are familiar with long distances, Hadfield wrote.
A standard marathon-length stage of 26.2 miles is scheduled for Friday, followed by a concluding 3.8-mile stage for charity on Saturday. On Thursday, a race spokesman said that Hadfield planned to retrieve Cactus on Saturday at the finish line.
Until then, if he remains in the race, Cactus will sleep wherever he wants at the roving bivouac where runners, organizers, support crews and journalists camp nightly in tents. He is being given water at checkpoints on the course and food by runners and officials at various places, including the campsite. The medical crew said he appeared generally healthy.
While dozens of human runners line up daily to have their battered feet attended to after long days in thick-sole shoes and gaiters to keep out the sand, Cactus appears to be doing fine in bare paws.
“No blisters, nothing,” Anthony Serena, a podiatrist, said.
In the early mornings, Cactus makes his rounds at the runners’ tents, posing for photographs and rolling over for belly rubs. Then he trots easily to the front of the starting line and takes off with the pack as AC/DC’s “Highway to Hell” blares over the loudspeakers.
“Lots of runners are nervous in the morning, but he was pretty casual,” Meghan Hicks of Moab, Utah, who won the women’s race at the Marathon des Sables in 2013, said of Tuesday’s stage. “I think he was channeling the spirit of the day.”
Cactus joined the race on Monday, near a checkpoint at the Erg Chebbi, where runners entered a sea of dunes for eight miles of exhausting undulations. Well, exhausting for nearly everyone but Cactus.
“That dog was a beast; he ran right past me and I couldn’t keep up,” said Theo Holzapfel, a runner from London. “I kept following his footprints; I figured he knew where the hard sand was.”
On Tuesday, Stephen Homesy of Washington strayed from the line that most runners were taking through an area of small dunes and a dry valley, then began to wonder, “Am I headed to nowhere?”
Suddenly, Cactus appeared and Homesy followed, steered back on course.
“I don’t know why I followed, but it seemed to be a sign that he knew where he was going,” Homesy said.
Technically, Cactus failed to pay his hefty entry fee of about $3,500. And he is fresher than other runners, having skipped the first stage.
“He’s fast, but he has four legs, not two,” said Emmanuel Lamarle, a race spokesman.
Still, Valentin Campagnie, an official race photographer, placed a medal around Cactus’s neck after Tuesday’s stage. And Cactus did what every marathon runner does with his medal: walked around to show it off.
“He’s unbelievable,” Campagnie said of Cactus’s running ability. “His heart is little, not like a big human heart.”
Some were concerned about Cactus ahead of Wednesday’s brutally long stage of 47.4 miles.
At a checkpoint after 16 miles, Cactus vomited slightly, then rested in the shade of a military truck for a half-hour in the heat. He seemed to drink little or none of the water placed at his side. But he then got up and continued on his way, and seemed fresh at the finish hours later as temperatures cooled significantly in the dark.
“No one has seen anything like this,” said Mohamed Ouhassou, a Berber and driver who has ferried journalists during the Marathon des Sables since 2004.
In the Berber culture, Ouhassou said, dogs are viewed as workers to guard goats and other animals, not as pets. If organizers of the Marathon des Sables were Moroccan instead of French, Cactus would likely have been shooed off the course days ago, Ouhassou said.
Instead, his whereabouts are relayed during each stage with great anticipation.
“Maybe next year,” said Hassan Taouchikht, another driver, “all the runners will bring their dogs.”

Count Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James among those who were stunned by team president Magic Johnson's resignation on Tuesday night. But according to ESPN's Ramona Shelburne on Wednesday, James still stands behind the organization and Lakers owner Jeanie Buss.
ESPN also reported that head coach Luke Walton participated in exit meetings with the players on Wednesday. Walton's job security is in jeopardy after the Lakers (37-45) missed the playoffs for the sixth consecutive season despite the offseason signing of James to a four-year, $154 million deal.
James, 34, battled injuries and appeared in a career-low 55 games and averaged 27.4 points, 8.5 rebounds and 8.3 assists per game in 2018-19.
--Following his meeting with Walton, James headed to New York, where he, Chris Paul and Carmelo Anthony watched Dwyane Wade play his final NBA game. The Miami Heat closed out the season against the Brooklyn Nets.
After a pregame video tribute to Wade, the retiring superstar went over and hugged each of his three friends. The four have been friends for years, their bond immortalized by a photo of James, Wade and Paul riding a banana boat together while on vacation in 2015. Anthony was not in the picture but was also on vacation with the group.
--Boston Celtics guard Marcus Smart has a torn left oblique and could miss the first two rounds of the Eastern Conference playoffs, according to a report from ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.
Smart averaged 8.9 points, 4.0 assists and 2.9 rebounds this season for the Celtics, who will be the fourth seed in the East after posting a 49-33 regular-season record. Boston will open at home this weekend against the fifth-seeded Indiana Pacers. The physical guard is noted as one of the NBA's top defenders.
Smart sustained the injury in a game against the Orlando Magic on Sunday, and he did not play in Tuesday's regular-season finale at Washington.
--Anthony Davis acknowledged that despite his desire to leave New Orleans, he could begin the 2019-20 season with the Pelicans.
""I'm under contract still,"" Davis said during an informal season-ending news conference. ""I have a year left. Obviously it's a possibility it could happen. I don't have ill will toward anybody. I know that it's a possibility that next year I could be here as well. So I can't be mad if I'm here next year.""
Davis said his next step will be to see who emerges as the general manager for the Pelicans. Dell Demps was fired in February after his handling of the Davis situation, and Danny Ferry is the interim general manager.
--The Phoenix Suns have hired longtime NBA general manager Jeff Bower as their vice president of operations, Wojnarowski reported.
Bower, 57, was general manager of the then-New Orleans Hornets from October 2005 to July 2010, and he also served as the team's head coach for most of the 2009-10 season after the firing of Byron Scott.
The Suns have been without a general manager since Ryan McDonough was fired a week before the start of the 2018-19 season.
--The Minnesota Timberwolves plan to offer interim coach Ryan Saunders a multiyear deal as early as this week, league sources told ESPN.
Saunders, 32, is the youngest head coach in the league. He took over when Tom Thibodeau was fired in early January and has earned the endorsement of his players, most notably from All-Star center Karl-Anthony Towns.
The Timberwolves were 36-45 entering Wednesday night's season finale at Denver, including a 17-24 mark under Saunders' leadership. Saunders reportedly will receive a three-year deal with a team option on the final season.
--The Timberwolves also announced that guard Jeff Teague underwent successful debridement surgery Tuesday to clean out his left ankle. The team had no additional updates as to any recovery timetable.
Teague played in 42 games for the Minnesota this season, averaging 12.1 points and a career-best 8.2 assists in 30.1 minutes. The team shut him down for the season in mid-March.

Tampa Bay had a historically good regular season. But in the N.H.L., being the best regular-season team is far from a guarantee of postseason success.
By
Curtis Rush
TORONTO — The former N.H.L. executive Brian Burke sat high in the stands at Scotiabank Arena last Thursday watching the Tampa Bay Lightning practice ahead of a game against the Maple Leafs.
“They remind me of the Dallas Cowboys in their heyday,” said Burke, who won a Stanley Cup as general manager of the Anaheim Ducks in 2007. “No weaknesses and a lot of star power.”
Tampa Bay went on to beat Toronto that night, 3-1, and two days later, closed out the Boston Bruins, 6-3, for its record-tying 62nd win this season.
With a 62-16-4 record, the Lightning tied the 1995-96 Red Wings for the most wins in a season. And Tampa Bay, with 128 points, fell just short of one huge benchmark — the record 132 points achieved by the 1976-77 Montreal Canadiens (60-8-12), who were regarded as one of the best, if not the best, N.H.L. teams ever.
Tampa Bay finished with 12 more wins, and 21 more points, than the next closest team, the Calgary Flames. The Lightning did not lose more than two consecutive games all season.
But winning the Presidents’ Trophy as the best regular-season team is far from a guarantee of postseason success. The 1976-77 Canadiens won the Stanley Cup; the 1995-96 Red Wings did not.
On the 32 previous occasions that the Presidents’ Trophy has been awarded, only eight regular-season champions, or 25 percent, followed up with Stanley Cup titles. The last one was the Chicago Blackhawks in 2012-13.
The Lightning begin their first-round playoff series against the Columbus Blue Jackets on Wednesday well aware that history may regard them as a bust — or not regard them at all — if they don’t win a championship.
Eastern Conference
Tampa Bay Lightning vs. Columbus Blue Jackets
Boston Bruins vs. Toronto Maple Leafs

San Jose Sharks vs. Vegas Golden Knights
[
Complete first-round schedule
.]
The division-based playoff format, introduced for the 2013-14 season, does not help the Lightning’s cause.
Tampa Bay and Boston both play in the Atlantic Division and were the top two teams in the Eastern Conference. But one of them won’t get past the second round.
Lightning Coach Jon Cooper understands that success is often built on failure. Sometimes repeated failure. Under his tutelage, Tampa Bay advanced to three conference finals in the last four years and reached the Stanley Cup finals in 2015.
A dozen or so players are left from that 2014-15 team, which
lost to the Blackhawks in six games
. Back then, Cooper said, he struggled to stay positive as he exchanged handshakes with the winners.
In the handshake lineup was Scotty Bowman, a nine-time Stanley Cup winner as a coach and Chicago’s senior adviser of hockey operations.
Cooper will never forget what Bowman told him.
“You’ll be back soon,” said Bowman, who happens to have been the coach of the 1976-77 Canadiens and the 1995-96 Red Wings. “Don’t worry about it. I lost my first 12 Stanley Cup finals games.”
The Lightning lost the Eastern Conference finals in seven games the next year. Then last season Tampa Bay — already loaded with superstar talent in forwards Steven Stamkos and Nikita Kucherov, goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy and defenseman Victor Hedman — added what it thought were the final two pieces by acquiring defenseman Ryan McDonagh and forward J.T. Miller
from the Rangers at the trade deadline
.
But the Lightning lost to the Washington Capitals in the Eastern Conference finals in seven games.
In their first full season in Tampa Bay, McDonagh has had a resurgent season, ranking No. 2 in the league with a plus-38 rating, and Miller tallied 47 points.
“This is the effect you’re getting,” Cooper said. “A year later, when everybody is more comfortable, and they know what grocery store to go to, now they’re here just to play hockey. There are no other distractions, and we’re reaping the benefits of last year’s trade deadline.”
Other off-season adjustments have paid dividends.
Tampa Bay has No. 1-ranked power play and penalty killing units, but last season the Lightning were ranked 28th out of 31 teams in penalty killing efficiency.
Rick Bowness, who oversaw the defensive unit, was let go along with assistant coach Brad Lauer. Derek Lalonde was hired with Jeff Halpern to work with the forwards, and Todd Richards was hired to focus on the defense.
During a nine-game stretch in November, the Lightning gave up 13 power-play goals. Richards called a players meeting. The players took ownership of the problems and became more attentive to the “habit reminders” the coaches like to drill into them, like finishing their checks.
“It takes away holes in your game when you’re constantly doing things correctly,” Lalonde said.
Cooper saw signs that Kucherov, 25, was filling holes in his game this off-season, when he stayed in the Tampa area and rented a rink by himself so he could skate five days a week.
“His hockey mind is so elite and the physical side is catching up,” Cooper said.
Kucherov finished with 128 points, the most for a Russian player in N.H.L. history and the most for a league scoring champion since Mario Lemieux’s 161 in the 1995-96 season. He is the favorite to win the Hart Trophy as the league’s most valuable player.
Kucherov’s emergence has taken the pressure off Stamkos, 29, to be the dominant star. Stamkos responded by surpassing the 40-goal mark for the first time since 2014-15, and he hit a career high with 98 points. Kucherov, who is sneaky quick with the puck and makes good reads, also helped center Brayden Point score a career-high 41 goals.
Leading them all is Cooper, 51. Bowman, who follows the Lightning closely from his home in Sarasota, Fla., traces the team’s success to 2011-12, when Cooper showed an ability to put teams on a roll and keep them there.
He led the Norfolk Admirals, the Lightning’s American Hockey League affiliate at the time, to a record 28-game winning streak that culminated in a Calder Cup championship.
In March 2013, the Lightning promoted Cooper,
who was a public defender
in Michigan before making coaching his career. He has perfected the art of persuasion and negotiation with his players.
“He just has that balance in today’s N.H.L.,” said Lalonde, one of Cooper’s assistants. “He can be hard on players, but he cares about them too. The guys know he has their back.”
Cooper has claimed championships in the A.H.L. and in three junior hockey leagues. A Silver Cup. A Robertson Cup. A Clark Cup. A Calder Cup.
The Stanley Cup has eluded him, but this year, just maybe, it could be Cooper’s turn.

Juan Soto hit a three-run home run off Jose Alvarez in the top of the 10th inning to rally the visiting Washington Nationals to a 10-6 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on Tuesday.
Victor Robles, who had three hits, tied the score with a solo homer in the ninth, and Yan Gomes and Howie Kendrick also homered for the Nationals. Anthony Rendon had two hits and two RBIs, and Gomes added two hits.
Nationals starter Stephen Strasburg lasted only four innings and gave up six hits and six runs while walking four and striking out three. Sean Doolittle (3-0) picked up the win in relief.
Bryce Harper and Maikel Franco homered while J.T. Realmuto added three hits for the Phillies, who couldn't hold a 6-1 lead.
Mariners 6, Royals 3
Dee Gordon had three hits and two RBIs as Seattle claimed a victory at Kansas City. The Mariners extended baseball's best record to 11-2 with their fourth straight win.
Whit Merrifield continues to be the lone bright spot for the Royals, who lost their eighth game in a row. He led off the bottom of the first with a triple to extend his hitting streak to 30 games, dating back to last season.
The streak is tied for the longest in Royals history with Hall of Famer George Brett's run from in 1980, the year he hit .390. Merrifield finished 2-for-5.
Angels 11, Brewers 8
Tommy La Stella hit two home runs, but it was a bases-loaded walk by Jonathan Lucroy that drove in the winning run in Los Angeles' victory over Milwaukee Brewers.
The Angels earned their fifth win in a row, though it wasn't easy. Los Angeles blew a 6-0 first-inning lead and then lost Mike Trout for the game after the third inning because of a strained right groin. The two-time American League MVP is day-to-day.
The Brewers, thanks in large part to two homers by Yasmani Grandal, rallied to take an 8-7 lead in the fifth before the Angels' bullpen got stingy and the offense rallied to put Los Angeles in position to sweep the series Wednesday.
Diamondbacks 5, Rangers 4
Pinch hitter Jarrod Dyson hit a two-run homer in the bottom of the ninth inning as Arizona walked off with a victory over Texas in Phoenix.
With one out, Dyson pulled a 2-2 off-speed pitch from closer Jose Leclerc (1-1) over the fence in right field.
Arizona's Christian Walker singled to left to lead off the ninth against Leclerc and scored to make it 4-3 when Eduardo Escobar followed with a double to the wall in right-center field. Leclerc struck out Nick Ahmed before Dyson pinch-hit for John Ryan Murphy.
Rays 10, White Sox 5
Austin Meadows had a career-high four hits, including a two-run home run, and drove in four runs, and visiting Tampa Bay continued to match its best start in team history with a win against Chicago.
Avisail Garcia had three hits and Brandon Lowe had two, each hitting solo home runs for the Rays, who improved to 9-3 while clinching their fourth consecutive series to start the season.
Rays starter Charlie Morton (2-0) went five innings, allowing two runs, three hits, striking out seven and walking three.
Giants 7, Padres 2
Kevin Pillar cleared the bases with a three-run double to highlight a six-run second inning that sent San Francisco on its way to a victory over visiting San Diego.
Derek Holland (1-1) allowed just one run in seven innings, helping the Giants beat the Padres for just the second time in six meetings this season.
Hunter Renfroe hit his fourth homer for the Padres.
Braves 7, Rockies 1
Ronald Acuna homered for the second straight game, Dansby Swanson also went deep, and Atlanta beat Colorado in Denver.
Max Fried (2-0) gave up five hits and one unearned run over six innings to lead the Braves to their second straight win in the series.
German Marquez (1-1) was rocked for five runs in five innings, and Ian Desmond had an RBI single for Colorado, which has lost its first five home games this season.
Twins 14, Mets 8
Mitch Garver hit two home runs and tied a career high with four hits, and Jorge Polanco finished a double shy of his second cycle of the season as visiting Minnesota took advantage of a rare hiccup by Jacob deGrom in a win over New York.
The Twins have alternated wins with losses in their last five games. The Mets have dropped two straight and three of four. Polanco and Garver helped the Twins end two historic streaks by deGrom (2-1), who gave up six runs on eight hits and one walk while striking out three over four innings.
DeGrom entered Tuesday having given up three runs or fewer in each of his previous 31 starts, the longest such streak in major league history, and having produced a quality start 26 straight times, tying the record set by Bob Gibson in 1967-68.
Athletics 13, Orioles 2
Jurickson Profar homered on a four-hit, five-RBI night, and Marcus Semien homered and knocked in four as visiting Oakland defeated Baltimore.
Profar ended the night 4-for-5 with a solo homer, three singles and three runs. He drove in four runs in the final three innings as Oakland snapped a four-game losing streak.
Semien finished 1-for-4 and added a sacrifice fly in addition to an early three-run homer.
Astros 6, Yankees 3
George Springer roped a two-run double to left field in the eighth inning, and host Houston rallied against the New York bullpen for a second consecutive night.
Springer drilled a 1-1 fastball from Yankees right-hander Chad Green (0-2) into the left field corner, scoring Yuli Gurriel and Robinson Chirinos to snap a 3-3 tie.
The eighth-inning rally did come at a cost, however, as Bregman left the game with a tweaked right hamstring. After the game, Bregman said he hopes to miss only the Wednesday game.
Reds 14, Marlins 0
Starter Luis Castillo fired seven scoreless innings, the heart of the order hit three consecutive homers in a seven-run sixth inning, and host Cincinnati won for the first time since Opening Day by clobbering Miami. The result snapped the Reds' eight-game losing streak.
Up 4-0, Cincinnati blew open the first meeting between the two teams in the home half of the sixth as Jesse Winker had an RBI single off reliever Wei-Yin Chen, and a fielding error plated another run.
Matt Kemp later clubbed an opposite-field three-run homer, Eugenio Suarez golfed a solo shot, and Scott Schebler homered in the next at-bat for an 11-0 lead.
Cardinals 4, Dodgers 0
Paul Goldschmidt hit a home run, and Yadier Molina added a pair of run-scoring doubles as St. Louis moved over .500 for the first time this season with a victory over visiting Los Angeles.
Cardinals starter Dakota Hudson only lasted 4 2/3 innings after throwing 100 pitches, but the bullpen took it from there as John Brebbia (1-0), John Gant, Mike Mayers, Andrew Miller and Dominic Leone finished off the shutout.
Enrique Hernandez and Cody Bellinger had two hits each for the Dodgers, who were held without a home run for the second consecutive game after going deep in their first 10 games this season and 14 consecutive going back to last season. The Dodgers lost consecutive games for the first time.
Blue Jays 7, Red Sox 5
Matt Shoemaker pitched into the sixth inning to earn his third straight win, Lourdes Gurriel Jr. hit an RBI single and stole home, and visiting Toronto defeated Boston on the day the Red Sox unfurled their 2018 world championship banner at Fenway Park.
Boston left-hander Chris Sale (0-3) continued to struggle, allowing seven hits and five runs while striking out three in four innings.
Shoemaker (3-0) gave up five hits, two walks and four runs (two earned) and added four strikeouts as the Blue Jays ended a four-game losing streak.
Indians 8, Tigers 2
Brad Miller smacked one of four Cleveland home runs, scored three runs and knocked in two as the Indians stretched their winning streak to five games by cooling off host Detroit.
Ex-Tiger Leonys Martin, Jake Bauers and Roberto Perez added solo homers for Cleveland. Corey Kluber (1-2) gave up two runs (one earned) on seven hits in six innings while striking out eight.
Miguel Cabrera had two hits and an RBI for the Tigers, who had their five-game winning streak snapped. Jordan Zimmermann (0-1) surrendered up five runs (four earned) and four hits in 4 1/3 innings while serving up three of the homers.

TAMPA, Fla. — The Columbus Blue Jackets rebounded from a dismal start to stun the team that had the NHL's best regular-season record.
Seth Jones scored the go-ahead goal on the power play to cap Columbus' three-goal third period, and the Blue Jackets rallied to beat the Tampa Bay Lightning 4-3 in Game 1 of the teams' first-round Eastern Conference playoff series Wednesday night.
""We can't get comfortable,"" Jones said. ""Nothing is going to get easier. It's only going to get harder.""
Jones made it 4-3 from the slot with 5:55 to play as the Blues Jackets erased a 3-0 deficit after the Lightning scored three times in the opening period.
With Columbus trailing 3-1 in the third, David Savard deked around Lightning defenseman Victor Hedman and scored 7:56 into the period to make it a one-goal game. Josh Anderson picked up a short-handed goal that tied it at 3 at 11:54.
The Blue Jackets became the 27th NHL team to overcome at least a three-goal deficit to win a playoff game in regulation.
Nick Foligno had the other goal for Columbus, and Sergei Bobrovsky ended up with 26 saves after struggling in the first period.
The Lightning, who matched the 1995-96 Detroit Red Wings for the most wins in a regular season with 62, got first-period goals from Alex Killorn, Anthony Cirelli and Yanni Gourde. Andrei Vasilevskiy stopped 22 shots.
""Our mentality was, we wanted to outscore them tonight instead of build a lead and then shut then down,"" Lightning coach Jon Cooper said. ""Our mentality has to be when we get in these situations is shut teams down, not to add to the lead.""
Tampa Bay scored 325 goals in 2018-19, the most by any team in 23 years.
Hedman returned after missing the final four regular-season game with an upper-body injury. The Norris Trophy winner took a helmet to the face during a collision with Washington's Carl Hagelin on March 30.
Killorn stole the puck from Jones at the blue line during a power play for Columbus and put a backhander past Bobrovsky to open the scoring 4:12 into the game. Tampa Bay was tied for third in short-handed goals during the regular season with 12.
After Cirelli had a rebound goal at 11:01, Gourde's waist-high deflection of Mikhail Sergachev's shot made it 3-0 with 2:10 left in the first.
""We're just losing too many battles,"" Blue Jackets coach John Tortorella said of his first-intermission message. ""Just the grind of the game. We have to be able to grind with them.""
Foligno cut the deficit to 3-1 at 9:15 of the second on a breakaway goal after Tampa Bay's Ryan McDonagh made an errant pass in the offensive zone.
Alexandre Texier, Columbus' 19-year-old rookie who played in the Blue Jackets' final two regular-season games, skated in alone on Vasilevskiy but missed the net on a shot with 4 minutes to go in the first.
Bobrovsky stopped four shots over the final 40 seconds of the second, including a nifty glove save on Steven Stamkos.
""We don't have a chance if he doesn't play the way he played through the second and the third,"" Tortorella said of Bobrovsky.
Nikita Kucherov, who had an NHL-best 128 points in the regular season, was held without a point but had an in-close chance turned aside by Bobrovsky and hit the crossbar during the opening minute of the second during a power play.
""I don't know if it's a wake-up call, but we know it's a tough league to win in and we want to be better when we're up 3-0,"" Hedman said.
NOTES: Tampa Bay outscored Columbus 17-3 in sweeping all three games between the teams in the regular season. ... Lightning D Anton Stralman sat out with a lower-body injury, but might return during the series. ... RW Ryan Callahan and D Braydon Coburn were among Tampa Bay's healthy scratches. ... Columbus D Adam McQuaid (upper-body injury) didn't play.
QUOTABLE
""You can go through all the numbers, all the things, them against us, but when you play a 60-minute hockey game and you go through the momentum swings and the surges and maybe the big plays out of someone unexpected or a lousy play from someone unexpected, that changes games. So, that's why it's always up for grabs."" — Tortorella before the game on the unpredictability of playoff hockey.
UP NEXT
The Lightning will host Game 2 on Friday night.

SAN FRANCISCO — Brandon Belt homered and drove in three before an unusually small home crowd, and the San Francisco Giants beat the Tampa Bay Rays 6-4 on Saturday.
Steven Duggar had three RBIs and Joe Panik scored twice to help San Francisco snap a three-game losing streak behind a breakout day from its offense.
Belt had an RBI single in the third and hit a two-run, opposite-field home run off Ryan Yarbrough (1-1) as part of a four-run fifth.
Ji-Man Choi had two hits and two RBIs for Tampa Bay. Tommy Pham walked in the first inning to extend his on-base streak to 41 games, an ongoing franchise record dating to last season.
The Rays entered the day 6-2, their best start in club history, but couldn't hold an early lead.
The game drew 31,828, the smallest at Oracle Park since Sept. 1, 2010. The Giants set an NL record with 530 consecutive sellouts at their waterfront ballpark from 2010-17.
The fans who did show up witnessed the Giants set a season high for scoring after being limited to five runs in the previous 18 innings.
Belt and Duggar combined to drive in all six runs for San Francisco, but the Giants also got a lift from the bottom third of the order. Kevin Pillar, the No. 7 hitter, singled and scored in the third, Panik walked twice and scored both times, and Connor Joe had a pinch-hit single as part of the four-run fifth.
Travis Bergen (1-0) retired one batter in relief of starter Jeff Samardzija to earn his first career victory. Will Smith pitched the ninth for his third save.
Yarbrough allowed four runs in three innings.
Tampa Bay used reliever Ryne Stanek as the opener. Stanek, who also started Monday against Colorado, retired all six batters he faced.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Rays: Manager Kevin Cash had hoped to give slumping SS Willy Adames the day off. Instead, Adames singled and scored as a pinch-hitter in the fifth and singled in the ninth. Adames entered the day 1 for 27.
UP NEXT
LHP Drew Pomeranz (0-0, 3.60) pitches for San Francisco in the series finale Sunday at Oracle Park. Pomeranz went winless in two games last season. Cash has yet to announce who will pitch for Tampa Bay.

AUGUSTA, Ga. — Ed Sneed sat on a sofa in Butler Cabin at Augusta National looking as though he didn't know what hit him.
He had a three-shot lead with three holes to play in the 1979 Masters and didn't do anything horribly wrong, except nothing went right. He finished with three straight bogeys and faced a sudden-death playoff with Fuzzy Zoeller and Tom Watson, which Zoeller won with a birdie on the second extra hole at No. 11.
Arnold Palmer was conducting the interview in Butler Cabin and sympathized. So did Watson, who was sitting next to Sneed. Watson had lost in a three-way playoff the previous major at the PGA Championship, which cost him the career Grand Slam.
""I know what it feels like to be in that position,"" Watson said. ""All the condolences in the world wouldn't fix what the hurt is right now inside of him. He'll have plenty of tournaments left. He's a great player. He showed it this week.""
There were other tournaments, sure, but Sneed played the Masters only three more times.
He never got another chance.
The hurt never really goes away.
""It's something that sticks with you,"" Sneed said from his home in Ohio. ""I never won many tour events, but I'm remembered more for losing that one.""
At the Masters, he's not alone.
The fabled green jacket is almost close enough to feel it slipped over the shoulders, and then it's gone. And for some, the opportunity never returns.
Scott Hoch missed a 3-foot putt in a playoff in 1989 and lost to Nick Faldo on the next hole. Hoch at least had another chance six years later when he went into the final round one shot out of the lead, shot 73 and tied for fifth.
Greg Norman is not the most frequent runner-up at the Masters, just the most famous. He had more than one opportunity.
Not so for Chad Campbell in 2009, the first man out in a three-man playoff won by Angel Cabrera.
""It was early enough in my career, I felt like I was going to have a lot more opportunities to have a chance to win,"" said Campbell, missing the Masters this year for the ninth straight year.
Not for Len Mattiace in 2003, who lost in a playoff to Mike Weir.
""It hurt that night,"" Mattiace said. ""I played Hilton Head the next week and it hurt the same. It didn't really change ever.""
Sneed won four times on the PGA Tour — oddly enough, three were in a playoff — and he was right that he is known more for the one playoff he lost. For about a dozen years after that Masters, he could count on someone calling and wanting to talk about that shocking finish.
""I've replayed that many, many times in my mind,"" Sneed said. ""Actually, it's the only place you can replay it because you can't go back there.""
Mattiace's only chance was in 2003, right after Augusta National had super-sized the golf course. Even with a bogey on the 18th hole, Mattiace shot a 65 in the final round and was on the verge of winning until Weir finished with two tough par putts.
The playoff effectively ended in one shot. Mattiace went first at the par-4 10th and tugged it left, stymied by a tree. He chipped through the green, and his par putt ran to the fringe. He missed that one, too, taking double bogey.
""I tried to keep perspective,"" Mattiace said. ""I had a great tournament. I shot 65. Everything was great. But when you get in that position, you want to cap it off and get a W. So I keep that perspective. But it hurts just the same.""
Later that year, Mattiace tore knee ligaments while skiing and when he returned to the Masters, he could barely walk and missed the cut.
That turned out to be his last Masters.
Campbell never expected to be in a playoff in 2009 until Kenny Perry bogeyed his last two holes. Suddenly, Campbell had the advantage. Perry had come up short of the 18th green. Cabrera was in the trees and hit another tree trying to get out. He managed to save par.
""I drove it perfect, just up the right side and had 162 yards,"" Campbell said. ""It set up perfect for me. I'd like to have that one back.""
He put it into a bunker, blasted out to 5 feet and missed the par putt. Cabrera won on the next hole.
Campbell returned to Augusta National the next year, with no reason to believe that would be his last year. He doesn't let much in life linger. If anything causes him to think back, it's the Masters.
""The longer it goes, you look back and feel like it's the one that got away,"" he said.
Chris DiMarco played in the final group two straight years at the Masters. He had faded long before Phil Mickelson made his 18-foot putt to win his first major in 2004. There was no fading against Tiger Woods in 2005. DiMarco pushed all day until Woods made birdie on the first playoff hole.
""I've never gotten more notoriety than finishing second in a major,"" DiMarco said.
It was what he said that afternoon at Augusta that was so telling: ""I will be ready to win next year.""
But he fell while skiing and injured his back on a bottle that was in his backpack and wasn't quite the same. He played the Masters twice more and missed the cut.
And he never made it back.

ST. LOUIS — Austin Hedges and Manny Machado each hit a two-run homer off Andrew Miller in the eighth inning, helping the San Diego Padres beat the St. Louis Cardinals 6-4 on Saturday for their third consecutive win.
Fernando Tatis Jr. opened the eighth with a walk and Hedges followed with a go-ahead drive over the wall on in left. With two out and Ian Kinsler on first after a walk, Machado made it 6-3 with his second homer of the season.
It was the first time that Miller (0-1) allowed multiple homers in a game since Sept. 22, 2015 for the New York Yankees at Toronto.
Matt Wisler (1-0) pitched two scoreless innings for the win in his first outing with the Padres. Kirby Yates worked the ninth for his fifth save in five chances.

MADRID — Into the final of the Copa del Rey and with a comfortable 11-point lead at the top of La Liga, Barca coach Ernesto Valverde is expected to give a number of fringe players a chance when they visit bottom side Huesca on Saturday.
Treble-chasing Barca, who hold a 1-0 lead going into the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final against Man United next Tuesday, are comfortably ahead of second-placed Atletico Madrid, while great rivals Real sit 13 points behind the Catalans with just seven games to go.
The coach is almost certain to leave out Lionel Messi, whose nose was left bloodied and bruised by a robust challenge against United. ""He’s got a significant bruise and we'll have to see what the scans say,"" Valverde explained.
Barcelona's Brazilian duo Philippe Coutinho and Malcom will be particularly keen to impress. Coutinho, who joined Barcelona last January for a club record 142 million pounds from Liverpool, has flattered to deceive in Catalonia, unable to nail down a regular starting berth and was taken off after another anonymous hour in Wednesday's Champions League victory.
Malcom, meanwhile, has made just two La Liga starts this season and will look to use the opportunity to force his way into Valverde's plans for the tail end of the season.
""We'll see how everyone is, but there's not a lot of turnaround so it's quite possible we'll make changes for Saturday,"" Valverde told a news conference.
Atletico will be without Diego Costa for the rest of the season after his red card at Barcelona. The Spain international has been given an eight-game ban after he was accused of swearing at referee Jesus Gil Manzano before grabbing his arm and refusing to leave the field of play.
They host strugglers Celta Vigo this weekend and coach Diego Simeone insists they will still give their all until the end of the campaign.
""The season is nowhere near over,"" he said.
""I'll evaluate it with the fact we won the European Super Cup, that we are fighting it out for second place in the league once again. If that's seen as a poor season, then happy days.""
Celta sit two points outside the relegation zone, however their striker Iago Aspas has netted five goals in his last three appearances.
Elsewhere, Real visit fellow Madrid outfit Leganes on Monday night looking to keep up the pressure on Atleti in second, while Seville host Real Betis in what is always a feisty city derby on Saturday evening.

MADRID — Atletico Madrid striker Diego Costa has been handed an eight-match La Liga ban by the Spanish Football Federation’s Competition Committee for abusing the referee after he was shown the red card during last Sunday’s 2-0 defeat by Barcelona.
The official's report stated the 30-year-old swore and shouted at referee Jesus Gil Manzano and also grabbed him “on numerous occasions” after he had been given his marching orders in the 28th minute.
The ban, which ends Costa’s season as there are only seven games remaining, consists of four games for being found in breach of Article 94 of the league’s code of conduct for using insulting or offensive words towards a match official, and four matches for breaching Article 96, which refers to the use of light violence towards referees.
Atletico were fined 2800 euros (2,413.70 pounds), while Costa 6010 euros over the incident. They have 10 days in which they can lodge an appeal.

The Atlanta Falcons have signed veteran defensive end Adrian Clayborn to a one-year deal, the team announced Tuesday.
Official terms were not disclosed, but multiple outlets reported that he could earn up to $4 million with incentives.
Clayborn, who played for the Falcons from 2015-17, appeared in 14 games for the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots last season and tallied 2.5 sacks.
""I'm excited to be back and help this defense and team anyway I can,"" he told NFL Network. ""It's familiar here and I know I fit into the defense well. At this point that's what's most important.""
Clayborn, 30, has registered 32.5 career sacks and 90 quarterback hits in 95 games (51 starts) with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Falcons and Patriots.
On Nov. 12, 2017, the former first-round pick (20th overall in 2011) set a Falcons record with six sacks in a 27-7 victory against the Dallas Cowboys.

HANOVER, N.H. — Penn and Dartmouth have completed the longest game in Ivy League history, with the Quakers using an eight-run 21st inning to beat the Big Green 21-15 Saturday.
The game lasted 6 hours, 22 minutes. Penn's Josh Hood hit a three-run homer in his 11th plate appearance, keying the 21st-inning rally.
Craig Larsen hit a grand slam in the eighth and became the first Penn player to hit for the cycle in 19 years. The freshman had five of the team's program-record 30 hits.
Penn catcher Matt O'Neill played all 21 innings, squatting for 358 pitches. He was 3 for 6 with four RBIs and a Quaker-record five walks.
Dartmouth twice rallied from three runs down to keep the game going, first in the ninth inning and again in the 13th. Neither team scored from then until the 21st. Quakers right-hander Josh Sidney pitched three-hit ball over six scoreless relief innings before Joe Miller took over and got the win.
The teams had planned to play a doubleheader. The late game was rescheduled as part of a doubleheader Sunday.

ORLANDO, Fla. — Nani converted a late penalty and finished with two goals and one assist on Saturday night to help Orlando City beat the Colorado Rapids 4-3.
Rapids goalkeeper Tim Howard guessed the wrong way and Nani finished into the right corner to cap the scoring in the 89th minute. The Rapids' Axel Sjoberg conceded the penalty with a hand ball in the area.
Chris Mueller tied it at 3 in the 81st minute for Orlando City (2-2-2), settling a pass from Tesho Akindele and finishing with his left foot into the right corner.
Kei Kamara gave Colorado a 1-0 lead in the ninth minute, slotting a half volley home for his 115th MLS goal, moving him past Ante Razov for fifth place on the all-time goals list.
Nani answered in the 31st minute with his first MLS goal and Akindele made it 2-1 for Orlando City two minutes later.
Nicolas Mezquida scored in the 61st minute and Cole Bassett added another in the 71st to give the Rapids (0-4-2) a 3-2 lead.
The match was delayed an hour at halftime due to inclement weather.

MILAN — Teenager Moise Kean has left Juventus within one win of retaining its Serie A title.
Kean, who was the victim of racist abuse during the week, scored what was to prove the winner on Saturday as Juventus came from behind to beat AC Milan 2-1.
It was the Italy forward's fifth goal in as many matches for club and country.
Paulo Dybala's penalty had canceled out Krzysztof Piatek's opener for Milan.
Juventus moved 21 points clear of second-placed Napoli which hosts Genoa on Sunday. There are seven matches remaining after this weekend and Juventus holds the tiebreaker with a better head-to-head record against Napoli.
Defeat for Napoli on Sunday would hand Juventus the title this weekend. Even if Napoli wins, the Bianconeri would clinch a record-extending eighth successive Serie A crown with victory at Spal next Saturday.
Milan dropped valuable points in the race for fourth spot and the final Champions League qualifying berth, which it currently occupies. The Rossoneri remained one point above Atalanta, which visits third-placed Inter Milan on Sunday.
Juventus had a poor first half and could even have given away a penalty. After viewing the incident on the pitchside monitor, the referee decided Alex Sandro's handball was involuntary.
Milan took the lead moments later anyway as a pass by Leonardo Bonucci, who spent last year with the Rossoneri, was intercepted by Tiemoue Bakayoko and he threaded it through for Piatek.
It was Piatek's 21st league goal this season, for Genoa and Milan, and moved him level at the top of the goalscoring charts with Sampdoria forward Fabio Quagliarella. Sampdoria was playing Roma later.
Juventus appeared more determined after the break and leveled from the spot on the hour after Mateo Musacchio barged over Dybala in the area.
Musacchio made up for his error with a goal-saving tackle on Mario Mandzukic but Juventus did get the winner when Miralem Pjanic intercepted Davide Calabria's pass and set up Kean, who slotted it into the far bottom corner.
There was to be no discussion about Kean's celebration this time around, in front of his own fans.
Kean scored his team's second goal in the 2-0 victory at Cagliari on Tuesday and stood in front of the home fans with his arms outstretched, having been insulted by them all match. That was followed by a furious and openly racist response from some fans.
Bonucci claimed teammate Kean was partly to blame for the response, prompting other European players to rush to the 19-year-old's defense.

PHILADELPHIA — Jordan Staal scored the go-ahead goal in the second period and the Carolina Hurricanes hung on to beat the Philadelphia Flyers 4-3 on Saturday night for their fourth victory in five games.
The Hurricanes finished in the top wild-card spot in the Eastern Conference and will play the defending Stanley Cup champion Washington Capitals in the opening round of the playoffs.
Warren Foegele, Justin Faulk and Teuvo Teravainen all scored in the first period for the Hurricanes, who clinched their first postseason berth Thursday night with a win over New Jersey.
Carolina also set a franchise record with its 22nd road win this season. The Hurricanes went 31-12-2 over their last 45 games, placing them among the top three in the league since the calendar turned to 2019.
Oskar Lindblom, Travis Konecny and Sean Couturier had goal for the Flyers, who missed the playoffs.
The Flyers had a lineup with seven defensemen instead of the standard six — but they still struggled to keep the puck out of the net. Foegele and Faulk were each the beneficiaries of negligent defensive zone coverage from Philadelphia and scored goals separated by 2 minutes, 29 seconds when loose pucks found their sticks in the middle of the ice.
It was the fourth consecutive game the Flyers trailed 2-0.
Lindblom beat Curtis McElhinney to cut the deficit to 2-1 late in the first period. But Teravainen tallied his 21st when, relatively untouched, he took a pass in the slot from Staal and beat Carter Hart with a wrist shot.
Philadelphia got goals from Konecny and Couturier in the first 6:07 of the second period to tie the game.
But Staal quickly put the Hurricanes up again — and to stay — when he beat Hart from the slot at 7:33
McElhinney stopped all 10 of the Flyers' shots in the third period and finished with 28 saves overall.
The Hurricanes registered just one shot on goal in the third period.
NOTES: Carolina beat Philadelphia for the fourth time this season. It's the first time the Flyers failed to earn a point in a season series vs. the Hurricanes. ... Carolina coach Rod Brind'Amour recorded the most wins (46) and points (99) by any Hurricanes or Hartford Whalers coach in their first season behind the bench. ... Philadelphia finished the season as the league's top faceoff team. The Flyers entered Saturday winning nearly 55 percent of their faceoffs.

ST. LOUIS — Jordan Binnington stopped both shots he faced in the shootout, and the St. Louis Blues remained in the hunt for the Central Division title with a 3-2 win over the Vancouver Canucks on Saturday.
The 25-year-old Binnington finished with 23 saves and closed out his breakthrough season with a 24-5-1 record.
Vladimir Tarasenko and Brayden Schenn scored in regulation for the Blues, and Ryan O'Reilly and David Perron converted their attempts in the tiebreaker.
St. Louis (45-28-9) moved into first place in the Central with 99 points, one more than Nashville and Winnipeg. The Predators host the Chicago Blackhawks and the Jets visit Arizona on Saturday night.
Elias Pettersson and Tanner Pearson scored for Vancouver (35-36-11). Pettersson tied the game with a power-play goal with 2:09 left in regulation.
Demko made 34 saves for the Canucks, who missed the playoffs for the fourth season in a row.
Vancouver trailed 1-0 before Pearson scored his 18th goal 3:53 into the third. Demko picked up his first assist of the season on the play.
Tarasenko then got his 33rd goal when he drove a wrist shot past Demko with 9:31 left.
Tarasenko also set up Schenn's 17th goal with a cross-ice pass in the opening period. O'Reilly earned his 48th assist on the opening score and finished his first season with St. Louis with 76 points, the most for the Blues since Pavol Demitra had 93 in the 2002-2003 campaign.
The Blues are 38-19-6 under interim coach Craig Berube, who took over after Mike Yeo was fired in November.
St. Louis, which won a franchise-record 11 straight games from Jan. 23-Feb. 19, has recorded 65 points since Jan. 3 when it had a league-low 34 points.
NOTES: St. Louis C Tyler Bozak was involved in a auto accident heading to the game and did not play. ... The Blues have earned a point in 10 of their last 13 home games against Vancouver. ... St. Louis has outscored its opposition by a league-best 25 goals in the first period. ... St. Louis D Colton Parayko missed his second straight game with a mid-body injury.

BOSTON — The Tampa Bay Lightning won their NHL record-tying 62nd game, getting a shorthanded goal by Steven Stamkos during a three-goal second period in their 6-3 victory over the Boston Bruins on Saturday in the teams' regular-season finale.
Nikita Kucherov, Anthony Cirelli, Erik Cernak and Braydon Coburn also scored for Tampa Bay (62-16-4), which tied the 1995-96 Detroit Red Wings for most victories during the regular season.
Six of the wins, though, came in shootouts. The league introduced shootouts to decide ties after overtime at the start of the 2005-06 season. Before that, games ended in ties after overtime, which was brought in for regular-season games in 1983.
David Krejci, Danton Heinen and Matt Grzelcyk each had a goal for Boston (49-24-9), which fell one short of consecutive 50-win seasons since collecting four straight from 1970-71 through 1973-74. Tuukka Rask made 16 saves.
Kucherov will almost certainly win the Art Ross Trophy as the NHL's leading scorer with 128 points (41 goals, 87 assists) barring a record setting night Edmonton's Connor McDavid, who trails by 12 points.
Third-string goalie Edward Pasquale stopped 30 shots and Tyler Johnson added an empty-netter.
It was the Lightning's 30th road win, making them just the second team in league history to reach that total. The 2005-06 Red Wings had 31.
Both teams had a handful of players that were rested. Boston had a larger group that included top-line players Patrice Bergeron and Brad Marchand, who finished as the first Bruins player with 100 points in a regular season (36 goals, 64 assists) since Joe Thornton in 2002-03.
Trailing 2-1, Stamkos stole a pass and went in all alone, shifting around Rask before tucking a backhander into the net for an unassisted goal, tying it at 2 midway into the second. Cirelli's goal 4:07 later moved the Lightning ahead 3-2. Kucherov scored 53 seconds into the third.
Krejci's was credited with a goal 14:38 into the game that made it 1-0. Charlie McAvoy was originally given the goal after he collected a loose puck and fired it at the net as Krejci was charging toward the front.
Heinen beat Pasquale with a rising wrister inside the left post to make it 2-0 with 19.1 seconds left in the opening period. Cernak slipped a wrister past Rask from the slot for a power-play goal 4:41 into the second.
NOTES: Kucherov's goal gave him 127 points, tying Alexander Mogilny's mark set in 1992-93 for most by a Russian-born player. . Bruins defensemen Brandon Carlo, John Moore and Kevan Miller were out of the lineup along with forwards Chris Wagner and Noel Acciari. . Tampa Bay sat defensemen Victor Hedman, Anton Stralman and Mikhail Sergachev and forwards Cedric Paquette and Brayden Point. . Marchand won the Elizabeth Dufresne Trophy that's voted by the local chapter of the Professional Hockey Writers Association for the best performance during home games. . Boston's Charlie Coyle played his 500th NHL game.

CLEVELAND — LaMarcus Aldridge had 18 points and 13 rebounds as the San Antonio Spurs, who are in a three-team scramble to determine playoff seeding in the Western Conference, extended Cleveland's losing streak to nine games by beating the Cavaliers 112-90 on Sunday.
The Spurs recently clinched a postseason spot for a NBA record-tying 22nd year in a row, but they don't yet know who they'll play in the first round. San Antonio came into the day in eighth place, which would mean an early matchup with defending champion Golden State.
However, the Spurs can still move ahead of Oklahoma City and the Los Angeles Clippers as they own tiebreakers with both teams.
DeMar DeRozan and Patty Mills added 14 points apiece for the balanced Spurs, who turned back every Cleveland challenge in the second half. Mills made three 3-pointers in a two-minute span early in the fourth quarter to end any chances of the Cavs rallying.
Rookie Collin Sexton and Brandon Knight scored 16 each for Cleveland, and the Cavs celebrated the upcoming retirement of forward Channing Frye throughout the game.
Kevin Love returned after missing four games and played 13 minutes in the first half — a salute to Frye, his close friend.
San Antonio didn't pull away from Cleveland until midway through the second quarter and the Spurs used a 9-0 run over the final 2:05 to open a 62-46 halftime lead.
With the popular Frye retiring after Tuesday's game and 13 seasons, Cavs coach Larry Drew started the 35-year-old for the first time since Jan. 9.
Love wanted to play alongside Frye one last time and subbed in during the first quarter wearing his friend's No. 45 college jersey from the University of Arizona over his Cavaliers' jersey. The gesture couldn't have been easy for Love, who played at rival UCLA.
When Frye hit a 3-pointer for Cleveland's first points, the Cavs bench erupted and the reserves, who all wore shooting shirts with ""Channing"" on the back, celebrated with high-fives.
Frye, a key member of the Cavs' 2016 title team, played the first seven minutes and pretended to collapse on the bench when he finally came out.
When he was pulled with 1:34 left in the game, Frye received a loud ovation before being tackled to the floor by teammates.

NEW YORK — Rookie Pete Alonso and Robinson Cano hit back-to-back home runs to begin the eighth and Keon Broxton lined an RBI single later in the inning, lifting the New York Mets over the Washington Nationals 6-5 Saturday.
Unlikely cleanup man J.D. Davis hit two home runs and Michael Conforto also connected as the Mets improved to 6-2.
Anthony Rendon hit a leadoff homer and Wilmer Difo added a two-run shot in the top of the eighth, putting Washington ahead 5-3. Both drives came off reliever Jeurys Familia (2-0) — never before had he given up two home runs in a game.
But the Mets bounced right back, with Alonso and Cano tagging Justin Miller to make it 5-all.
Tony Sipp (0-1) took over with two outs and Conforto greeted him with a double. After pinch-hitter Jeff McNeil was plunked by a pitch, Broxton singled to complete the comeback.
Edwin Diaz worked the ninth for his fourth save.
A bizarre passed ball gave Washington a gift run in the seventh. With two outs and runners on first and second, pinch-hitter Matt Adams swung over a breaking ball from Familia.
But the pitch bounced under catcher Wilson Ramos, and he scrambled around the plate to find the ball. He couldn't locate it, and by the time Familia rushed in and retrieved it near the backstop, Victor Robles had streaked home from second to pull the Nationals within 3-2.
Davis delivered the first multihomer game of his brief career, lining solo drives off Patrick Corbin in the fourth inning and the sixth.
Acquired from Houston during the offseason in a minor deal, the 25-year-old Davis began the game with a career .189 batting average and five home runs.
Conforto also homered in the sixth. He's 6 for 14 with four homers lifetime against Corbin, a two-time All-Star who signed a $140 million, six-year deal to leave Arizona and join the Nationals.
Mets starter Steven Matz was pulled after five shutout innings of two-hit ball. He labored to get there, striking out eight, walking four and throwing 103 pitches.
Matz has gone eight straight starts without a win or loss — his no-decision streak is the longest in Mets history.
WELCOME BACK
Howie Kendrick flied out as a pinch-hitter in his first big league game for Washington since May 19, then stayed in to play second base. The 35-year-old INF/OF missed most of last season with a ruptured Achilles tendon and strained a hamstring in spring training.
NOT FINDING NIMMO
Mets leadoff man Brandon Nimmo struck out in all three at-bats. He's 2 for 26 this year, fanning 17 times.
DOZIER DROUGHT
Nats newcomer Brian Dozier went 0 for 3, leaving him 2 for 25 with nine strikeouts this season. He's hit over 20 home runs for five straight years, but batted a combined .215 for Minnesota and the Dodgers last season. Manager Dave Martinez said pregame that Dozier remains the everyday second baseman for now. Martinez noted Dozier had been fouling off too many pitches he needs to drive. Dozier fouled off three pitches his first time up before fanning.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Nationals: OF Michael A. Taylor (knee, hip) was set to play seven innings in the field for Double-A Harrisburg. There's no timetable for his return to the majors.
Mets: McNeil didn't start, resting his banged-up knee. It's been ailing him since he knocked into an outfield fence in spring training.
UP NEXT
Nationals: RHP Max Scherzer (0-2, 2.13 ERA) has lost both starts this year despite pitching well. He hasn't lost three straight starts since 2015, his first season in Washington.
Mets: RHP Zack Wheeler (0-0, 7.20) got a no-decision vs. Washington last weekend, giving up four earned run in five innings.

NEW YORK — Rookie Pete Alonso and Robinson Cano hit back-to-back home runs to begin the eighth and Keon Broxton lined an RBI single later in the inning, lifting the New York Mets over the Washington Nationals 6-5 Saturday.
Unlikely cleanup man J.D. Davis hit two home runs and Michael Conforto also connected as the Mets improved to 6-2.
Anthony Rendon hit a leadoff homer and Wilmer Difo added a two-run shot in the top of the eighth, putting Washington ahead 5-3. Both drives came off reliever Jeurys Familia (2-0) — never before had he given up two home runs in a game.
But the Mets bounced right back, with Alonso and Cano tagging Justin Miller to make it 5-all.
Tony Sipp (0-1) took over with two outs and Conforto greeted him with a double. After pinch-hitter Jeff McNeil was plunked by a pitch, Broxton singled to complete the comeback.
Edwin Diaz worked the ninth for his fourth save.
A bizarre passed ball gave Washington a gift run in the seventh. With two outs and runners on first and second, pinch-hitter Matt Adams swung over a breaking ball from Familia.
But the pitch bounced under catcher Wilson Ramos, and he scrambled around the plate to find the ball. He couldn't locate it, and by the time Familia rushed in and retrieved it near the backstop, Victor Robles had streaked home from second to pull the Nationals within 3-2.
Davis delivered the first multihomer game of his brief career, lining solo drives off Patrick Corbin in the fourth inning and the sixth.
Acquired from Houston during the offseason in a minor deal, the 25-year-old Davis began the game with a career .189 batting average and five home runs.
Conforto also homered in the sixth. He's 6 for 14 with four homers lifetime against Corbin, a two-time All-Star who signed a $140 million, six-year deal to leave Arizona and join the Nationals.
Mets starter Steven Matz was pulled after five shutout innings of two-hit ball. He labored to get there, striking out eight, walking four and throwing 103 pitches.
Matz has gone eight straight starts without a win or loss — his no-decision streak is the longest in Mets history.
WELCOME BACK
Howie Kendrick flied out as a pinch-hitter in his first big league game for Washington since May 19, then stayed in to play second base. The 35-year-old INF/OF missed most of last season with a ruptured Achilles tendon and strained a hamstring in spring training.
NOT FINDING NIMMO
Mets leadoff man Brandon Nimmo struck out in all three at-bats. He's 2 for 26 this year, fanning 17 times.
DOZIER DROUGHT
Nats newcomer Brian Dozier went 0 for 3, leaving him 2 for 25 with nine strikeouts this season. He's hit over 20 home runs for five straight years, but batted a combined .215 for Minnesota and the Dodgers last season. Manager Dave Martinez said pregame that Dozier remains the everyday second baseman for now. Martinez noted Dozier had been fouling off too many pitches he needs to drive. Dozier fouled off three pitches his first time up before fanning.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Nationals: OF Michael A. Taylor (knee, hip) was set to play seven innings in the field for Double-A Harrisburg. There's no timetable for his return to the majors.
Mets: McNeil didn't start, resting his banged-up knee. It's been ailing him since he knocked into an outfield fence in spring training.
UP NEXT
Nationals: RHP Max Scherzer (0-2, 2.13 ERA) has lost both starts this year despite pitching well. He hasn't lost three straight starts since 2015, his first season in Washington.
Mets: RHP Zack Wheeler (0-0, 7.20) got a no-decision vs. Washington last weekend, giving up four earned run in five innings.

DETROIT — Christin Stewart hit a two-out grand slam in the seventh inning, lifting the Detroit Tigers to a 7-4 victory over the Kansas City Royals on Saturday.
The Tigers trailed 4-2 in the seventh but rallied against Kansas City's struggling bullpen. Kevin McCarthy (0-1) allowed three hits and a hit batter. The only out on his watch came with the score 4-3, when Alex Gordon threw Josh Harrison out at the plate. Detroit eventually loaded the bases with two out, and Stewart hit a drive down the line in right field off Wily Peralta.
It was the second home run of the season for Detroit's rookie outfielder. Stewart's other one was also big — a 10th-inning shot at Toronto that provided all the scoring in a 2-0 victory in the season opener.
Whit Merrifield, Jorge Soler and Hunter Dozier all homered for the Royals, but Kansas City's bullpen — which entered the game with a 7.45 ERA — couldn't hold on.
Shane Greene pitched a perfect ninth and now has saves in all six Detroit victories this season — without blowing any. The Tigers have won four straight, and the Royals have dropped five in a row.
Tigers starter Matt Moore retired the first eight hitters he faced, but he left the game after three innings with a sprained right knee. Detroit led 2-0 in the sixth when Merrifield hit a solo shot, extending his hitting streak to 27 games. Kansas City then tied it in the seventh on a home run by Soler, and Dozier hit a two-run homer off Victor Alcantara (2-0) later that inning.
Nicholas Castellanos hit an RBI single in the seventh for the Tigers, and Miguel Cabrera followed with a single that could have loaded the bases with nobody out. Instead, third-base coach Dave Clark sent Harrison, who was thrown out at home. One out later, Jeimer Candelario drew a walk that loaded the bases for Stewart.
Merrifield's hitting streak, which dates to last season, is now tied for the second-longest in Royals' history. Jose Offerman had a 27-game streak in 1998, and George Brett had a 30-game run in 1980.
Royals first baseman Frank Schwindel, whose error in the second gave Detroit the game's first run, singled in the seventh for his first career hit.
Cabrera hit an RBI single in the fifth that put the Tigers up 2-0.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Tigers: OF JaCoby Jones (left shoulder) and RHP Drew VerHagen (right shoulder) started rehab assignments with Class A Lakeland on Friday night. Jones went 1 for 4 but struck out three times, which left Detroit manager Ron Gardenhire a bit bemused. ""Says, 'When am I getting out of this place?' You're in A ball, just struck out three times,"" Gardenhire said with a smile. ""When you get a couple hits, not strike out three times in A ball — that would be my answer.""
UP NEXT
Royals: RHP Brad Keller (1-0) takes the mound in the series finale Sunday. Because of off days, he'll be able to start for the third time in Kansas City's first eight games.
Tigers: RHP Tyson Ross (0-1) makes his first home start for Detroit after signing in the offseason.

SUNRISE, Fla. — The Florida Panthers have fired coach Bob Boughner, who led the team for the past two seasons and didn't get to the playoffs in either one.
The Panthers announced the move Sunday, one day after the team's season ended. Assistant coach Paul McFarland also was fired.
Panthers general manager Dale Tallon called it ""a tough decision"" and says the team needs a coach with a ""Stanley Cup pedigree.""
Florida missed the playoffs by one point in Boughner's first season. The Panthers missed the playoffs by 12 points this season, wasting a year when Aleksander Barkov set a club record with 96 points and the team had three 30-goal scorers.
Florida won 80 of its 164 games under Boughner's tenure. The Panthers have missed the playoffs 16 times in the last 18 seasons.

CALGARY, Alberta — Edmonton Oilers star Connor McDavid injured his left leg and left Saturday's season finale against the Calgary Flames after colliding with the net.
McDavid was helped off the ice by teammate Zack Kassian and a trainer after crashing into the Flames' net.
McDavid fell to the ice after being challenged by Flames defenseman Mark Giordano and then slid hard into the net.
McDavid held his left leg for several minutes before being helped off. There was no immediate word on the extent of the injury.
The 22-year-old McDavid is second in the league in scoring this season with 116 points.
The Oilers were eliminated from playoff contention earlier this week.

NEW YORK — The WNBA's logo is getting a new look and the league is resetting its brand for the upcoming season.
The league unveiled its plans Monday as it looks to embrace the optimism of the women across the WNBA in building the next generation of fans.
""We are excited about all of it,"" WNBA chief operating officer Christy Hedgpeth said by phone last week. ""It starts with our purpose, which is to expand our audience and grow at a faster rate.
""We believe we'll do that by becoming more and more culturally relevant over time. It led us to a new target consumer, new design target that's much, much younger — the 16-to-34 millennials, who are very diverse, very socially conscious, engaged in issues of today.""
The WNBA's 23rd season begins May 24, with the Seattle Storm the defending champion.
The league partnered with Sylvain Labs, an innovation and brand design consultancy last year, to learn more about its existing fans and potential new fans. They developed a long-term growth strategy and identify new marketing opportunities.
""We've engaged very, very closely throughout this process,"" Hedgpeth said. ""Six months working with Sylvain Labs to develop what the new brand will stand for.""
The two groups, along with player input, came up with the league's new logo.
""They took the silhouette out of the box which is a massive breakthrough as she was perceived totally different,"" Hedgpeth said. ""She was free, there was more movement there, taking up more space. She's more athletic, longer physique. This is basketball on our terms. That was a phrase that really resonated with the players. That's really symbolic in that regard.""
The new logo is different from others affiliated with the NBA.
""The NBA logo, there's a rectangle around him, he's in a box. Same with the G-League logo and the previous W-logo. She had a box around her,"" Hedgpeth said. ""The box is going away. It's powerful, it's freeing and it's expansive.""
It's the first time the league will have a new logo since 2013. While the new logo won't be on the uniforms or balls until next year because of the lack of production time needed to do it, it will be everywhere else around the league.
Hedgpeth insisted that the logo wasn't modeled after one player and that the hair was a huge part of the conversation. The logo has a bun which represents the way many players wear their hair.
The league also has a new marquee partner in AT&T.
""They are a perfect fit,"" Hedgpeth said. ""They have such a great fit to diversity and inclusion and accurately portraying women in advertising.""

A look at what's happening around the majors Sunday:
MIGHTY, MIGHTY MARINERS
Seattle has been swinging big in 2019, entering its series finale against the White Sox leading the majors with 24 homers. All that power has the Mariners off to an 8-2 start, best in club history. Jay Bruce went deep twice and Tim Beckham added a three-run shot in a 9-2 win Saturday over Chicago. Bruce leads the club with five homers, and Beckham and Domingo Santana are next with four each — all three of those players were added in the offseason, part of a rebuild by general manager Jerry Dipoto.
MILE HIGH SPOTLIGHT
Sunday Night Baseball on ESPN makes its first appearance at Coors Field since 2001 when Nolan Arenado and the Rockies host Justin Turner and the Los Angeles Dodgers, who beat Colorado in a one-game tiebreaker for the NL West title last season.
COLD CRUSH
Chris Davis is likely to get back into the lineup for Baltimore still seeking his first hit of 2019. The 33-year-old is 0 for 19 with 11 strikeouts this season — including 0 for 2 Saturday off the bench — and he's 0 for 40 dating to Sept. 14. Davis still has four years left on his $161 million contract, and Baltimore is hesitant to cut him loose. ""I'm seeing a guy who's giving a great effort. It's just not happening right now,"" manager Brandon Hyde said. ""We wanted to get him off to a good start. It's not the start he wanted to get off to, but I'm going to continue to play him and continue to support him and find the right matchups for him to try to get him off the schneid early.""
ONE STEP AT A TIME
Now that the Reds halted their 30-inning scoreless drought, they'll try to go further and snap a seven-game skid when they play their series finale at Pittsburgh. Cincinnati's longest streak without a run since 2015 ended Saturday when Kyle Farmer hit a two-run homer in the third. But the Reds are winless since taking their season opener against the Pirates under new manager David Bell. They entered Saturday with a major league-low .157 batting average and only three homers. ""We've been struggling to get the wins and we need to do that for sure,"" Bell said. ""But at the same time, I think scoring five runs after not scoring for a few days was big. I think we can build on that.""
STARTING HOT
Cleveland's starting pitchers have dominated Toronto over the first three games of their four-game set, and Mike Clevinger looks to do the same in the finale. Trevor Bauer pitched seven hitless innings Thursday, Shane Bieber allowed two runs in six innings Friday and Carlos Carrasco became the first Indians pitcher since at least 1908 to strike out 12 over five innings Saturday. Clevinger struck out a career-high 12 in his first start this season against the White Sox, and more swings and misses are likely against a Blue Jays club that has scored two or fewer runs in seven of its 10 games.
MAD MAX
Max Scherzer (0-2, 2.13 ERA) makes his third start in Washington's first eight games of the season when the Nationals play the rubber game of their series against the NL East rival New York Mets at Citi Field. The three-time Cy Young Award winner hasn't lost three straight starts since 2015, his first season in Washington. He faces Zack Wheeler and a Mets team that is 6-2 after hitting five homers off Nationals pitching Saturday.

MILWAUKEE — Looking to end an early season funk, the Chicago Cubs have shaken up their struggling bullpen by demoting right-hander Carl Edwards Jr. to Triple-A and placing left-hander Mike Montgomery on the 10-day injured list.
The Cubs called up relievers Allen Webster and Kyle Ryan from Triple-A Iowa in corresponding moves announced Saturday. Chicago has dropped six straight since winning on opening day, and its bullpen entered Saturday with an 8.54 ERA.
Edwards has an ERA of 32.40 in four appearances this season. Eight of the 13 batters he's faced have reached safely, and three of them homered. That includes a two-run shot by Milwaukee's Orlando Arcia in the Brewers' 13-10 win Friday night.
Montgomery hadn't fared much better, posting a 16.88 ERA in four appearances. He missed most of spring training because of shoulder soreness and was diagnosed with a strained left lat Saturday.
Chicago also designated right-hander Jen-Ho Tseng for assignment to clear space for Webster on the 40-man roster.
Webster, 29, had 1.50 ERA over 12 innings this spring. Ryan, 27, posted a 3.09 ERA in Cactus League play.
Both were in Milwaukee on Saturday and available to pitch in Game 2 of the Cubs' series against the Brewers.

MANCHESTER, England — Sergi Roberto might have noticed Lionel Messi’s battle scars first: the slightly swollen nose, or the faint trace of a bruise, flowering around his left eye. Or he might have realized that the rest of the Argentine’s features were of far greater concern: Messi’s brow was furrowed. His face was set into a scowl. He was staring straight at his teammate. Roberto had let him down.
His offense was one scuffed pass, a deflating climax to a wonderful, flowing move down Barcelona’s right flank. A better ball, a little more composure, and Messi would have had a glorious chance to double his team’s 1-0 lead — not necessarily enough to settle this Champions League quarterfinal, to doom Manchester United, but a significant tilting of the balance ahead of next week’s second leg in Barcelona at the Camp Nou.
It was, in Roberto’s defense, an aberration. Until that point, he had offered poise and drive since coming on as a substitute for Arthur, the Brazilian midfielder; he had improved Barcelona considerably.
By that stage, though, Messi was in no mood to consider mitigating circumstances. His frustration had been building for an hour or so — with himself, with his teammates, with what he very clearly felt was an overly physical approach from United’s defenders and an excessively lenient one from Gianluca Rocchi, the Italian referee. Through his war wounds, Messi subjected Roberto to his sternest glare.
Whenever Barcelona sweeps into town, it carries with it certain expectations. Barcelona is style and it is beauty. It is treasuring the ball, cherishing possession, every touch perfect and every pass precise. It is attacking intent and artistic sensibilities. Home crowds may not come to enjoy it — they may, in fact, come specifically to disrupt it — but they expect at least to admire it, teeth gritted and breath taken.
Much the same, of course, goes for watching Messi. He had not graced Old Trafford for more than a decade; United had not encountered him at all since 2011, when he orchestrated the defeat of Alex Ferguson’s team at Wembley in a second Champions League final.
Old Trafford was ready for him on this day, though. When the teams were read out before kickoff, there were deafening, vituperative jeers for both Philippe Coutinho and Luis Suárez: both, in Mancunian eyes, can be considered forever tainted by their association with Liverpool. Messi’s name attracted a little opprobrium, too: not quite the howling chorus reserved for his teammates, but not too far-off. In his case, it felt a little like a compliment, as though stopping him would require not just the 11 individuals on the field, but the 76,000 or so in the stands, too.
In some ways, then, Manchester United’s fans would leave the stadium, a couple of hours later, feeling as though they had done their job. Messi did create the game’s only goal — of course he did — with a darting run, a heavy touch, and an improvised cross for Suárez to head home (with the help of a final touch from Luke Shaw), but for long stretches he seemed subdued.
He drifted out wide in search of space and success, but found neither. He dropped deep, to try to light some fire in Barcelona’s belly, but could muster only embers. There were moments, of course — such is the quality of player Messi has around him that there will always be moments — but they were fleeting: the goal itself, the product of two minutes of possession, with every visiting player touching the ball; chances in the first half for Coutinho and in the second, after another spell of endless possession, of what seemed a thousand passes, for Suárez.
By the time Roberto had made his poor choice on the edge of Manchester United’s box, Messi was feeling frayed. He had not lived up to his own expectations, and neither had his team, though it is hard to separate which one of those is cause and which is consequence. Either way, Roberto’s errant delivery was the final straw. Messi glowered and glared.
And yet, while this victory felt like it came despite — rather than because of — Barcelona’s performance, it was, nevertheless, a victory, and in some lights rather an impressive one.
Barcelona did not play at all well for long stretches, and yet emerged with a lead, an away goal, and a sense that United had been kept at arm’s length with comparative ease. The home team, in fact, did not have a single shot on target; there were flurries of pressure, brief spells when Barcelona seemed to be teetering, only to be carried to safety by the nous and composure of Gerard Piqué, Clément Lenglet and Sergio Busquets.
It was not what we expect of Barcelona — and judging from Messi’s reaction, it is not necessarily what Barcelona expects of itself — but it showcased many of the traits that the team that goes on to win this competition tends to possess: maturity, cunning, patience, control, and, most decisive of all, an ability to click, even if only briefly, and find a gear that an opponent cannot match.
It is not a comparison that would be especially welcome in Catalonia, but in that sense it was a display straight out of the recent playbook of Barcelona’s archrival, Real Madrid: a sort of base level of organization, laced with enough individual talent to make a difference; a superiority that is not immediately visible, but that makes itself plain by the end.
Perhaps that is no bad thing. For the last 10 years, Barcelona has always been the most stylish, the most gifted, the most compelling team in the Champions League. It is the most immediately recognizable, the one that inspires the most fear, the one that comes with the greatest expectations.
It is Real Madrid that has won this competition in four of the last five years, though; at Barcelona, they worry that the club has let Messi down, somehow, in only permitting the finest player of his generation, or even of all time, to win the competition four times throughout his career. This may not feel like a vintage Barcelona team. It may not live up to the expectations imposed upon it. If it wins, though, if it lifts Messi’s scowl, it will not matter.

MADRID — Into the final of the Copa del Rey and with a comfortable 11-point lead at the top of La Liga, Barca coach Ernesto Valverde is expected to give a number of fringe players a chance when they visit bottom side Huesca on Saturday.
Treble-chasing Barca, who hold a 1-0 lead going into the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final against Man United next Tuesday, are comfortably ahead of second-placed Atletico Madrid, while great rivals Real sit 13 points behind the Catalans with just seven games to go.
The coach is almost certain to leave out Lionel Messi, whose nose was left bloodied and bruised by a robust challenge against United. ""He’s got a significant bruise and we'll have to see what the scans say,"" Valverde explained.
Barcelona's Brazilian duo Philippe Coutinho and Malcom will be particularly keen to impress. Coutinho, who joined Barcelona last January for a club record 142 million pounds from Liverpool, has flattered to deceive in Catalonia, unable to nail down a regular starting berth and was taken off after another anonymous hour in Wednesday's Champions League victory.
Malcom, meanwhile, has made just two La Liga starts this season and will look to use the opportunity to force his way into Valverde's plans for the tail end of the season.
""We'll see how everyone is, but there's not a lot of turnaround so it's quite possible we'll make changes for Saturday,"" Valverde told a news conference.
Atletico will be without Diego Costa for the rest of the season after his red card at Barcelona. The Spain international has been given an eight-game ban after he was accused of swearing at referee Jesus Gil Manzano before grabbing his arm and refusing to leave the field of play.
They host strugglers Celta Vigo this weekend and coach Diego Simeone insists they will still give their all until the end of the campaign.
""The season is nowhere near over,"" he said.
""I'll evaluate it with the fact we won the European Super Cup, that we are fighting it out for second place in the league once again. If that's seen as a poor season, then happy days.""
Celta sit two points outside the relegation zone, however their striker Iago Aspas has netted five goals in his last three appearances.
Elsewhere, Real visit fellow Madrid outfit Leganes on Monday night looking to keep up the pressure on Atleti in second, while Seville host Real Betis in what is always a feisty city derby on Saturday evening.

MADRID — Atletico Madrid striker Diego Costa has been handed an eight-match La Liga ban by the Spanish Football Federation’s Competition Committee for abusing the referee after he was shown the red card during last Sunday’s 2-0 defeat by Barcelona.
The official's report stated the 30-year-old swore and shouted at referee Jesus Gil Manzano and also grabbed him “on numerous occasions” after he had been given his marching orders in the 28th minute.
The ban, which ends Costa’s season as there are only seven games remaining, consists of four games for being found in breach of Article 94 of the league’s code of conduct for using insulting or offensive words towards a match official, and four matches for breaching Article 96, which refers to the use of light violence towards referees.
Atletico were fined 2800 euros (2,413.70 pounds), while Costa 6010 euros over the incident. They have 10 days in which they can lodge an appeal.

DENVER — Cody Bellinger homered again, Max Muncy also went deep and the homer-happy Los Angeles Dodgers outslugged the Colorado Rockies 12-6 on Sunday night.
Bellinger had three hits, including his major league-leading seventh home run, and has hit safely in 11 straight games dating to last year. The Dodgers have 24 homers and have connected in all 10 games. They scored 29 runs and swept a series at Coors Field for the second consecutive season.
Joe Kelly (1-1) pitched 1 2/3 innings in relief to get the win as ""Sunday Night Baseball"" on ESPN made its first appearance at Coors Field since 2001 with a game that lasted 3 hours, 52 minutes.
Colorado has lost seven of eight since starting the season with two wins. Nolan Arenado had three hits and three RBIs and Charlie Blackmon added two hits for the Rockies but committed a pair of embarrassing errors in right field.
Los Angeles scored two runs in the second and four in the third off Chad Bettis (0-2) and led 9-3 when Muncy hit a two-run homer in the sixth.
Bellinger capped a big weekend with a line drive to the second deck in right field. His seven home runs are more than seven teams have hit this season — including the Rockies.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Dodgers: LHP Clayton Kershaw (shoulder inflammation) will likely make his second rehab start Tuesday with Triple-A Oklahoma City or Double-A Tulsa. ... Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said LHP Tony Cingrani (left shoulder impingement) stretched his throwing to 120 feet.
Rockies: OF David Dahl left in the third inning. Manager Bud Black told the ESPN broadcast Dahl felt something in his abdomen below his oblique. ... LHP Tyler Anderson (left knee inflammation) was placed on the 10-day injured list. The team recalled RHP Yency Almonte from Triple-A Albuquerque. Anderson (0-2, 9.00 ERA) struggled in his two starts.
FAN INTERFERENCE
With Bellinger at the plate and one out in the sixth the game was interrupted by a fan who climbed over the railing in left-center and ran onto the field. He made it to the infield by second base before falling. He was apprehended and walked off the field.
NEW MATH
Dodgers second baseman Enrique Hernandez took a toss from shortstop Corey Seager for a force at second and started jogging off the field. Problem was, there were only two outs. Hernandez's mental error allowed Arenado to score from third and kept the inning alive.
WELCOME BACK
The Dodgers recalled right-hander Dennis Santana from Triple-A Oklahoma City and optioned righty Brock Stewart to their top farm team. Santana, who made his only major league appearance at Coors Field last season, was one of the last players left off the roster coming out of spring training. He entered with one out in the seventh and hit Mark Reynolds with his first pitch of the night.
UP NEXT
Dodgers: LHP Hyun-Jin Ryu (2-0, 2.08 ERA) opens a series in St. Louis on Monday night. He is 1-2 with a 2.25 ERA in five games (four starts) against the Cardinals.
Rockies: LHP Kyle Freeland (1-1, 2.31) makes his third start when Colorado begins a three-game home series against Atlanta on Monday night.

MANCHESTER — Barcelona defender Gerard Pique praised his side for shutting out Manchester United in Wednesday's 1-0 win at Old Trafford as the Catalans seized the advantage in their Champions League quarter-final tie.
An early own goal by Luke Shaw, who deflected in a header from Luis Suarez, decided a tight first leg and gave Barca their first victory at Old Trafford in five attempts in European competition.
""We put in an excellent performance defensively, we're in our best form in defence of the season. The early goal relaxed us and we knew how to cope with the situation, the fact we didn't concede helps us a lot,"" Pique told reporters.
""It's very difficult to come here, it's an historical ground, there's a sensational atmosphere and you get put under a lot of pressure.""
The only goal of the game came from a clever cross by Lionel Messi although Barca's captain was kept unusually quiet for the remainder, after being left with a bloodied face from a clash with United's Chris Smalling.
""Messi felt very uncomfortable after the blow to the head, we'll have to examine him tomorrow to see how he is, it was a strong blow, he has a large bruise,"" said Barca coach Ernesto Valverde.
Midfielder Sergio Busquets added: ""It was a big blow, he has a scar and he bled a lot, it was obviously uncomfortable for him but he put on a brave face and played as best as he could, as he always does.""
United had far more attempts than the runaway La Liga leaders but they could not muster a single shot on target, and visiting goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen was never tested.
""We leave here with a good sensation but we know they will give everything away from home,"" added Valverde.
Barca have failed to reach the Champions League semi-finals since 2015 yet the win at Old Trafford sets them up well for next Tuesday's second leg at the Nou Camp, where they are unbeaten in their last 30 matches in Europe's elite competition.
Pique, however, said Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side could not be written off after their remarkable turnaround against Paris St Germain in the last-16, in which they overturned a 2-0 first-leg deficit by winning 3-1 in the French capital.
""After seeing what they did against PSG there's no reason at all to believe the tie is over,"" Pique said.
""PSG were the clear favourites then, they played far better and look what happened. Anything can happen in football so we'll have to focus very hard.""

MANCHESTER, England — Manchester United's young midfielder Scott McTominay showed against Barcelona on Wednesday that he not only merits a starting place in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side but that he can compete with the very best.
There were few standout United performances in the 1-0 home defeat but the 22-year-old McTominay certainly took his chance in a side that still lacks genuine creativity and attacking threat despite improvements under Solskjaer.
A midfield of McTominay, Fred, Diogo Dalot and Paul Pogba did not look, on paper, a strong match for the Spanish giants but they grafted and fought to limit the service provided to Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez.
While Pogba was unable to lift his game for the big occasion, United academy product McTominay, who had shown glimpses of his quality under Jose Mourinho, played with real confidence.
""Scott McTominay was fantastic,"" said Solskjaer.
""Every time he plays for us he is improving. He's a great athlete, wins his challenges and is quick on his feet. He started settling us to be fair.""
Owen Hargreaves, the former United midfielder now working as a pundit on BT Sport, was full of praise for the Scotland international.
""For that young man to be the best (United) player on the pitch when Fred cost 50 million pounds, Pogba cost 90 million -- it’s quite exceptional really,"" he said.
“That solidified him as a Manchester United regular. That’s a defining moment for the young man against that Barcelona team.""
The midfielder himself felt that United had competed well after a slow start, but lacked a cutting edge.
""In the first 10 minutes we showed them far too much respect but after that we adapted really well and looked the better side,"" he said.
""Barcelona are top class, it's difficult to get the ball. It's not as easy as going out to press like mayhem.
""We have to do more in front of goal, score more goals. It's a big second leg to go. It's only halftime. We are Manchester United and you can never write us off,"" he added.

MANCHESTER, England — Barcelona overcame a punchless Manchester United to take the upper hand in their Champions League quarter-final after Luke Shaw's own goal gave them a 1-0 first-leg victory at Old Trafford on Wednesday.
Shaw deflected a Luis Suarez header into his own net after 12 minutes, handing the Catalans a vital away goal that will make them clear favourites in the return leg.
After United's comeback against Paris St Germain in the previous round, Barca will take nothing for granted, but Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's team will struggle to repeat the trick against a side with a fearsome home record.
""We played a good team,"" said Solskjaer. ""We know you have to defend a lot without the ball and you might be tired when you get the chance yourself. We go there with one thing in my mind, we have to score.""
Barca have not lost at home for 30 games in the Champions League since 2013 and while United can take credit for staying in the tie, they produced little that will overly worry the Spanish side.
Barcelona's first win at Old Trafford in European competition was relatively comfortable with their keeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen not having a single shot to save.
With Paul Pogba failing to impact the game, United were left trying to hit Barca on the break or from set-pieces and too often they lacked the precision to make the most of the few openings that fell their way.
The crucial away goal was well-worked. Sergio Busquets found Lionel Messi with a clever ball into the area and the Argentine carved out space on the left to deliver a lofted cross to former Liverpool striker Suarez at the back post.
The Uruguayan's header deflected off the shoulder of a scrambling Shaw and beat David De Gea to give the visitors the lead and although the linesman initially flagged for offside, the goal was given after a VAR video review.
DE GEA SAVES
United had De Gea to thank for keeping the difference down to a single goal as he saved superbly with his feet to keep out Philippe Coutinho in the 36th minute.
Then the home side had an appeal for a penalty waved away after Scott McTominay, who had a fine game in midfield, went down under a challenge from Gerard Pique.
United's best chance of the first half fell to Diogo Dalot but the Portuguese made a mess of a fine Marcus Rashford ball, heading harmlessly across the goal from close-range.
Solskjaer's team had struggled to get a foothold in the game during the opening 45 minutes, but they were much improved after the break, applying plenty of pressure without creating any clear chances.
Barcelona could have added a second had Suarez not fired into the side-netting from a promising position after a clever through ball from Nelson Semedo and then De Gea did well to foil Jordi Alba's low drive -- again with his legs.
The loss was United's fourth in their last five games in all competitions.
""We did as well as we could against Messi, kept our shape well. It could have gone both ways,"" said Solskjaer.
""I don't think we hit the target and that's a disappointment. We go there with work to be done but chances,"" he added.
Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde was pleased with the result, especially given the club's previous failure to win at Old Trafford in four earlier meetings in European competition.
""Given the atmosphere and the type of team they are and that this is the Champions League it's very hard to win here, it was a very difficult game and things were complicated for us at a few moments,"" he said.
""We had spells of dominance they pressured us very high but we created the clearest chances,"" he added.

Jon Cooper and Todd Reirden were coaching at the All-Star Game in January when the topic of winning the Presidents' Trophy came up.
With Cooper's Tampa Bay Lightning cruising toward winning it as the NHL's best team, he asked the Washington coach how to handle it. Reirden was less than helpful.
""I said: 'Good luck! I don't know what you're talking about,'"" Reirden recalled with a grin.
Finishing at the top of the league comes with expectations, but only two of 13 Presidents' Trophy winners in the salary cap era have gone on to win the Stanley Cup and none since 2013. If this is the burden to bear for Tampa Bay, the Lightning seem OK with it.
""Nobody in there is sitting there thinking now we've got a path to the Stanley Cup finals,"" Cooper said. ""As a matter of fact, actually the odds are probably grossly against us just in the sense there's going to be 15 other teams. Any time you go in somewhere and say, 'OK, we're going to pick this team' and somebody's got the field, usually the field is the teams to take.""
Taking the field this time means betting against a team that was 21 points clear of anyone else in the league, has the top scorer and likely MVP in Nikita Kucherov, a Vezina Trophy candidate in goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy and looks built for this moment. Of course, so did the Nashville Predators last year.
When the Predators clinched the Presidents' Trophy against the Capitals, who won it the previous two years, winger Filip Forsberg said: ""We've seen especially here that the trophy doesn't mean that much going forward.""
It didn't, and Nashville lost in the second round to Winnipeg in seven games.
The Capitals have won the Presidents' Trophy three times in the Alex Ovechkin era — under coach Bruce Boudreau in 2010 and Barry Trotz in 2016 and 2017 (with Reirden as his top assistant) — and lost in the first or second round each time.
""Obviously it comes with a little bit of pressure,"" Capitals center Nicklas Backstrom said. ""You are the best team in the regular season and you obviously have more work to do I think than just regular season.""
Boudreau, now with Minnesota, said the pressure stems from constant questions players face because ""they can't away from it"" more than a feeling of internal superiority. But nine years after getting beaten by red-hot goaltender Jaroslav Halak and Montreal in the first round, Boudreau vividly remembers a Game 6 feeling of, ""Oh my God, if we lose this game!""
They did. Tampa Bay defenseman Braydon Coburn remembers it clearly because it helped pave the way for his run to the Cup Final with Philadelphia. He and his Lightning teammates are keenly aware of other teams' missteps in the same spot they find themselves in now.
""You look to the past,"" Coburn said. ""You try to take them as lessons. I don't think you try to psych yourself out in any sort of way. But I think you look back to that Washington series against Montreal, I remember it very well. It was Halak. He played out of his mind. That's the thing about playoffs is you never know what's going to happen.""
What should happen based on 1,271 regular season games is Steven Stamkos raising the Stanley Cup over his head in June. But that was also the case for the San Jose Sharks in 2009 with Joe Thornton and Patrick Marleau in their primes, and they, too, lost in the first round.
""It's one of those things you can't let down your guard,"" said Marleau, now with Toronto. ""You can't feel comfortable for a second. It's a brand new season. Anything can happen. There's bounces, inches. It's a game of inches. Just not to take your foot off the gas. If anything, it's the time to really bear down.""
The Lightning clinched the NHL's best record with several games left in the season, which takes away some of urgency on the ice — in a bad way.
""We weren't playing playoff hockey — we were playing high-end, regular-season hockey, which is a big difference,"" said Minnesota's Eric Fehr, who was on that Capitals team in 2010. ""It's just the intensity of taking the puck to the net and not playing as much on the perimeter and not trying to make fancy plays. You see the high-end teams in the regular season, they're making fancy plays, they're scoring 3-on-2 goals. You get to the playoffs and it's point shots, tips and battles in front of the net. That's the difference is you have to be playing that style of game come playoff time.""
Tampa Bay was the highest-scoring team in the league, so it's an adjustment to playoff-style hockey but something the group is used to after reaching the Eastern Conference finals last year. Forward Adam Erne said the ""sour taste"" from a seven-game loss to Washington is a motivation, and more experienced teammates are trying to impart some knowledge about what to do next.
""Just keep a present mind frame,"" said defenseman Ryan McDonagh, who won the Presidents' Trophy with the New York Rangers in 2015. ""That' been the best thing with this group all year is we've just focused on each day at a time and not look at big picture and what's going on around us, what's going on with other teams.""
All well and good, but previous top teams have done the same and not been able to live up to the billing. Carolina captain Justin Williams played on the 2016 and 2017 Capitals Presidents' Trophy winning teams and acknowledged maybe it played a role in players gripping their sticks a little too tightly in the playoffs.
""It's really hard to get in and there's really no clear favorites once you get in,"" Williams said. ""But playing the favorite is a little bit different with the expectations for you to win.""

SAPPORO, Japan — Japan captain Michael Leitch has accused some top tier nations of wanting to keep high level rugby to themselves after the Sunwolves, Japan's representatives in Super Rugby, were told they would be cut from the elite competition after the 2020 season.
The decision by organiser SANZAAR to revert to a purely southern hemisphere Super Rugby competition was a major blow for Japan and those who champion the growth of the game, as the nation prepares to showcase its development as hosts of the World Cup.
Leitch, who hasn't featured for the Sunwolves this season due to commitments with the national team, believes this is a mistake and that exposure to higher levels of competition is the only way to grow the sport he loves.
""It feels like the strong teams play within themselves and won't let anyone else in,"" Leitch said in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday.
""The Japanese team, we need exposure and we need to be playing top, Tier One nations on a regular basis.
""I am very disappointed. The reason the national team now is making great steps towards beating quality sides is because we have got that exposure to a higher level.""
Japan have made strides in recent years, following their famous victory over South Africa at the 2015 Rugby World Cup. They have recorded comfortable victories over Italy and Tonga and drawn with France in Paris.
ASIAN REPRESENTATIVES
The Sunwolves joined Super Rugby in 2016 as World Rugby looked to ramp up enthusiasm for the Rugby World Cup, which begins in Tokyo on Sept. 20.
World Rugby has insisted that hosting the first World Cup outside the sport's traditional heartland will boost the sport in Asia. But the decision to exclude the Sunwolves from the Super Rugby club competition appears to contradict that.
""To grow the game in Asia, we need the Sunwolves to be playing, and ideally we want the Sunwolves to be a team that all the Asian countries can look up to,"" argued Leitch.
""I think the Sunwolves was the key to expanding in Asia, playing in Singapore and Hong Kong ... but the powers who control the world clearly didn't see it like that.""
There has been talk of a lucrative, competitive league being set-up in Japan following the World Cup, but the Japanese Rugby Football Union are yet to confirm any changes to the sport's structure.
One thing is for certain as far as Leitch is concerned: The current Top League structure will not produce players capable of challenging the established powers at the top of the international game.
""To be honest with you, Top League doesn't prepare you well for test matches,"" said Leitch.
""It will prepare you to beat Tier Two teams on a regular basis, but if you want to become a real formidable force in the world then you have got to be playing in the most competitive competition.""
The Sunwolves, who have lost six of their eight matches this season, are next in Super Rugby action against the Hurricanes on April 19.

Mike Smith and David Rittich helped the Calgary Flames finish first in the Western Conference.
Yet there are still questions about how far those goalies can carry their team in the playoffs.
Smith and Rittich sounds more like a law firm than the goaltending tandem anyone expected the NHL's second-best team to have. Smith is a 37-year-old veteran with a sub.-900 save percentage seven years removed from his last playoff action, while Rittich is a 26-year-old in his first full year in the league who would be getting his first taste of the Stanley Cup playoffs.
It's not out of the realm of possibility the Flames split the duties like they did all season, and as a result they're one of several teams with goaltending questions as the playoffs begin. Winnipeg, San Jose and Toronto are among the other serious contenders with significant question marks in net at the wrong time of year to have them.
""We wouldn't be where we are without our goaltending,"" Calgary general manager Brad Treliving said. ""We've gotten strong goaltending all year at the right time. What we've never really had is times in the year where both guys are maybe going through a little bit of a skid.""
Treliving wouldn't be surprised if coach Bill Peters uses both goalies in the playoffs, a ""nontraditional"" strategy but not one he thinks is a problem. Smith figures to start Game 1 of the first round against Colorado on Thursday, but it's up in the air after that.
The Flames at least know they can turn to another goalie if one falters. San Jose — which had the worst team save percentage in the NHL at .889 will go with Martin Jones, but backup Aaron Dell has struggled plenty this season, too. The Sharks also open against the defending West champion Vegas Golden Knights, who have arguably the best goaltending situation in the playoffs assuming Marc-Andre Fleury is healthy.
Winnipeg will ride with Connor Hellebuyck, even though Laurent Brossoit should be back from injury to back up in Game 1 Wednesday against St. Louis, which has out-of-nowhere phenom Jordan Binnington. Hellebuyck has not been quite as stellar this year as last when he carried a strong regular season into the West final, though that run could pay dividends this time around.
""One thing that you can't substitute is experience,"" Jets GM Kevin Cheveldayoff said. ""Once you go through something and you experience it, you have a mental template of how you need to act and what you liked about it, what you didn't like about it. So now he's got that experience. He likes to play big games.""
With big games to come against the Boston Bruins, Toronto's Frederik Andersen better be up to the task for the Maple Leafs to avoid a third consecutive first-round exit. Andersen is 3-3-3 with a 3.94 goals-against average and .881 save percentage in his last 10 games and wondered if injuries have thrown off his rhythm.
""I think I've played more games and felt better"" in previous seasons, Andersen said. ""This year I've been banged up a little bit at times and obviously with the time I missed, it's been different.""
After coach Mike Babcock said nothing is more important going into playoffs than a goaltender feeling good about himself, Andersen's response might not portend great things for Toronto. Add to that switching out regular backup Garret Sparks for Michael Hutchinson at the eleventh hour and there's Philadelphia Flyers-level goalie drama going on with the Maple Leafs.
There's no drama with the Flames, who finished second in the league in goals behind Presidents' Trophy winning Tampa Bay and are confident going into the playoffs. While Columbus acquired Keith Kinkaid from New Jersey for depth behind Sergei Bobrovsky and Joonas Korpisalo, Calgary didn't come close to such a move and will roll along with Smith and Rittich.
""That was not a discussion point for us,"" Treliving said. ""They have a great relationship, they push each other, they cheer for each other when they're not in the net. I don't pay a whole lot of attention to things outside of our room. We just worry about ourselves inside that room, and I know our guys have a lot of confidence in both guys.""

(Reuters) - Britain's Tara Moore stared the dreaded 'double bagel' in the face as she trailed 0-6 0-5 30-40 to French third seed Jessika Ponchet in this week's ITF World Tour event in Sunderland and could have been excused for wanting the ground to open up.
Instead, she produced a great sporting comeback -- recovering to win from a seemingly impossible position.
Languishing at nearly 500 in the WTA rankings, Moore saved the match point with a smash that skimmed the net tape before landing on the line -- then set about clawing her way back into contention before winning 0-6 7-6 6-3.
""Never in doubt"" the 26-year-old, who reached the second round of Wimbledon in 2016, said on social media.
Tennis has seen many great comebacks in the past.
Andre Agassi won the 1999 French Open final against Andrei Medvedev after winning only three games in the first two sets.
Before that in 1987 his fellow American Jimmy Connors, aged 34, trailed Swede Mikael Pernfors 6-1 6-1 4-1 at Wimbledon before pulling off a remarkable victory.
This year Czech Karolina Pliskova trailed 5-1 in the final set of her Australian Open quarter-final against Serena Williams, but won the last six games to triumph.
While Moore's snatching of victory from the jaws of defeat perhaps surpasses those, American Lisa Raymond went one better at the 2004 French Open.
She trailed 6-0 5-0 and faced two match points against Czech Ľubomira Kurhajcova before winning 0-6 7-5 6-3.

DETROIT — Christin Stewart hit a two-out grand slam in the seventh inning, lifting the Detroit Tigers to a 7-4 victory over the Kansas City Royals on Saturday.
The Tigers trailed 4-2 in the seventh but rallied against Kansas City's struggling bullpen. Kevin McCarthy (0-1) allowed three hits and a hit batter. The only out on his watch came with the score 4-3, when Alex Gordon threw Josh Harrison out at the plate. Detroit eventually loaded the bases with two out, and Stewart hit a drive down the line in right field off Wily Peralta.
It was the second home run of the season for Detroit's rookie outfielder. Stewart's other one was also big — a 10th-inning shot at Toronto that provided all the scoring in a 2-0 victory in the season opener.
Whit Merrifield, Jorge Soler and Hunter Dozier all homered for the Royals, but Kansas City's bullpen — which entered the game with a 7.45 ERA — couldn't hold on.
Shane Greene pitched a perfect ninth and now has saves in all six Detroit victories this season — without blowing any. The Tigers have won four straight, and the Royals have dropped five in a row.
Tigers starter Matt Moore retired the first eight hitters he faced, but he left the game after three innings with a sprained right knee. Detroit led 2-0 in the sixth when Merrifield hit a solo shot, extending his hitting streak to 27 games. Kansas City then tied it in the seventh on a home run by Soler, and Dozier hit a two-run homer off Victor Alcantara (2-0) later that inning.
Nicholas Castellanos hit an RBI single in the seventh for the Tigers, and Miguel Cabrera followed with a single that could have loaded the bases with nobody out. Instead, third-base coach Dave Clark sent Harrison, who was thrown out at home. One out later, Jeimer Candelario drew a walk that loaded the bases for Stewart.
Merrifield's hitting streak, which dates to last season, is now tied for the second-longest in Royals' history. Jose Offerman had a 27-game streak in 1998, and George Brett had a 30-game run in 1980.
Royals first baseman Frank Schwindel, whose error in the second gave Detroit the game's first run, singled in the seventh for his first career hit.
Cabrera hit an RBI single in the fifth that put the Tigers up 2-0.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Tigers: OF JaCoby Jones (left shoulder) and RHP Drew VerHagen (right shoulder) started rehab assignments with Class A Lakeland on Friday night. Jones went 1 for 4 but struck out three times, which left Detroit manager Ron Gardenhire a bit bemused. ""Says, 'When am I getting out of this place?' You're in A ball, just struck out three times,"" Gardenhire said with a smile. ""When you get a couple hits, not strike out three times in A ball — that would be my answer.""
UP NEXT
Royals: RHP Brad Keller (1-0) takes the mound in the series finale Sunday. Because of off days, he'll be able to start for the third time in Kansas City's first eight games.
Tigers: RHP Tyson Ross (0-1) makes his first home start for Detroit after signing in the offseason.

SUNRISE, Fla. — The Florida Panthers have fired coach Bob Boughner, who led the team for the past two seasons and didn't get to the playoffs in either one.
The Panthers announced the move Sunday, one day after the team's season ended. Assistant coach Paul McFarland also was fired.
Panthers general manager Dale Tallon called it ""a tough decision"" and says the team needs a coach with a ""Stanley Cup pedigree.""
Florida missed the playoffs by one point in Boughner's first season. The Panthers missed the playoffs by 12 points this season, wasting a year when Aleksander Barkov set a club record with 96 points and the team had three 30-goal scorers.
Florida won 80 of its 164 games under Boughner's tenure. The Panthers have missed the playoffs 16 times in the last 18 seasons.

CALGARY, Alberta — Edmonton Oilers star Connor McDavid injured his left leg and left Saturday's season finale against the Calgary Flames after colliding with the net.
McDavid was helped off the ice by teammate Zack Kassian and a trainer after crashing into the Flames' net.
McDavid fell to the ice after being challenged by Flames defenseman Mark Giordano and then slid hard into the net.
McDavid held his left leg for several minutes before being helped off. There was no immediate word on the extent of the injury.
The 22-year-old McDavid is second in the league in scoring this season with 116 points.
The Oilers were eliminated from playoff contention earlier this week.

NEW YORK — The WNBA's logo is getting a new look and the league is resetting its brand for the upcoming season.
The league unveiled its plans Monday as it looks to embrace the optimism of the women across the WNBA in building the next generation of fans.
""We are excited about all of it,"" WNBA chief operating officer Christy Hedgpeth said by phone last week. ""It starts with our purpose, which is to expand our audience and grow at a faster rate.
""We believe we'll do that by becoming more and more culturally relevant over time. It led us to a new target consumer, new design target that's much, much younger — the 16-to-34 millennials, who are very diverse, very socially conscious, engaged in issues of today.""
The WNBA's 23rd season begins May 24, with the Seattle Storm the defending champion.
The league partnered with Sylvain Labs, an innovation and brand design consultancy last year, to learn more about its existing fans and potential new fans. They developed a long-term growth strategy and identify new marketing opportunities.
""We've engaged very, very closely throughout this process,"" Hedgpeth said. ""Six months working with Sylvain Labs to develop what the new brand will stand for.""
The two groups, along with player input, came up with the league's new logo.
""They took the silhouette out of the box which is a massive breakthrough as she was perceived totally different,"" Hedgpeth said. ""She was free, there was more movement there, taking up more space. She's more athletic, longer physique. This is basketball on our terms. That was a phrase that really resonated with the players. That's really symbolic in that regard.""
The new logo is different from others affiliated with the NBA.
""The NBA logo, there's a rectangle around him, he's in a box. Same with the G-League logo and the previous W-logo. She had a box around her,"" Hedgpeth said. ""The box is going away. It's powerful, it's freeing and it's expansive.""
It's the first time the league will have a new logo since 2013. While the new logo won't be on the uniforms or balls until next year because of the lack of production time needed to do it, it will be everywhere else around the league.
Hedgpeth insisted that the logo wasn't modeled after one player and that the hair was a huge part of the conversation. The logo has a bun which represents the way many players wear their hair.
The league also has a new marquee partner in AT&T.
""They are a perfect fit,"" Hedgpeth said. ""They have such a great fit to diversity and inclusion and accurately portraying women in advertising.""

A look at what's happening around the majors Sunday:
MIGHTY, MIGHTY MARINERS
Seattle has been swinging big in 2019, entering its series finale against the White Sox leading the majors with 24 homers. All that power has the Mariners off to an 8-2 start, best in club history. Jay Bruce went deep twice and Tim Beckham added a three-run shot in a 9-2 win Saturday over Chicago. Bruce leads the club with five homers, and Beckham and Domingo Santana are next with four each — all three of those players were added in the offseason, part of a rebuild by general manager Jerry Dipoto.
MILE HIGH SPOTLIGHT
Sunday Night Baseball on ESPN makes its first appearance at Coors Field since 2001 when Nolan Arenado and the Rockies host Justin Turner and the Los Angeles Dodgers, who beat Colorado in a one-game tiebreaker for the NL West title last season.
COLD CRUSH
Chris Davis is likely to get back into the lineup for Baltimore still seeking his first hit of 2019. The 33-year-old is 0 for 19 with 11 strikeouts this season — including 0 for 2 Saturday off the bench — and he's 0 for 40 dating to Sept. 14. Davis still has four years left on his $161 million contract, and Baltimore is hesitant to cut him loose. ""I'm seeing a guy who's giving a great effort. It's just not happening right now,"" manager Brandon Hyde said. ""We wanted to get him off to a good start. It's not the start he wanted to get off to, but I'm going to continue to play him and continue to support him and find the right matchups for him to try to get him off the schneid early.""
ONE STEP AT A TIME
Now that the Reds halted their 30-inning scoreless drought, they'll try to go further and snap a seven-game skid when they play their series finale at Pittsburgh. Cincinnati's longest streak without a run since 2015 ended Saturday when Kyle Farmer hit a two-run homer in the third. But the Reds are winless since taking their season opener against the Pirates under new manager David Bell. They entered Saturday with a major league-low .157 batting average and only three homers. ""We've been struggling to get the wins and we need to do that for sure,"" Bell said. ""But at the same time, I think scoring five runs after not scoring for a few days was big. I think we can build on that.""
STARTING HOT
Cleveland's starting pitchers have dominated Toronto over the first three games of their four-game set, and Mike Clevinger looks to do the same in the finale. Trevor Bauer pitched seven hitless innings Thursday, Shane Bieber allowed two runs in six innings Friday and Carlos Carrasco became the first Indians pitcher since at least 1908 to strike out 12 over five innings Saturday. Clevinger struck out a career-high 12 in his first start this season against the White Sox, and more swings and misses are likely against a Blue Jays club that has scored two or fewer runs in seven of its 10 games.
MAD MAX
Max Scherzer (0-2, 2.13 ERA) makes his third start in Washington's first eight games of the season when the Nationals play the rubber game of their series against the NL East rival New York Mets at Citi Field. The three-time Cy Young Award winner hasn't lost three straight starts since 2015, his first season in Washington. He faces Zack Wheeler and a Mets team that is 6-2 after hitting five homers off Nationals pitching Saturday.

MILWAUKEE — Looking to end an early season funk, the Chicago Cubs have shaken up their struggling bullpen by demoting right-hander Carl Edwards Jr. to Triple-A and placing left-hander Mike Montgomery on the 10-day injured list.
The Cubs called up relievers Allen Webster and Kyle Ryan from Triple-A Iowa in corresponding moves announced Saturday. Chicago has dropped six straight since winning on opening day, and its bullpen entered Saturday with an 8.54 ERA.
Edwards has an ERA of 32.40 in four appearances this season. Eight of the 13 batters he's faced have reached safely, and three of them homered. That includes a two-run shot by Milwaukee's Orlando Arcia in the Brewers' 13-10 win Friday night.
Montgomery hadn't fared much better, posting a 16.88 ERA in four appearances. He missed most of spring training because of shoulder soreness and was diagnosed with a strained left lat Saturday.
Chicago also designated right-hander Jen-Ho Tseng for assignment to clear space for Webster on the 40-man roster.
Webster, 29, had 1.50 ERA over 12 innings this spring. Ryan, 27, posted a 3.09 ERA in Cactus League play.
Both were in Milwaukee on Saturday and available to pitch in Game 2 of the Cubs' series against the Brewers.

MINNEAPOLIS — Michigan State thought it had a mismatch. Thanks to a switch by Texas Tech's defense, Xavier Tillman was being guarded by a smaller player in the post.
The Spartans worked the ball around, got it into Tillman and the 6-foot-8, 245-pound forward tried to bull his way to the basket.
Swat!
Swinging in from the weak side of the defense, Texas Tech's Tariq Owens swooped in, reached out his long right arm and sent the shot back where it came from.
Advantage: Red Raiders.
""They switch everything, so now you think, 'we have an advantage down low because they've got big on little,' but you really don't because they've got Owens coming from the weak side sitting on that,"" Sacramento State coach Brian Katz said on Sunday. ""The post guy is fixated on the little guy because he's going one on one, but he's really not.""
Basketball big men have gone through a metamorphasis in recent years.
The plodding, paint-filling big has become nearly extinct, replaced by long, athletic players who can shoot, dribble and beat defenders off the bounce. The new-era big man has opened up the game, making it more high scoring and free flowing.
They're also changing the way teams play defense.
An athletic big man allows teams to switch on every screen without creating massive mismatches, and to have a rim protector who doesn't have to be camped under the basket to block shots.
Kentucky was one of the first switch-everything teams in 2011-12, Anthony Davis and his fellow long, long-limbed teammates giving teams fits on their way to the national championship.
Texas Tech has taken a nearly identical approach, with the 6-10 Owens playing a similar defensive role as Davis and a host of comparably sized players harassing opponents all the way into the national title game Monday night against Virginia.
The Cavaliers, annually one of the nation's best defensive teams, have an equally-disruptive big man in 6-9 Mamadi Diakite, who has the athleticism to switch on the perimeter and soar in for blocks.
""When you can play good defense, but you have some length or shot blocking behind it, it just adds another element to being harder to score against,"" Virginia coach Tony Bennett said.
These athletic shot blockers also can cause an offensive killer: hesitation.
Traditionally, a mismatch in the post would lead to a quick move by the bigger player or a kickout when a double team comes.
Now, knowing an athletic shot blocker is lurking on the weak side, there's a pause as the post player sorts out what to do. The hesitation leads to offensive stagnancy and allows the defense to ramp up the pressure.
Even if the post player takes advantage of the mismatch and scores at the rim a couple of times, coaches no longer overreact and change the way they play defense.
""When you switch out hard and take away the 3 and they score inside, well, it's only a 2. It's not a 3,"" Katz said. ""Four years ago I wouldn't have said that. Used to be, when you're coaching and a guy scores down low, there was a tendency to react to that. Now you kind of go, eh, it's just a 2, no big deal.""
The changes in defensive approaches have altered what programs look for on the recruiting trail.
""We recruit to shot-blocking. That's not normal. Not everyone does that,"" said Russ Turner, who led UC Irvine to a first-round win over Kansas State in this year's NCAA Tournament. ""We don't draw charges, we block shots. Not that you have to do one or the other, but we put more emphasis on blocking shots. It's just another way to look at it.""
In a copycat world of college basketball, the success of teams like Virginia and Texas Tech will certainly lead to more coaches looking at it that way.

(Reuters) - Lokesh Rahul gave India's selectors a timely reminder of his abilities with an unbeaten century for Kings XI Punjab in the Indian Premier League on Wednesday.
Rahul, 26, is among a number of batsmen hopeful of securing the number four position in an otherwise settled India batting lineup ahead of the World Cup in England and Wales starting on May 30.
Ahead of the squad announcement on April 15, Rahul followed up scores of 55 and 71 not out with a maiden IPL ton as Kings XI posted a total of 197 for four in 20 overs against three-times champions Mumbai Indians.
Rahul, who was briefly suspended earlier this year for inappropriate comments on a television show, smashed six fours and six sixes in a 116-run stand with fellow opener Chris Gayle who scored 63.
In reply, Mumbai's Kieron Pollard hit a blistering 31-ball 83 as they clinched a last-ball three-wicket victory.

LONDON — Arsenal manager Unai Emery says striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang will be ready to start Thursday's Europa League quarter-final first leg at home to Napoli after illness kept him on the bench for their past two games.
""He had a small problem and has taken antibiotics for his illness,"" Emery told a news conference on Wednesday. ""That's the main reason he didn't start those matches. For tomorrow he's getting better and can start or can play after.""
Emery is also waiting on late fitness tests for central defender Laurent Koscielny and midfielder Granit Xhaka.
The visit of Carlo Ancelotti's Napoli, a distant second behind Juventus in Serie A, represents a big step up in class for Emery's Arsenal in the competition.
The London club will be desperate to travel to Italy with a positive result from the Emirates, having struggled past BATE and Rennes in the previous rounds after losing the away legs.
""Carlo Ancelotti is top. He has experience in all the competitions, in all the countries. His coaching career is amazing,"" Emery said.
""This is a big-level match, and the level we want to play. It's a very big test for us.""
Striker Alexandre Lacazette said Arsenal must respond after losing to Everton in the Premier League last weekend -- a result that left them outside the top four in the race to qualify for next season's Champions League.
""On Sunday we played badly, all the team,"" he said. ""We didn't do what the coach asked us, but we still have confidence.""
Napoli also struggled in their Serie A game at the weekend, drawing 1-1 against Genoa, and Ancelotti said he hopes the result will have served as a wake-up call to his players.
""It was an unexpected performance, which rings alarm bells,"" he said.
""We'll find things very difficult if we play like that in London. We've not yet spoken in detail about that game. I don't want to talk about a mental dip.""

Mike Trout got the day off to recover from a strained right groin, and the Los Angeles Angels made the most of their five hits in a 4-2 win over the Milwaukee Brewers on Wednesday night at Anaheim, Calif., completing a three-game sweep.
It also was the Angels' sixth win in a row, putting Los Angeles (7-6) above .500 for the first time this season.
Three of the Angels' hits came in the third inning, when they scored all four of their runs. The big blow was Justin Bour's two-run single that snapped a 1-1 tie. Brian Goodwin started in center field in place of Trout, who is day-to-day, and made a Trout-like catch, robbing Yasmani Grandal of a potential home run in the second inning.
Angels starter Felix Pena gave up only an unearned run on three hits and two walks, but he lasted only four innings and didn't qualify for the win after throwing 72 pitches. The victory went to Jaime Barria, called up from Triple-A Salt Lake earlier in the day. Barria (1-0) gave up one run over 2 2/3 innings, and Hansel Robles pitched the ninth for his first save.
Mariners 6, Royals 5
Mitch Haniger's two-out, solo home run in the top of the ninth inning gave Seattle the victory over host Kansas City as the Mariners extended baseball's best record to 12-2 with their fifth straight win.
The Royals (2-9) have lost nine straight, but Whit Merrifield extended his hitting streak to 31 games with an RBI bunt single in the seventh.
Anthony Swarzak (1-0) picked up the win in relief. The Mariners became the second team since 1908 (2002 Cleveland Indians) to homer in each of their first 14 games.
Astros 8, Yankees 6
Jose Altuve recorded his fourth career multi-homer game while Collin McHugh produced another effective start as Houston capped a perfect homestand and a three-game sweep of New York.
One night after recording his 100th career home run, Altuve socked solo dingers in the first and fifth innings. He was one of five Astros to record a multi-hit game and led the charge against Yankees left-hander James Paxton (1-2).
Paxton tormented Houston pitching for Seattle in 2018, winning all four of his starts with a 2.05 ERA. He'd allowed just one home run over seven career starts at Minute Maid Park before Altuve took him deep twice. Paxton surrendered three additional extra-base hits, including an RBI triple to Yuli Gurriel in the first inning and an RBI double to Carlos Correa in the third.
Cardinals 7, Dodgers 2
Jack Flaherty allowed one run and three hits in six innings, and St. Louis extended its winning streak to four with a victory against visiting Los Angeles.
Flaherty (1-0) struck out eight and did not walk a batter. Yadier Molina and Marcell Ozuna hit two-run homers. Ozuna also singled and doubled, and Paul DeJong also had three hits, three runs and an RBI for St. Louis.
Kenta Maeda (2-1) allowed five runs and seven hits in 5 1/3 innings for the Dodgers, who have lost three in a row following a five-game winning streak. Joc Pederson and Max Muncy hit solo home runs for Los Angeles.
Pirates 5, Cubs 2
Francisco Cervelli and Starling Marte each belted home runs, Jordan Lyles notched 10 strikeouts in a quality start, and Pittsburgh pulled away for the victory at Chicago.
Josh Bell also drove in a run for Pittsburgh, which evened the three-game series at one game apiece. Marte, Cervelli, Bell and Erik Gonzalez had two hits each on a cold, blustery night along Lake Michigan with temperatures dropping into the 30s.
Jason Heyward went 3-for-4 with a home run to lead the Cubs. Chicago has lost eight of 11 games this season.
Nationals 15, Phillies 1
Anthony Rendon continued his torrid hitting with two hits and three RBIs, and Matt Adams had two hits and four RBIs as visiting Washington scored three runs in the first and kept going, routing Philadelphia.
The Nationals took two of three in the series with the Phillies after winning two of three in New York against the Mets.
Jeremy Hellickson (1-0) pitched six scoreless innings against his former team and allowed just three hits. Rendon has now hit in 10 games in a row and has an extra-base hit in eight straight, the longest active mark in the majors.
Mets 9, Twins 6
Noah Syndergaard tossed seven-plus strong innings, Michael Conforto drove in three runs, and host New York benefited from unconventional offense to post the victory over Minnesota.
Conforto and Wilson Ramos each had a two-run single and Jeff McNeil added an RBI single for the Mets, who plated their first four runs via a hit batsman and three walks with the bases loaded.
Syndergaard (1-1) allowed just one run through the first seven innings, but he wound up charged with four runs on five hits. He struck out seven without issuing a walk.
A's 10, Orioles 3
Khris Davis homered twice, including the 200th of his career, leading a five-homer attack for Oakland in a victory at Baltimore.
Davis finished the night 3-for-5 with four RBIs. He homered in the fifth and seventh innings, his 23rd multi-homer game. The second homer was No. 200 and his seventh in Oakland's first 16 games this season.
Matt Chapman, Jurickson Profar and Chad Pinder also each went deep for the A's. Chapman and Davis hit back-to-back homers in the seventh, the first time Oakland has done that this season.
Reds 2, Marlins 1
Jose Iglesias and Jesse Winker hit solo homers in the eighth inning as Cincinnati rallied to defeat visiting Miami.
Both homers were hit off Drew Steckenrider (0-2), who was taken deep both times on fastballs to the opposite field. Iglesias' shot, his first of the season, went 391 feet to right-center. Winker's blow, his second, traveled 358 feet to left.
The Marlins, who were shut out by the Reds 14-0 on Tuesday, managed a Neil Walker home run. Walker's long ball, his second of the year, gave Miami the lead in the third inning, and it held up until Cincinnati's late power surge.
Padres 3, Giants 1
Manny Machado cleared the right field wall for a tiebreaking home run, and San Diego's bullpen preserved the lead, delivering the victory over host San Francisco to win the three-game series.
Rookie Nick Margevicius (1-1) recorded his first major league win with six innings of one-run ball and aided his own cause with a sacrifice bunt that helped produce a run. The Padres beat the Giants for the fifth time in seven meetings this season.
The teams traded runs before Machado's high fly to right field with one out in the sixth made it over the top of Oracle Park's 20-foot brick wall near the right field foul pole, giving the Padres a lead they never relinquished.
Rays 9, White Sox 1
Tommy Pham homered twice to back a combined six-hitter from Tyler Glasnow and Jalen Beeks and lift Tampa Bay to the victory against host Chicago, capping a sweep of the three-game series.
The surging Rays have won four successive series to open a season for the first time in franchise history and boast victories in 10 of 13 games overall.
Austin Meadows had three hits and three RBIs, and Avisail Garcia added three hits and two RBIs for the Rays in his return to Chicago. Garcia, a member of the White Sox from 2013-18, went 8-for-15 with a home run and four RBIs in the series.
Tigers 4, Indians 1
Niko Goodrum blasted a two-run homer in the first, Matthew Boyd tossed six strong innings, and host Detroit cooled off Cleveland.
John Hicks also homered for Detroit, which has won six of its past seven games. Goodrum, Hicks, Miguel Cabrera and Dustin Peterson had two hits apiece.
Boyd (1-1) gave up one run on four hits, striking out six and walking two. Shane Greene recorded his eighth save in as many opportunities by getting the last three outs, snapping Cleveland's five-game winning streak.
Rangers 5, Diamondbacks 2
The Texas offense recovered after five no-hit innings from Arizona's Robbie Ray, and the bullpen held on to support a strong outing from Lance Lynn in a victory at Phoenix.
Lynn (1-1) allowed one run and four hits in six innings, striking out nine and walking two. The right-hander improved to 6-0 in 10 career starts against the Diamondbacks.
Texas closer Jose Leclerc, who coughed up a 4-2 lead in the ninth Tuesday in a 5-4 loss, got into more trouble when he walked in a run in the ninth. Kyle Bird came on to close out the victory for his first save.
Braves at Rockies, ppd.
The scheduled game between Atlanta and Colorado was postponed due to a blizzard warning in Denver. The contest was rescheduled for Aug. 26.

(Reuters) - Britain's Tara Moore stared the dreaded 'double bagel' in the face as she trailed 0-6 0-5 30-40 to French third seed Jessika Ponchet in this week's ITF World Tour event in Sunderland and could have been excused for wanting the ground to open up.
Instead, she produced a great sporting comeback -- recovering to win from a seemingly impossible position.
Languishing at nearly 500 in the WTA rankings, Moore saved the match point with a smash that skimmed the net tape before landing on the line -- then set about clawing her way back into contention before winning 0-6 7-6 6-3.
""Never in doubt"" the 26-year-old, who reached the second round of Wimbledon in 2016, said on social media.
Tennis has seen many great comebacks in the past.
Andre Agassi won the 1999 French Open final against Andrei Medvedev after winning only three games in the first two sets.
Before that in 1987 his fellow American Jimmy Connors, aged 34, trailed Swede Mikael Pernfors 6-1 6-1 4-1 at Wimbledon before pulling off a remarkable victory.
This year Czech Karolina Pliskova trailed 5-1 in the final set of her Australian Open quarter-final against Serena Williams, but won the last six games to triumph.
While Moore's snatching of victory from the jaws of defeat perhaps surpasses those, American Lisa Raymond went one better at the 2004 French Open.
She trailed 6-0 5-0 and faced two match points against Czech Ľubomira Kurhajcova before winning 0-6 7-5 6-3.

DALLAS — Tyler Seguin broke open a scoreless game with two third-period goals, and the Dallas Stars beat the Minnesota Wild 3-0 to take the Western Conference's top wild-card spot Saturday night.
Ben Bishop made 22 saves for his career-high seventh shutout of the season, and Tyler Pitlick also scored for the Stars. Dallas will open the postseason against Nashville.
Seguin scored the first goal on the power play with 17:16 to play. He took a pass from Alexander Radulov high in the left faceoff circle and sent a slap shot over Minnesota's Alex Stalock and into the upper-left corner of the net.
The Wild had stopped 22 straight power plays over nine games.
For the second goal, Seguin's team-high 33rd of the season, he took the rebound of a shot by Jamie Oleksiak in front and backhanded the puck past Stalock six minutes later.
Pitlick scored off another rebound with 7:59 remaining.
Bishop recorded the 31st shutout of his career. He finished the season with career bests in save percentage (a league-leading .934) and goals against average (1.98).
Stalock was far busier, stopping 41 shots.
Dallas came up empty during a scoreless first period despite a 14-7 advantage in shots on goal. Each team had one unsuccessful power play. The Stars also led in shots with the man advantage, 4-0.
In the scoreless second period, Dallas had an even bigger advantage in shots at 20-5, but only the Wild put the puck in the net. Stars coach Jim Montgomery challenged Greg Pateryn's slap shot from the blue line that went past Bishop 18 seconds before intermission. The video review showed that Minnesota was offside on that possession.
Stalock turned away good chances by Jamie Benn and Alexander Radulov, a 2-on-1 break by Seguin and Andrew Cogliano and a flurry of shots with two minutes left in the period.
Bishop stopped a close-range shot by Kevin Fiala during the final minute.
Wild defenseman Nick Seeler and Dallas center Radek Faksa energized the second period with two scuffles. They were penalized for roughing at 7:05. After leaving the penalty box, they went back right back in for fighting at 9:11.
NOTES: Fiala had the unusual distinction of playing in 83 games this season - 64 for Nashville, with another 19 after being traded to the Wild. Playing in all 82 games were Minnesota's Marcus Foligno, Ryan Suter, Jonas Brodin and Jared Spurgeon, and the Stars' Miro Heiskanen, Esa Lindell and Tyler Seguin. Marcus Pettersson played in 83 contests for Anaheim and Pittsburgh. ... Minnesota LW Zach Parise (illness) missed the season's final two games. ... Dallas successfully killed 15 of 16 penalties in the final six games.
UP NEXT
Wild: Can look forward to June 21, the first day of the NHL Entry Draft in Vancouver.
Stars: Begin the Stanley Cup playoffs at Nashville. Dallas was 2-0-1 on the Predators' home ice this season.

LUBBOCK, Tex. — Although Texas Tech’s dazzling quest for a national championship in men’s basketball came to an end in Minneapolis on Monday night, fans who had shared the unlikely ride were already looking to the future.
“We’re going to get it done by the time I graduate,” said Christopher Rodriguez, an 18-year-old freshman from Houston, as he and more than 5,500 other fans spilled out of United Supermarkets Arena in Lubbock, Tex., where they had gathered to watch the game.
They endured an emotional roller coaster, as the Red Raiders repeatedly seemed within reach of their first N.C.A.A. title before eventually
falling to the Virginia Cavaliers, 85-77, in overtime
.
The Lubbock police had beefed up their presence around campus and closed off major streets, fearing a repeat of the rowdy behavior that followed Texas Tech’s
semifinal victory over Michigan State
on Saturday. That night, people tipped over cars, set fire to a couch and committed other acts that Police Chief Gregory Stevens has said will result in charges of arson, criminal mischief and rioting.
But the streets were quieter on Monday, whether because of the expanded police presence or simply because defeat had left Raider Nation subdued.
Despite the loss, fans took pride in a season that had taken their team to the pinnacle of college basketball. More people made the trip to Minneapolis for the final than watched the game from the arena in Lubbock.
“I’ve been waiting since 1961, and I would have hitchhiked if I had to,” Kent Hance, a Texas Tech graduate and former chancellor, said by telephone from Minneapolis a few hours before the game.
Officials in Lubbock, the metropolitan center of an agrarian region in northwestern Texas, were happy about the national exposure.
“If you mention Lubbock, there’s a better chance of them recognizing where Lubbock is and what we stand for as a result of the success of the team,” said John Osborne, president and chief executive of the city’s Economic Development Alliance.
Mayor Dan Pope, a Texas Tech alumnus (like his parents), said the city’s economic team had determined that 5,540 articles were published about Lubbock and the university around the tournament, which they said was worth $44 million in advertising. “It’s had a huge impact,” he said.
Fans’ devotion soared to fever pitch as the final game approached. Long lines snaked outside Red Raider Outfitter in southeastern Lubbock. Katie Hartman, the store’s lead buyer, said people had started arriving at 7 a.m. hoping to get special championship game T-shirts. Sales volume was “the largest we’ve ever seen,” she said.
After the game, Chris Cook, the university’s communications director, tried to put the loss in perspective, noting that of 68 teams in the tournament, Texas Tech was one of the last two standing.
“A lot of people would have liked to be in our shoes,” he said.

MONTREAL — Ryan Poehling recorded a hat trick and added the shootout winner in his NHL debut as the Montreal Canadiens beat the Toronto Maple Leafs 6-5 Saturday in the regular-season finale for both teams.
Jordan Weal and Andrew Shaw also scored for the Canadiens (44-30-8), who were eliminated from playoff contention Friday night.
Goalie Charlie Lindgren, in his first game of the season, stopped 44 of 49 shots. Lindgren filled in for Carey Price, who had started the previous 13 games.
Price ended the season with a 35-24-6 record and a .918 save percentage.
Zach Hyman, Jake Gardiner, Trevor Moore, William Nylander and Kasperi Kapanen scored for the Maple Leafs (46-28-8), who will face the Boston Bruins in the first round of the playoffs. Frederik Andersen stopped 44 of 49 shots.
Poehling scored the shootout winner on Montreal's fourth shot, after John Tavares failed to win it for Toronto. The American-born Poehling, Montreal's first pick (25th overall) in the 2017 draft, recently completed his third NCAA season at St. Cloud State.
The shots were 49-49 after overtime — a Canadiens' record for combined shots in a game.
Montreal became the last team eliminated from playoff contention on Friday when the Columbus Blue Jackets beat the New York Rangers 3-2 in a shootout. The Canadiens have missed the playoffs in back-to-back seasons for the first time since 2001.
Toronto jumped to a 2-0 lead in the first period. Hyman's no-look shot went off Shea Weber's skate and into the net at 5:50. Gardiner's shot from the point was deflected by Brendan Gallagher at 8:03.
Poehling scored his first NHL goal on his fourth shift, at 11:41, going hard to the net and ramming the puck past Andersen.
Poehling, a native of Lakeville, Minnesota, scored his second of the game to make it 2-2 on an easy tap-in at 2:56 of the second period.
Poehling, who signed three-year entry-level deal last Sunday, became the fifth Canadiens player in franchise history to score at least two goals in his NHL debut. He's the first to do it since John Ferguson in 1963, and the first to record a hat trick since Alex Smart in 1943.
Montreal grabbed its first lead of the game when Weal scored a power-play goal at 7:04 of the second.
Toronto tied it less than two minutes later on Moore's second of the season on a partial breakaway.
Shaw gave the Canadiens a 4-3 lead when he completed a give-and-go with Max Domi and Artturi Lehkonen at 10:17.
Nylander made it 4-4 at 17:33 of the second on a wraparound after Lindgren overcommitted to his left.
With 11:56 left to play in a 4-4 game, the Leafs broke the deadlock when Auston Matthews found Kapanen alone in the slot for the winner.
Poehling completed his hat trick with 2:31 left.
NOTES: With an eye toward the playoffs, Toronto rested four of its top defensemen: Ron Hainsey, Jake Muzzin, Nikita Zaitsev and Travis Dermott. ... Legendary broadcaster Bob Cole called his final game after a 50-year career. . Canadiens defenseman Paul Byron was out with a wrist injury. . The Canadiens will clean out their lockers on Tuesday.

Dwyane Wade ended his storied career with a triple-double of 25 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists Wednesday night as the visiting Miami Heat were dealt a 113-94 loss to the Brooklyn Nets, who clinched sixth place in the Eastern Conference.
The Nets honored Wade with a video tribute in pregame introductions by highlighting some of his notable shots against them over the course of a 16-year career while the text on the screen read ""Thanks for the Memories.""
With longtime friends LeBron James, Chris Paul and Carmelo Anthony sitting courtside, Wade recorded his fifth career triple-double in his 1,054th regular-season game since entering the league as the fifth overall pick out of Marquette in 2003.
Wade played 36 minutes and received a loud hand from fans each time he touched the ball. He made 10 of 28 shots, and his last points were a 3-pointer with 2:48 remaining.
Wade exited the court for the last time with 10 seconds remaining. Before leaving the court, he embraced teammates on the floor, then hugged coach Erik Spoelstra and waved to the crowd.
After the final buzzer, Wade exchanged hugs at midcourt with Anthony, James, and Paul and posed with pictures with his longtime friends. He then gave his jersey to Anthony.
Appropriately, Wade reached his first triple-double since Jan. 13, 2006, by connecting with longtime teammate Udonis Haslem for a jumper in the final minute of the third quarter.
Brooklyn (42-40) secured the sixth seed and will open its first postseason series since 2014-15 this weekend in Philadelphia. The Nets also clinched their first winning season since 2013-14 by going 34-22 over their last 56 games since Dec. 7.
D'Angelo Russell, who ended his rookie season by appearing in Kobe Bryant's last game in 2016 with the Los Angeles Lakers, led the Nets with 21 points.
After Brooklyn took a 63-47 lead into halftime, Russell hit four three 3-pointers in the first two minutes of the third quarter, including three in a span of 46 seconds, as the Nets extended their lead to 75-50. Brooklyn brought a 92-71 edge into the fourth.
Miami opened the fourth on a 13-5 run and was within 97-84 when Wade re-entered the game with 7:20 left.

HOUSTON — The Yankees will be without Luis Severino, their staff ace, until some time this summer, after it was revealed Tuesday that he strained a right latissimus dorsi muscle while
returning from an injured throwing shoulder
.
The Yankees announced the results of Severino’s latest magnetic resonance imaging examination before Tuesday’s mistake-filled 6-3 loss to the Houston Astros. The team said Severino would be unable to throw for six weeks.
This latest injury — a Grade 2 strain on a scale of three — occurred some time after an examination in early March revealed that Severino, 25, had inflammation in the rotator cuff in his right shoulder, a team spokesman said.
The latissimus dorsi is a muscle in the back that stretches roughly from the armpit to the hip.
Severino’s rehabilitation from his shoulder injury was stalled when he reported not feeling “as great” as before during long tosses on flat ground over the weekend at the team’s spring training facility in Tampa, Fla. He had not been able to graduate to the next step in his return — throwing off a mound — which led the Yankees to send Severino to New York to be evaluated by the their head doctor on Tuesday.
Severino, a two-time All-Star, was already one of the major-league-leading 11 Yankees on the injured list. But the latest blow means they will be without Severino even longer than expected; he was originally slated to return from the shoulder injury sometime in May.
The Yankees expect C. C. Sabathia, who had off-season surgeries on his heart and knee, to return from the I.L. this weekend. Domingo German and Jonathan Loaisiga have filled the void in the rotation in the meantime.
German has pitched well in his two starts, but Loaisiga surrendered two runs and four hits in 71 pitches over three innings in Tuesday’s loss. His command was shaky and the Astros squared up his offerings. After the game, Loaisiga was demoted to Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.
The Yankees have not played consistently clean baseball so far this season, a flaw that was apparent again Tuesday. Brett Gardner bunted into a double play in the third inning. He stopped running to first base, thinking the ball was foul, and then Austin Romine was thrown out at second base.
“I basically gave them two outs right there,” Gardner said. “I thought it was a big turning point in the game. A big mistake on my part.”
The Astros tied the game in the seventh inning partly because Yankees left fielder Clint Frazier, for the second time of the night, dived for a ball and missed. The ball, hit by Alex Bregman, smacked off Frazier’s glove. Frazier punched the ground in disgust and then chased after the ball. The next batter, Michael Brantley, doubled off reliever Jonathan Holder to tie the score at 3-3.
“I don’t really have an explanation for that one,” Frazier said. “It’s never happened, and it popped out of my glove twice tonight. It’s never an easy play when you leave your feet, but it’s not an excuse. I should have caught both of those balls.”
In a calamitous eighth inning, reliever Chad Green coughed up a two-run double to George Springer. It could have been a three-run hit if Tony Kemp had not tripped between third base and home. The Yankees couldn’t catch him in a rundown. Kemp later scored on a sacrifice fly by Jose Altuve.
If Severino resumes throwing in six weeks, around late May, he could be unavailable until at least late June. it often takes at least a month for starting pitchers to go through a throwing program that begins from scratch and eventually progresses to multiple minor league rehabilitation starts.
The Yankees did not provide a public timeline beyond the six-week shutdown. Although the grades of the strains were not publicly known and were likely of varying degrees, Steven Matz of the Mets missed two months with a torn latissimus dorsi on his throwing side in 2015 while Noah Syndergaard missed five months with one on his throwing side in 2017.

PITTSBURGH — Ryan Strome scored 2:09 into overtime and the New York Rangers beat the Pittsburgh Penguins 4-3 Saturday night in the regular-season finale.
Brendan Smith, Brady Skjei and Vladislav Namestnikov also scored for New York, long eliminated from playoff contention for the second straight year. Alexandar Georgiev stopped 36 shots while starting for the second straight night. The Rangers snapped a three-game skid and won for just the fifth time in their final 21 games (5-10-6).
Sidney Crosby, Nick Bjugstad and Jake Guentzel scored for the Penguins, who earned a point to secure third-place in the Metropolitan Division and a matchup with the New York Islanders in the first round of the playoffs. Matt Murray finished with 26 saves while starting g20 of Pittsburgh's last 21 games.
Skjei and Namestnikov scored 1:16 apart to give the Rangers a 3-2 lead with 6:10 remaining in regulation. Namestnikov's go-ahead goal was the 15th short-handed score allowed by Pittsburgh, tied for worst in the league.
However, Guentzel tied it with his 40th of the season with 2:35 to play, becoming the 20th player in franchise history to reach the mark. Crosby, who scored his 35th earlier in the game, had an assist on the play for his 100th point. Crosby reached the mark for the sixth time in his career, and first time since 2013-14.
Crosby opened the scoring at 6:36 of the first period when he converted a one-timer from Guentzel during a 2-on-1.
Smith tied it with 7:11 left in the opening period as he beat Murray on a partial breakaway following a turnover by Garrett Wilson at center ice.
Bjugstad put Pittsburgh in front 2-1 at 2:28 of the third. Marcus Pettersson's point shot deflected off the stick of Patric Hornqvist and went to Bjugstad, who put the puck in near the left post for his 14th.
Skjei tied it with 7:26 to play when he beat Murray with a wrist shot from the slot during a 3-on-2 for his eighth.
NOTES: Pittsburgh recorded 100 points for the 10th time in the last 12 full seasons. ... Penguins D Brian Dumoulin missed his third straight game, but he skated Saturday morning. ...

A Texas woman has sued the Houston Astros for more than $1 million, contending her left index finger was injured permanently last summer when the team mascot shot a giveaway shirt in her direction using a ""T-shirt cannon.""
Jennifer Harughty said she was sitting behind third base last July 8 when the mascot, Orbit, launched a T-shirt at close range, resulting in a broken finger.
""It was a life-changing event that I think if it happened to anybody else ... they would feel the same way,"" Harughty told KTRK-TV in Houston.
According to the lawsuit, which was filed Monday, Harughty went to the emergency room after the game and was diagnosed with a severe fracture and told she would need surgery.
Four days later, she had surgery with two screws placed in her finger. Two months later, she underwent a second surgery. According to the lawsuit, Harughty has little to no use of her finger, despite physical therapy.
She is seeking more than $1 million for pain and suffering and wants a jury trial. She said the team is negligent for failing to properly train staff to use the device and for not warning fans of its dangers.
The Astros released a statement on Tuesday.
""The Astros are aware of the lawsuit with allegations regarding Orbit's T-shirt launcher,"" the statement said. ""We do not agree with the allegations. The Astros will continue to use fan popular T-shirt launchers during games.
""As this is an ongoing legal matter, we will have no further comment on this matter.""

The Washington Nationals reached an agreement Tuesday with right-handed reliever Bud Norris on a minor league deal, pending results of a physical, according to The Athletic.
Norris, 34, spent spring training with the Toronto Blue Jays, posting a 9.00 ERA in three innings of work before injuring his forearm and getting released on April 2.
Norris spent the 2018 season in the St. Louis Cardinals' bullpen, going 3-6 with 28 saves and a 3.59 ERA in 64 appearances.
In 10 seasons with seven teams, Norris is 67-90 with 47 saves, a 4.45 ERA and 1,153 strikeouts in 1,221 1/3 innings.
While pitching for the Houston Astros on April 24, 2012, Norris tied a major league record by striking out four batters in one inning against the Milwaukee Brewers.

AUGUSTA, Ga. — The fifth hole at Augusta National is certainly not the most famous, but this year it could be the hardest after being stretched so far that they had to reroute the road that ran behind the old tee.
The par-four has been turned into a brute, lengthened some 40 yards to nearly 500 yards, officially 495 though the number will change slightly each day depending on where the pin is put.
The tees will also likely be moved a few yards each day.
""I think number five is probably going to play the toughest hole now for sure,"" said world number one Justin Rose.
The hole, which curves gently to the left without being a dogleg, still has two deep bunkers guarding the left-hand side, encouraging players to aim more for the right side of the fairway.
Rory McIlroy, perhaps the longest hitter in the field, used to worry about his ball running through the fairway and into bushes on the right, and often used a three-wood off the tee for safety instead of a driver.
Now he can swing away without fear.
""I think (hole) five has been a very good change in terms (that) it puts driver back in a lot of guys' hands that wouldn't necessarily hit driver on that hole,"" said the Northern Irishman.
""And you need to hit driver; because I came here last Wednesday, played in the morning, it was a little cold, a little damp and I hit four-iron into the green.
""If you hit three-wood and you're 30 yards back of (where driver would stop) you're on the upslope and you can hardly see the green.""
Tiger Woods succinctly summed up the new hole.
""It's just long,"" he said on Wednesday. ""The bunkers are still deep. I think they are unplayable to get the ball to the green.""
The hole was parred more than two-thirds of the time in 2018, when it yielded only 26 birdies all week, along with 64 bogeys and four double-bogeys.
It was the sixth hardest of the week.
It is likely to give up even fewer birdies this week, but a lot more bogeys.
""I always like making hard holes harder,"" said three-times Masters champion Phil Mickelson.
For the shorter hitters, the game plan has not really changed.
""The tee shot is pretty much the same shot,"" said British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who is not a particularly long hitter.
""The second shot, obviously is longer, considerably longer. Yesterday it was playing into the wind, and probably with the old tee we would have been hitting seven-iron in, and we were hitting four-iron in yesterday.
""I think that's going to be around a three-club difference.""

Josh Bailey scored on a rebound at 4:39 of overtime and the Islanders beat the Pittsburgh Penguins, 4-3, at Nassau Coliseum on Wednesday night in the opener of their Eastern Conference first-round playoff series.
Jordan Eberle had a goal and an assist, and Brock Nelson and Nick Leddy also scored for the Islanders, who were opening a postseason series at home for the first time in 31 years. Robin Lehner stopped 41 shots.
Phil Kessel and Evgeni Malkin each had a goal and an assist, and Justin Schultz also scored for the Penguins. Matt Murray finished with 29 saves.
On the winning goal, Matt Barzal brought the puck into the offensive zone on a 2-on-1 break, faked in front to draw Murray out and sent a backhand shot that bounced off the left post, but Bailey was there to knock it in.
Game 2 is Friday night.
Tom Kuhnhackl, who had a goal in the opening minute of the game waved off for offsides, nearly won it for the Islanders 1:12 into the extra period as he crashed into Murray and the puck crossed the goal line. But a replay confirmed that the net had first come loose.
The Islanders led three times in regulation, but the Penguins tied it each time.
Leddy gave the Islanders a 3-2 lead with 7:25 left in the third as he sent a long shot from left point at the blue line that knuckled past Murray.
With Murray pulled for an extra skater, Schultz fired a one-timer from the left circle past Lehner inside the left post with 1:29 left.
Bailey had a chance to win it in the closing seconds of the third, but his shot hit the right post. Matt Martin also hit a post for the Islanders.
The raucous crowd was chanting “Let’s Go Islanders!” even before the teams came out for pregame warm-ups, and it roared when the Islanders stepped on the ice and then booed loudly when the Penguins followed.
BLUE JACKETS 4, LIGHTNING 3
Seth Jones scored the go-ahead goal on the power play to cap a three-goal rally in the third period for visiting Columbus in Game 1 of their Eastern Conference series.
“We can’t get comfortable,” Jones said. “Nothing is going to get easier. It’s only going to get harder.”
Tampa Bay led 3-0 after the first period and 3-1 in the third.
“Our mentality was, we wanted to outscore them tonight instead of build a lead and then shut then down,” Lightning Coach Jon Cooper said. “Our mentality has to be when we get in these situations is shut teams down, not to add to the lead.”
Tampa Bay scored 325 goals in 2018-19, the most by any team in 23 years.
But Columbus’s David Savard deked around Lightning defenseman Victor Hedman and scored 7:56 into the period to make it a one-goal game, and then Josh Anderson tied it with a short-handed goal at 11:54.
Six minutes later, Jones made it 4-3 with a shot from the slot.
The Lightning, who matched the 1995-96 Red Wings for the most wins in a regular season with 62, got first-period goals from Alex Killorn, Anthony Cirelli and Yanni Gourde.
“We’re just losing too many battles,” Blue Jackets Coach John Tortorella said. “Just the grind of the game. We have to be able to grind with them.”
BLUES 2, JETS 1
Tyler Bozak scored with 2:05 left in the third period as visiting St. Louis took Game 1 of their Western Conference opening-round series.
Pat Maroon sent a backhand pass from behind the net out to Bozak in the slot, and Bozak’s quick shot went by Winnipeg’s Connor Hellebuyck. David Perron also scored for St. Louis in the third, and Jordan Binnington made 24 saves.
Patrik Laine scored late in the first period and Hellebuyck stopped 24 shots for the Jets, who host Game 2 on Friday.

The New York Giants have re-signed wide receiver Russell Shepard to a one-year deal, according to multiple reports.
The 28-year-old wideout confirmed the news on social media.
""EXTREMELY happy to be back with the GANG!!!!"" Shepard posted Wednesday on Instagram, along with the hashtag #BigBLUE.
Shepard appeared in 12 games in his first season with the Giants in 2018, playing primarily on special teams and catching 10 passes for 188 yards and two touchdowns.
Undrafted out of LSU, he spent four seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (2013-16) and one with the Carolina Panthers (2017). He has 57 catches for 822 yards and six scores in 84 career games.
Shepard could be in line for a bigger role in the New York offense in 2019 following the offseason trade of Odell Beckham Jr. to the Cleveland Browns.
Terms were not disclosed. Shepard earned a base salary of $1.25 million with incentives up to $700,000 last season, per Spotrac.com.

Dwyane Wade was hoping to extend his legendary career into at least four postseason games.
Instead, Wade's career will end Wednesday night when the Heat visit the playoff-bound Brooklyn Nets, who can clinch the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference.
Wade, 37, announced his retirement on Sept 16 before training camp began, and this season has been a farewell tour filled with a few magical moments and some postgame jersey exchanges.
Despite the good feelings of celebrating Wade's storied career, which began as the No. 5 overall draft pick in 2003 and includes NBA championships in 2006, 2012 and 2013, the Heat were unable to do enough to reach the postseason this year.
Miami was formally eliminated Tuesday night as Wade's career was celebrated in front of home fans for the final time. Wade scored 30 points in his first start of the season in a 122-99 rout of the Philadelphia 76ers, exited to a standing ovation in the final minute and exchanged jerseys with Jimmy Butler.
""I'm still just amazed, even after all these years,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""I've seen him go into his bag of tricks so many times and just compartmentalize. But I'm truly amazed that he was able to perform like that tonight.""
Wade's final moments in front of the home fans occurred after the Detroit Pistons (40-41) stormed back from a 22-point deficit to beat the Memphis Grizzlies and eliminate the Heat (39-42).
Miami will miss the postseason for the third time in five seasons since LeBron James returned to Cleveland in 2014.
The Heat were one game over .500 three times but only reached the .500 mark once since Jan. 27 and were done in by losing four straight before Tuesday.
Brooklyn (41-40) will face either third-seeded Philadelphia or second-seeded Toronto in the first round of the playoffs. The Nets are even with Orlando but own the head-the-head tiebreaker and would finish sixth with a win or if the Magic lose Wednesday at Charlotte.
The Nets are in this position because of what unfolded in a challenging road back-to-back set. After getting a five-point win at Milwaukee on Saturday, Brooklyn led most of the way and celebrated clinching a playoff berth with a 108-96 victory at Indiana on Sunday.
""To be honest, it is a big moment for us and a big moment for the organization, from where we've come from in the last couple of years, the improvement that we've had individually and collectively,"" Nets guard Joe Harris said at practice Tuesday. ""Just to clinch a playoff spot, it's a big moment for the organization for sure, and we're all very happy. But at the same time, we still have Miami left to finish out the year the right way, and we still want to make some noise in the playoffs and make it competitive.""
By clinching Sunday, the Nets are in a position to rest players, and two may be out. DeMarre Carroll will sit out due to a sprained right wrist while Harris -- who leads the NBA in 3-point shooting percentage -- is questionable because of a sore right foot.

(Reuters) - The New York Yankees are Major League Baseball's most valuable team for a 22nd consecutive year, according to the annual list published by business magazine Forbes.
The 27-time World Series champion, which has held the top spot since Forbes began tracking MLB team finances in 1998, is worth $4.6 billion, the publisher said in a statement on Wednesday.
The figure is up 15 percent from a year ago and more than double the league's average value.
The Los Angeles Dodgers ($3.3 billion), reigning World Series champion Boston Red Sox ($3.2 billion), Chicago Cubs ($3.1 billion) and San Francisco Giants ($3 billion) rounded out the top five.
The average MLB team is now worth $1.8 billion, an 8 percent increase from last year, due in large part to a continued escalation in the value of the sport's media rights.
""The fact that Fox has agreed to pay almost 50 percent more for its national media deal with MLB beginning with the 2022 season shows that baseball content has significantly increased in value,"" said Mike Ozanian, assistant managing editor at Forbes.

HOUSTON — Michael Brantley broke out of a slump with two hits, including a two-run homer, and George Springer added a two-run shot of his own to power the Houston Astros to a 6-0 victory over the Oakland Athletics on Saturday night.
Wade Miley (1-1) allowed four hits in 5 2/3 innings to win his home debut for Houston after losing his first start this season at Tampa Bay. Will Harris got the last out of the sixth and Josh James, Chris Devenski and Framber Valdez pitched one inning apiece to complete the six-hitter.
The Astros were up 1-0 with nobody out in the fifth when Springer launched a 90 mph fastball from Aaron Brooks (1-1) into the left field seats. Alex Bregman singled with one out before Brantley's homer sailed to the second deck in right to make it 5-0.
Brantley, in his first year with the Astros after spending 10 seasons with the Indians, snapped an 0-for-13 skid and got his first hit in a week with a single to start the fourth. Yuli Gurriel's double with one out, over leaping third baseman Matt Chapman, scored Brantley to make it 1-0.
Gurriel also doubled in the second and eighth to give him a career-best three in the game.
Brooks yielded nine hits and five runs in five innings after pitching six scoreless innings during his first start this year in a win over Boston.
Robinson Chirinos added a solo homer in the sixth to help Houston win its second straight game after losing the previous two.
The Athletics went 0 for 5 with runners in scoring position and left nine on base overall as they were shut out a night after losing 3-2 in the series opener.
Miley didn't allow more than one runner in an inning until the fourth when Stephen Piscotty singled with no outs and Kendrys Morales walked with two outs. But the Athletics came away empty-handed when Mark Canha grounded out.
Miley was replaced after a single by Chad Pinder left runners on first and second with two outs in the sixth. Harris took over and struck out Morales to end the threat.

Athletics: RHP Mike Fiers (2-1, 3.00 ERA), who threw a no-hitter for Houston in 2015, will pitch Sunday. Fiers has not allowed a run in his last two starts spanning 12 innings and got the win against the Red Sox in his last outing when he permitted five hits and struck out three in six innings.
Astros: RHP Brad Peacock (1-0, 1.35) is scheduled to start for Houston in the series finale after allowing two hits and one run in 6 2/3 innings to beat Texas his last time out.

LONDON — Tottenham Hotspur's elation at beating Manchester City 1-0 in their Champions League quarter-final first leg on Tuesday was somewhat overshadowed by the prospect of a potential season-ending injury for Harry Kane.
Kane, who has scored 24 goals this season, rolled his ankle painfully just before the hour mark after a hefty tackle on City defender Fabian Delph.
The England striker left the field immediately and looks a major doubt for next week's second leg in Manchester.
He could even miss the run-in to Tottenham's season, having already had a lengthy spell on the sidelines with an injury to the same ankle in January when he damaged ligaments.
""We are very sad and disappointed. We are going to miss him, maybe for the rest of the season, and we are worried about that. He doesn't have much time to recover,"" Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino told reporters.
""We'll see in the next few days. We can only look forward and hope it's not a big issue and that he can recover as soon as possible, but it doesn't look good.""
Pochettino exchanged angry words with Delph after the incident, in which the City player appeared to stand on Kane's ankle as the pair tussled for the ball.
""He was so aggressive with Harry after the action,"" Pochettino said. ""I tried to explain to him that it wasn't the intention of Harry or him to damage each other, it was a tough action, and Harry twisted his ankle.
""I said to Delph, 'You were lucky', because they were checking the VAR and technically it could have been a red card. But I think both were fighting for the ball.""
SON SHINES
Son Heung-min, who scored goals in the four successive matches in which Kane was missing earlier in the season, rose to the occasion again to seal a crucial win for Tottenham with his 18th club goal of the season in all competitions.
The livewire South Korean cut in from the byline in the 78th minute and fired a shot past Ederson to give Tottenham a slender advantage to protect at The Etihad Stadium next week, the second of three games in 10 days between the two clubs.
Tottenham showed great discipline to shackle a City side who surprisingly left Kevin de Bruyne on the bench until the 89th minute, but Pochettino still reckons his side are underdogs to reach their first Champions League semi-final.
""It was so tough,"" he said. ""I am happy but Manchester City are still favourites. We showed great quality and the performance was good but there are still 90 minutes to play.""
City will need to overturn a curious statistic if they are to keep alive their hopes of an unprecedented quadruple.
They have now lost all five of their European matches against English opponents, including both legs of last year's quarter-final against Premier League title rivals Liverpool.
City have also not won a European tie on aggregate after an away first-leg loss since beating Gornik Zabrze in the 1970/71 European Cup Winners' Cup quarter-finals.
On that occasion they needed a replay, after each side won 2-0 at home, as they went through 3-1 in the third game.

AUGUSTA Ga. (Reuters) - Rory McIlroy's desire to complete his collection of golf's four majors with a win at this week's Masters has led the Northern Irishman to try a fresh approach, one that focuses on meditation and juggling.
McIlroy enters the year's first major as the hottest player on the planet and he credits his solid start to 2019 with a new attitude that is all about perspective, persistence and poise, or what he refers to as the three P's.
The new formula for McIlroy, who will play the opening two rounds this week with American Rickie Fowler and Australia's Cameron Smith, centres around meditation, juggling and mind training.
""Look, I'm not going to go and live with the monks for a couple months in Nepal, but just to be able to get your mind in the right place and be able to focus and to centre yourself,"" McIlroy told a news conference at Augusta National on Tuesday.
""It's 10 minutes a day. It's not as if I'm being consumed by it. But definitely something that has helped from time to time. Especially in situations where you need your mind to be right.""
McIlroy has five consecutive top-10 finishes at the Masters yet his defining moment at Augusta National remains his final-round collapse in 2011 when he failed to close out the win despite entering the day with a four-shot lead.
But McIlroy, who has since gone on to win four times at golf's three other majors, has visions of becoming just the sixth person to complete the career grand slam and hopes his new approach will prove fruitful.
The 29-year-old Northern Irishman has a top-six finish in each of the six stroke play events he has played this year, including a triumph at the Players Championship where he meditated for 20 minutes ahead of the final round.
Early indications, therefore, are that McIlroy may be on the right path with his meditation and juggling.
""They mightn't be the right things for other people, but I think I've found a formula that works for me, and I'm ‑‑ you know, I'm going to persist with it and I'm going to stick to it,"" said McIlroy.
""It's helped me play some of the best golf of my career so far this year, and you know, hopefully that will continue.""
When it comes to juggling, McIlroy described himself as a ""rookie"" who can only handle three balls at once.
""You know, maybe what resonates with me is isn't going to resonate with someone else, but I found what I feel is the best path forward for me and I've committed to it,"" McIlroy said.
McIlroy, who had another close call last year when he began the final round three shots behind eventual winner Patrick Reed, said the pressure he puts on himself at Augusta National compared to his previous appearances has changed.
""I would dearly love to win this tournament one day. If it doesn't happen this week, that's totally fine, I'll come back next year and have another crack at it,"" said McIlroy.
""But I'm happy with where everything is, body, mind, game.""

CAPE TOWN — South Africa's Super Rugby teams will be expected to pull their socks up after a dismal weekend where their commitment and character came in for harsh criticism.
Home defeats for the Bulls and Lions were unexpected and the nature of the Stormers' loss in Brisbane to the Queensland Reds brought stinging censure, not least from their within own camp.
The Lions, runners-up in the last two years in the southern hemisphere competition, were mauled 42-5 at home by the Sharks on Friday and this week departed for three matches in Australia and New Zealand hoping time on tour will forge new bonds.
“It’s a good thing we go on tour now to take the pressure off and get to know better some of the new guys,” said coach Swys de Bruin, who watched his charges capitulate against the Sharks just days after he had signed an extension to his contract with the Johannesburg-based franchise.
""I’m not here for the winning or losing,” he said after the Lions defeat at Ellis Park. ""I’m here for effort and guts and I didn’t see that.""
The Lions meet the Brumbies in Canberra on Saturday while the Bulls host the Reds in Pretoria later that day.
Last week at Loftus Versfeld, the Bulls lost again, a surprise 22-20 defeat by the Jaguares from Argentina.
“They had one opportunity in the first half and scored while we had so many, right through the match, that we didn’t use,” said coach Pote Human, who on Wednesday made six changes for Saturday’s clash against the Queenslanders.
“We will need to look at our discipline. The guys had white line fever – they’d be two metres from the line and drop the ball and there were funny kicks inside the 22.”
The Stormers are away at the Melbourne Rebels on Friday in the last of their four-match tour Down Under in which they have suffered three disappointing defeats.
The latest in Brisbane came after captain Siya Kolisi was needlessly yellow carded just before halftime, allowing the Reds to surge into a 14-point lead while he spent 10 minutes in the sin bin.
“Discipline let our team down, including the yellow card to myself, which was probably the turning point in the game,” said Kolisi, who has returned home as he is being rested this weekend.
All of which led former Springbok coach Andre Markgraaff to suggest South African rugby players did not have the requisite character at the highest level.
""It's been a problem in our rugby for years. Our teams will deliver a fantastic performance one Saturday but can't keep it up.
“After so many years of professional rugby we're still not over the mental barrier. I have no doubt that overall our players are mentally soft,"" Markgraaff told the Rapport newspaper.

OTTAWA, Ontario — Pierre-Luc Dubois scored two goals and the Columbus Blue Jackets beat the Ottawa Senators 6-2 in the regular-season finale for both teams Saturday.
The Blue Jackets, who clinched a playoff berth with a 3-2 shootout win over the New York Rangers on Friday, finished 47-31-4 and secured the second wild card in the Eastern Conference. They'll face the Tampa Bay Lightning in the first round of the playoffs.
Alexandre Texier, Riley Nash, Oliver Bjorkstrand and Markus Nutivaara also scored for the Blue Jackets. Joonas Korpisalo made 27 saves.
Thomas Chabot and Mikkel Boedker scored for the Senators (29-47-6). Anders Nilsson stopped 17 shots after replacing starter Craig Anderson, who was pulled midway through the first after giving up three goals on seven shots.
The Senators finished last in the NHL standings for the first time in 23 years.
Nilsson started the third period with a great save on Cam Atkinson, which seemed to fire up his teammates briefly.
The Senators cut the Blue Jackets' lead to 4-2 as Boedker, standing at the top of the crease, took a pass from Chris Tierney and sent a wrist shot past Korpisalo.
But a bad turnover by Boedker led to Bjorkstrand's second goal, and Nash scored into an empty net.
Trailing 3-0, the Senators finally got on the board midway through the second as Chabot beat Korpisalo with a backhand shot.
The Blue Jackets regained their three-goal lead when Texier scored his first career goal in just his second game.
Columbus opened the scoring three minutes into the game. Dubois took a pass from Artemi Panarin and beat Anderson with a high shot.
Midway through the first, Bjorkstrand slipped a puck through Mark Borowiecki's legs and dished it off to Nutivaara for his fifth of the season. Just over a minute later, some bad defensive coverage allowed Dubois to dig the puck out of the crease and beat Anderson for his second goal of the game.
NOTES: Ottawa's Ben Harpur missed his third straight game. ... The Blue Jackets opted to make goalie Sergei Bobrovsky a healthy scratch, giving him the night off.

CLEVELAND — Kemba Walker scored 23 points and the Charlotte Hornets pulled away in the fourth quarter to keep their late-season playoff push going with a 124-97 win Tuesday night over the Cleveland Cavaliers, whose painful first season rebuilding without LeBron James is finally over.
The Hornets (39-42) had to win to have any chance of beating out Detroit and Miami for the No. 8 spot in the Eastern Conference. Charlotte did its part and must now beat Orlando at home on Wednesday and hope the Pistons (39-42) lose in New York to clinch its first playoff berth in three years.
Detroit rallied to beat Memphis 100-93, setting up a dramatic final day of the season.
Jeremy Lamb added 23 points and Miles Bridges and Dwayne Bacon scored 18 apiece as the Hornets won their fourth straight.
The Cavs dropped their 10th in a row to finish 19-63, the fourth-worst record in franchise history and just the fifth time they've failed to win at least 20.
Cleveland again played without star forward Kevin Love, whose season was sabotaged early by a toe injury that required surgery and altered everything for the Cavs. Love's situation made things even tougher on the Cavs, who initially believed they could compete while recovering from the loss of James as a free agent for the second time.
Now the focus turns to coach Larry Drew's future and next month's NBA draft lottery.
Rookie Collin Sexton scored 18 points and had a season-high 10 assists for the Cavs. He also joined Larry Bird (1979-80) and Stephen Curry (2009-10) as the only rookies in league history to average at least 16 points while making over 40% of their 3-pointers and 80% of their free throws.
If the Hornets get back to the postseason for the first time in three years, Walker will be the reason.
The three-time All-Star, who is scheduled to become a free agent on July 1, is averaging 34.4 points in his last five games.
TIP-INS
Hornets: F Michael Kidd-Gilchrist was not with the team for the second straight game because of personal reasons. ... Walker enters Wednesday's game — perhaps the final one of his career with Charlotte — as the franchise leader in points and made 3-pointers, field goals and free throws. He's second in assists behind Muggsy Bogues and third in games played behind Dell Curry and Bogues.
Cavaliers: Love played 13 minutes on Sunday as a salute to close friend Channing Frye, who is retiring after 13 seasons. Love was limited to just 22 games this season because of the toe and other injuries. He'll consider playing this summer for Team USA. ... Frye was given a rousing ovation when he checked in and a video tribute from former teammates was shown. Dwyane Wade said, ""I thought you already retired."" Frye scored 10 in the fourth quarter. ... Sexton scored in double figures in his final 23 games. He's the first Cavs rookie to play all 82 games since Andre Miller in 1999-2000. ... G Matthew Dellavedova missed the final 17 games with a concussion sustained on March 6 at Brooklyn.
UP NEXT
Hornets: Lost to the Magic, Wednesday's opponent, by 38 on Feb. 14.
Cavaliers: Eagerly await the NBA draft lottery on May 12.

(Reuters) - Chilean Christian Garin saved five match points to upset second seed Jeremy Chardy of France 3-6 7-6(4) 7-6(7) and advance to the quarter-finals of the U.S. Men's Clay Court Championship in Houston on Wednesday.
The 22-year-old benefited from a fortunate bounce on match point in the third set tiebreaker when Chardy's forehand caught the net cord and was redirected out of bounds, ending the three hour affair.
While Garin was rewarded for his never-say-die attitude, Chardy was his own worst enemy, issuing 13 double faults including two in the decisive third set tiebreaker.
Next up for Garin is a quarter-final meeting with Swiss Henri Laaksonen, whose stout defense made the difference in his 6-4 7-5 win over American Ryan Harrison earlier in the day on the red clay courts.
Upsets were in the humid Texas air as Norway's Casper Ruud overcame 16 aces from fourth-seeded Reilly Opelka to claw back to a 4-6 6-4 6-4 win to end the day's action.
Ruud converted his lone break point opportunity in the second set and took advantage of a mistake-prone Opelka in the third set to advance over the big-serving American.
Ruud will face Marcel Granollers in the quarters after the Spaniard upset fifth-seeded American Taylor Fritz in the opening round and crushed Australian Bernard Tomic 6-1 6-2 on Monday to advance.
With Opelka eliminated only two of the 11 American who entered the tournament are left -- top-seeded Steve Johnson and Sam Querrey.

TORREON, Mexico — Tigres reached the final of the CONCACAF Champions League for the third time in four years on Wednesday with a 5-3 aggregate win over Santos Laguna despite giving up a 2-0 lead to lose the away leg of the semi-final 3-2.
The Monterrey side have never won the region's premier club competition but, 3-0 up from the first leg, wasted no time in silencing the home crowd with goals from Enner Valencia and Julian Quinones in the first 34 minutes.
Julio Furch got goals back for the home side four minutes before half time and on the hour before Diego Valdes put them 3-2 ahead on the night when he stabbed home a spilled cross with a quarter of an hour remaining.
Man of the Match Quinones hit the post twice for the visitors and Javier Correa missed a penalty for Santos with almost the last kick of the game.
Tigres, runners up to America in 2016 and another Mexican side Pachuca in 2017, will play either city rivals Monterrey or Sporting Kansas City for the title later this month.
Monterrey lead 5-0 after the first leg, making them odds-on favourites to progress after Thursday night's second leg in Kansas.

LONDON — Liverpool fans could be excused if they break out into cold sweats in the build-up to this weekend's crunch Premier League clash with bogey side Chelsea at Anfield.
Rewind five years and Liverpool hosted Chelsea with three games remaining, knowing victory would have left them six points clear and a first league title since 1990 almost secure.
The rest, as they say, is history.
In first-half-stoppage time talisman Steven Gerrard, of all people, miscontrolled Mamadou Sakho's pass in his own half; he stumbled, allowing Demba Ba to race through alone and score.
Liverpool eventually lost 2-0, threw away a 3-0 lead against Crystal Palace to draw 3-3 a week later, and ended up losing the title race to Manchester City by two points.
Chelsea fans will delight in their own version of the ""Steven Gerrard song"" this Sunday when their side again have the chance to sabotage Liverpool's title ambitions.
With Manchester City able to go a point clear if they beat Crystal Palace 24 hours earlier in London, Liverpool know a only a first home win over Chelsea for seven years will take them back to the top of the table.
Should Juergen Klopp's side take the three points in what is the toughest of their remaining five fixtures, their fans will start to truly believe their long wait for the title is coming to an end.
Champions City, who have a game in hand over their title rivals, are still to play Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur in their run-in.
Maurizio Sarri's Chelsea have been unpredictable this season, but after Eden Hazard's superb performance in a 2-0 defeat of West Ham United on Monday, they will go to Anfield in the top four and eyeing Champions League qualification.
Such has been the rivalry between the clubs since Liverpool's Luis Garcia scored what former Blues boss Jose Mourinho described as the ""ghost goal"" in the 2005 Champions League semi-final, there is nothing Chelsea's fans would enjoy more than stalling the Anfield club's title bid again.
Liverpool's recent home record against Chelsea is lamentable, losing three and drawing five of the last eight at Anfield, with the 2014 defeat the most painful.
City suffered only their second loss in their last 24 games in all competitions when they went down 1-0 to Tottenham in the Champions League quarter-final, first leg on Tuesday -- the same night Liverpool beat Porto 2-0 to move towards the semi-finals.
CITY FATIGUE
Pep Guardiola's side have begun to show a few signs of fatigue as their pursuit of an unprecedented quadruple reaches its climax.
They will need no reminding that Palace produced one of the most stunning results of the season at the Etihad Stadium in December when they won 3-2 thanks in no small part to a wonder strike by Andros Townsend.
City will hope to have Bernardo Silva fit after he was ruled out against Tottenham through injury.
The fierce battle for third and fourth spots also continues this weekend with fourth-placed Tottenham hosting relegated Huddersfield at their new stadium -- having won their first two matches there without conceding.
Tottenham, who look certain to be without injured striker Harry Kane, possibly for the rest of the campaign, have 64 points from 32 games, two behind Chelsea having played one game less.
Arsenal, who visit FA Cup finalists Watford on Monday, have 63 points, while Manchester United (61) take on West Ham at Old Trafford on Saturday.
In the battle to escape relegation, third-from-bottom Cardiff City travel to Burnley, while Southampton, five points above them, host Wolverhampton Wanderers.

AUGUSTA, Ga. — It was a clash of the ages at the Masters Par-3 contest on Wednesday as 28-year-old Matt Wallace triumphed over 61-year-old Sandy Lyle during an afternoon of thrilling play that included four holes-in-one.
A time-honored tradition at Augusta National, the Par-3 contest sees Masters competitors and the old guard play on a truncated course with shorter holes, with their children and spouses often serving as caddies.
Along with collecting the trophy, however, comes a famous curse as no winner has gone on to win the Masters in the same year.
Wallace, who kicks off his Masters bid on Thursday, shrugged off the so-called jinx, after a playoff win against two-times major winner Lyle.
""It got a little bit more serious than how the nine holes went and I guess I just I wanted to win this,"" Wallace said. ""I want to break history somewhat.""
Some of the game's greats, such as Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus were involved alongside current players such as Bubba Watson and Dustin Johnson, and for a crowd hungry to see a hole-in-one, the day did not disappoint.
Wallace landed an ace at the eighth hole, while Mark O'Meara, the 1998 Masters and British Open champion, snagged the day's first hole-in-one to wild applause, followed by 32-year-old Shane Lowry, who sunk one on the first hole.
Nineteen-year-old Devon Bling equaled the record for the youngest registered player ever to make a hole-in-one on the course.
Last year, Nicklaus' 15-year-old grandson, who was caddying for him, sunk a hole-in-one on the ninth hole, marking a memorable family moment in an event where one is as likely to see a toddler on the course as a major winner.
One-year-old Azalea, named after Augusta's 13th hole, caddied for her father, 2017 Masters champion Sergio Garcia, and was an early crowd favorite as she toddled onto the green appearing completely at home on the course.
""The golfers are in their element but they're having fun,"" said Sean Neely, an Atlanta resident who has attended the Masters for 47 years.
Seeing players on TV ""it's like seeing a movie star,"" said Pam Herzwuran, who has visited the Masters for seven years. Seeing them with their families makes them feel more accessible, she said.
""It makes it so normal.""

MINNEAPOLIS — Virginia looked headed for a second crushing end to its NCAA Tournament.
One whistle, one slight bump and three clutch free throws changed everything.
Kyle Guy hit three free throws with 0.6 seconds left to help the Cavaliers beat Auburn 63-62 in a wild and controversial finish Saturday night in the national semifinals of the NCAA Tournament.
It's the result of a play that will be long discussed, with official James Breeding whistling Samir Doughty for a bump on Guy's desperation 3-point shot with the No. 1 seed Virginia facing elimination before the final.
Doughty's torso made contact with Guy's right thigh as he elevated for the twisting shot. Guy's shot bounced off the rim as the horn sounded in what appeared to be an Auburn win. Guy even began to cover his face with his jersey as the shot missed, thinking his season was over.
It took a few seconds before it was clear there had been a foul called,
It took a few seconds before it was clear that there had been a foul call, prompting a wave of stunned cheers from Virginia fans and downright furious boos from Auburn fans.
Guy made the first two free throws to tie the game, then came out of an Auburn timeout to hit the third that put Virginia ahead.
The Tigers' final heave downcourt for a desperation catch-and-shoot 3 from Brown wasn't close.
This time, however, it was the end.
Virginia players mobbed Guy on the court and Cavaliers fans celebrated wildly, continuing the yearlong story of their rise from the rubble following their unprecedented 16-vs-1 upset loss to Auburn last season.
Auburn fans, however, were irate.
Auburn assistant coach Steven Pearl ran part of the way across the court after the buzzer, shouting at the officials before departing. The officials soon sprinted off to the tunnel for their exit amid a few obscene gestures and insults hurled their way from the nearby Auburn student section, where shock had given way to fury.
Security staffers even had to eject a few of the most unruly fans.
Others walked away from floor seats with tears at the end of a wild tournament run that had seen the fifth-seeded Tigers take down bluebloods Kansas, North Carolina and Kentucky in succession to reach their first Final Four.
Yet that tournament run very nearly ended in the first round with a play that proved eerily familiar by Saturday night in Minneapolis.
It was in Salt Lake City where Auburn fouled a 3-point shooter for New Mexico State while protecting a slim lead with 1.1 seconds left. This time, though, Terrell Brown missed two of the three free throws to help Auburn survive 78-77.
The foul happened again. This time, the free throws fell through to end the Tigers' romping ride.

LUBBOCK, Tex. — Although Texas Tech’s dazzling quest for a national championship in men’s basketball came to an end in Minneapolis on Monday night, fans who had shared the unlikely ride were already looking to the future.
“We’re going to get it done by the time I graduate,” said Christopher Rodriguez, an 18-year-old freshman from Houston, as he and more than 5,500 other fans spilled out of United Supermarkets Arena in Lubbock, Tex., where they had gathered to watch the game.
They endured an emotional roller coaster, as the Red Raiders repeatedly seemed within reach of their first N.C.A.A. title before eventually
falling to the Virginia Cavaliers, 85-77, in overtime
.
The Lubbock police had beefed up their presence around campus and closed off major streets, fearing a repeat of the rowdy behavior that followed Texas Tech’s
semifinal victory over Michigan State
on Saturday. That night, people tipped over cars, set fire to a couch and committed other acts that Police Chief Gregory Stevens has said will result in charges of arson, criminal mischief and rioting.
But the streets were quieter on Monday, whether because of the expanded police presence or simply because defeat had left Raider Nation subdued.
Despite the loss, fans took pride in a season that had taken their team to the pinnacle of college basketball. More people made the trip to Minneapolis for the final than watched the game from the arena in Lubbock.
“I’ve been waiting since 1961, and I would have hitchhiked if I had to,” Kent Hance, a Texas Tech graduate and former chancellor, said by telephone from Minneapolis a few hours before the game.
Officials in Lubbock, the metropolitan center of an agrarian region in northwestern Texas, were happy about the national exposure.
“If you mention Lubbock, there’s a better chance of them recognizing where Lubbock is and what we stand for as a result of the success of the team,” said John Osborne, president and chief executive of the city’s Economic Development Alliance.
Mayor Dan Pope, a Texas Tech alumnus (like his parents), said the city’s economic team had determined that 5,540 articles were published about Lubbock and the university around the tournament, which they said was worth $44 million in advertising. “It’s had a huge impact,” he said.
Fans’ devotion soared to fever pitch as the final game approached. Long lines snaked outside Red Raider Outfitter in southeastern Lubbock. Katie Hartman, the store’s lead buyer, said people had started arriving at 7 a.m. hoping to get special championship game T-shirts. Sales volume was “the largest we’ve ever seen,” she said.
After the game, Chris Cook, the university’s communications director, tried to put the loss in perspective, noting that of 68 teams in the tournament, Texas Tech was one of the last two standing.
“A lot of people would have liked to be in our shoes,” he said.

ANAHEIM, Calif. — Mike Trout hit a grand slam for his fourth homer in three days, and the Los Angeles Angels beat the Texas Rangers 5-1 on Saturday for their first back-to-back victories of the season.
Trout's 458-foot blast in the fourth inning off Drew Smyly (0-1) cleared the bullpens beyond the left field fence at Angel Stadium. After homering in the Halos' home opener Thursday and adding two more Friday, Trout delivered the biggest blow yet with his fifth career grand slam, his first since 2015.
Albert Pujols added his 634th career homer in the seventh for Los Angeles. Pujols' first homer of his 19th big league season was his 3,089th career hit, tying Ichiro Suzuki for 22nd place in major league history.
Isiah Kiner-Falefa had an RBI single in the fifth for the Rangers, who couldn't match the Angels' big hits.
Trout is off to a dynamite start after cementing his future in Anaheim with a 12-year, $426.5 million contract before the season. He has reached base in all nine games this season, including four times Saturday while boosting his average to .385.
Tyler Skaggs (1-1) pitched 6 1/3 innings of five-hit ball in a strong outing for the Angels. The left-hander won his third consecutive start against Texas, giving up just two earned runs in 17 1/3 innings.
Smyly stranded six Angels runners in the first three innings, but Trout cleared the bases in the fourth on a high fastball after Peter Bourjos beat out an infield single to start the rally.
Trout has homered in three straight games for the seventh consecutive time in his career. He homered in four straight during May 2017.
Trout's slam chased Smyly, who gave up six hits and three walks in his second start for his new team after two years of recovery following Tommy John surgery.
Pujols connected on the first pitch of the seventh inning by Adrian Sampson. He got his 1,984th career RBI, eight behind Babe Ruth for fifth place in baseball history.
David Fletcher had three hits, reached base four times and stole a base in his first game of the season as the Angels' leadoff hitter.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Rangers: 1B Ronald Guzman left with tightness in his right hamstring in the third inning after running out his double to the right field wall.
Angels: Kole Calhoun ran into the right field wall while attempting to catch Guzman's double in the third, but he stayed in the game after a long consultation with LA's training staff. Calhoun left the game in the seventh inning after striking out three times.
UP NEXT
Late-spring acquisition Chris Stratton (0-1, 8.31 ERA) makes his Angel Stadium debut after getting raked by Seattle in his first appearance for the Halos. Shelby Miller (0-0, 4.91) will make his second start for the Rangers in the finale of the four-game series.

Chris Mullin stepped down as the men’s basketball coach at St. John’s on Tuesday after four years on the job, citing a personal loss.
Mike Cragg, the St. John’s athletic director, announced the decision, saying the team had “progressed well” and noting Mullin’s “deep passion for this program.” Cragg did not give an explanation for the move.
Without elaborating, Mullin said in a separate statement that he had suffered a “recent personal loss.” His older brother, Roddy, a former Siena basketball player, died last month at 58 after battling cancer for years.
Mullin, 55, had two years remaining on his contract, and he had just completed his only winning season and only trip to the N.C.A.A. tournament as the St. John’s coach, losing to Arizona State in the First Four.
Mullin, the greatest player in St. John’s history, said his decision had been extremely emotional.
“I took time to reflect upon my true values and believe this is the right time to make a change,” Mullin said in the statement. “I am extremely grateful to the administration, which has supported me and our basketball program on every level.”
Cragg said St. John’s would pursue an experienced coach “committed to building a championship-level program” and “ready to build upon the recent successes of our program with integrity by recruiting young men of high character.”
Bobby Hurley, a New Jersey native who is Arizona State’s coach, is reportedly considered a top candidate to replace Mullin. Hurley was a star point guard at Duke, where Cragg spent more than three decades as an administrator before being hired by St. John’s in September.
The Red Storm went 59-73 under Mullin, including 20-52 in the Big East Conference, after he replaced Steve Lavin in March 2015 and embarked on a substantial rebuild.
Bobby Gempesaw, the president of St. John’s, said that because of Mullin the “university community has grown closer, there has been excitement throughout campus.”
Led by guard Shamorie Ponds and several talented transfers, the Red Storm won their first 12 games this past season for their best start since 1982-83, when Mullin was a sophomore. They cracked The Associated Press Top 25 poll for the first time in four years but faded down the stretch, losing five of their final six games and six of the last eight to finish at 21-13.
Once a national power, the St. John’s program has not won an N.C.A.A. tournament game since 2000.
After the season-ending loss to Arizona State, Ponds announced that he would pass up his senior season to enter the N.B.A. draft. Also the team’s top recruiter, Matt Abdelmassih, left for a job at Nebraska, and Cam Mack, a junior college point guard, asked to be released from the national letter of intent he had signed with St. John’s.
Mullin, a two-time Olympic gold medalist and a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame, led St. John’s to the 1985 Final Four and remains the school’s career scoring leader. Born in Brooklyn, he was a five-time All-Star during his 16 seasons in the N.B.A., with the Golden State Warriors and the Indiana Pacers.
Before taking the job at his alma mater to much fanfare, Mullin had no head coaching experience. He had been an N.B.A. executive, serving as general manager of the Warriors and a special adviser with the Sacramento Kings. His coaching tenure was highlighted by consecutive victories over top-five teams in February 2018: Duke and No. 1 Villanova, the eventual national champion.
St. John’s still ranks among the top 10 N.C.A.A. Division I men’s teams in wins, though the school has not advanced beyond the quarterfinals of the Big East tournament since 2000.

AUGUSTA, Ga. — Augusta National opens its hallowed grounds to the public for the Masters each year but anyone trying to learn about the finer details of the exclusive club can expect to be met with a CIA-level of secrecy.
Everything from revenue at the club's massive merchandise store, where a seemingly never-ending line snakes through the doors all week, to the attendance figures at the year's first major are considered classified information at Augusta National.
Even seemingly unobtrusive requests to interview the head groundskeeper of the immaculate course or the person who dry cleans the coveted Green Jackets worn by all Masters champions and club members are all politely declined.
""It's Augusta, you just don't ask too many questions,"" former world number one Dustin Johnson, who is a favorite to win a maiden Green Jacket this week, told Reuters when asked about the club's impenetrable cloak of secrecy.
Affectionately regarded as the 'Cathedral of Pines', the 7,475-yard Augusta National layout is one of the most famous golf courses in the world and the only permanent venue for any of the sport's four majors.
From Magnolia Lane, a tree-lined drive that members use to enter the grounds, to Amen Corner, which may just be golf's most famous stretch of holes, Augusta National has become a place all golfers dream of seeing once before they die.
Patrons at the Masters can easily find themselves walking the course alongside a member but they will be hard-pressed to get any of those wearing Green Jackets to open up about one of the more exclusive clubs on the planet.
""It's just the way it's always been,"" said South Africa's 2008 Masters champion Trevor Immelman.
""I think it's the way (club founders) Bobby Jones and Clifford Roberts wanted it and they had an idea in mind and they created it and they were very proud of it and that's the way it stayed.
""That adds to the mystique of it and the fact that also the world's best players throughout history absolutely love coming back here and with this event and this week in particular that's what makes it a lot of fun.""
'IT'S PRIVATE'
The club's level of secrecy also extends to any plans it may or may not have to amend its grounds or the surrounding areas.
One local news station, which cited plans filed with the city, reported in February that Augusta National has begun a project to tunnel under a road that runs alongside the course, but for what purpose is anyone's guess.
""This is Augusta National, the Masters is a tournament they host and give us the privilege to play,"" said 2007 Masters champion Zach Johnson. ""This is a private institution. It's private and they can do whatever the heck they want.""
When it comes to the Masters tradition is everything, and with that comes a strict list of rules that, if violated, could result in the offender being escorted from the course.
As much as Augusta National is renowned for its beauty, it is also known as a place where patrons are not allowed to run or take photos during the tournament. Perhaps the biggest no-no, one that is strictly enforced, is the use of mobile phones.
Spain's twice Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal was very clear when asked about the club's strict policies and desire to keep its dealings private from outsiders.
""I can say I feel comfortable with that. Period.""
Like all Masters champions, fellow Spaniard Sergio Garcia became an honorary member with his triumph in 2017, a win that perhaps afforded him a sneak peak behind the mystique spawned by the secrecy that surrounds the club.
For Garcia, Augusta National's combination of exclusivity and secrecy are easily part of what makes it so special.
""If you say or you show everything that you have obviously it's not quite the same,"" said Garcia. ""But it's amazing to be a part of this amazing family and this iconic club and I'm very thankful for it.""

TOKYO — Japan's Olympic Minister, Yoshitaka Sakurada, has resigned a year before the Tokyo Games for remarks that offended people affected by the massive earthquake and tsunami that triggered nuclear meltdowns in 2011.
""Minister Sakurada offered to resign as he made comments that hurt the feelings of those in the disaster affected areas,"" Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters on Wednesday after he accepted Sakurada's resignation.
""It is the Abe government's unwavering policy to do everything we can for recovery while keeping in touch with the feelings of people in disaster-hit areas ... As prime minister, I would like to offer my deep apology for the comment.""
Abe has decided to ask lower house lawmaker Shunichi Suzuki, who was Olympic minister before Sakurada took the post last October, to fill the vacancy, public broadcaster NHK said.
Seeking to compliment fellow lawmaker Hinako Takahashi, who was hosting a party, Sakurada had told her that she was more important than disaster recovery, according to NHK.
The 2011 quake and tsunami, which engulfed large swathes of eastern Japan's Pacific coast, left more than 20,000 people dead or missing.
Gaffe-prone Sakurada said last month that it was fortunate that arterial roads in northern Japan remained operational following the disaster.
In fact, many of main roads in the tsunami- and quake-hit areas, in fact, were not passable and highways were closed for non-emergency vehicles. Sakurada later took back his comment.

OAKLAND, Calif. — Soaking in the franchise's nostalgia of yesteryear, Stephen Curry scored 27 points and helped the Golden State Warriors clinch the Western Conference's top seed with a win in their final regular-season game at Oracle Arena, beating the Los Angeles Clippers 131-104 on Sunday night for a fifth straight victory.
Kevin Durant added 16 points and seven assists, making six of seven field goals, as the Warriors players opted to honor the past by sporting throwback white ""We Believe"" jerseys worn during the 2007 playoff run that snapped a 12-year postseason drought.
A banner commemorating 47 years at Oracle was unveiled afterward and it will move across the bay to hang inside new Chase Center in San Francisco where the Warriors will play next season.
""Let me just say that for 47 years, Warriors fans have stuck with us through thick and thin,"" coach Steve Kerr told fans moments after the final buzzer, also thanking the arena staff. ""Let's be honest, most of those years have been a little thin.""
Landry Shamet scored 17 points with five 3-pointers for a Clippers team still missing Patrick Beverley because of a right hip pointer. Los Angeles dropped into a seventh-place tie with San Antonio in the Western Conference by losing its third straight. Now, the Clippers play the Jazz in the regular-season finale Wednesday and with various scenarios very well could be returning to Oracle next weekend for Game 1 in the first round of the playoffs.
Draymond Green just missed a triple-double with 10 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists in Golden State's seventh win over the last eight games and fifth in a row at home. DeMarcus Cousins contributed 12 points, nine boards and four assists playing with foul trouble.
Even with the playoffs around the corner, this was a night of celebrating the end of a nearly five-decade run in the arena.
""Are they not going to make the playoffs?"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers quipped. ""I hope they don't make it. That would be phenomenal. I'm just saying, it would be.""
The Warriors beat the Clippers for the 16th time in the last 18 matchups and 15th in 17 at home.
Golden State made 10 of its first 13 shots — Durant hitting his initial four and Curry starting 3 for 3. Curry wound up just 3 for 10 from deep.
HONORING ORACLE
The Warriors played their 1,936th regular-season game at Oracle, where the first game was held on Oct. 24, 1967, against Cincinnati. Golden State's overall record in the venue: 1,166-770.
""Since it's not really the last game here, I know it's a ceremonial final game, I didn't get too sentimental or emotional or anything because hopefully we will be coming back here and playing a lot more games in the next couple months,"" Kerr said. ""I'll probably hold off onto the emotion until it actually happens.""
Kerr narrated an appreciation video to fans and the arena on a night old favorites such as Sleepy Floyd, Rick Barry, Adonal Foyle and Marreese Speights were on hand for the festivities.
The Oakland Symphony performed at halftime as more highlights played.
TIP-INS
Clippers: Rivers would like to play the Warriors in the playoffs, just not in the first round. ""If you want to win, you've got to play somebody at some point. We're not dodging,"" Rivers said. ""I just want to be healthy and playing great in the playoffs. Do we want to play the Warriors in the playoffs? Yes. Do we want to do it in the first round? Probably not, but you've got to take it when you get it."" ... Los Angeles is 0-4 without Beverley, who missed his third straight game. ... All five starters reached double figures.
Warriors: A tribute to Al Attles was shown on the big screen during a first-quarter timeout for his selection into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame. Attles, a former player, coach, general manager with the Warriors and current ambassador, hasn't been well enough to attend games this season but received an ovation. ... Cousins received his third foul 6:49 before halftime on a debatable charge. ... Shaun Livingston, who had been questionable with a bruised left knee, made all four of his shots in 13 minutes. ... Every Warriors player scored. ... Andre Iguodala sat out with a sore left toe. ... Golden State finished 30-11 at home and 19-7 against the Western Conference.

AUGUSTA, Ga. — Like many golf fans, one of Brooks Koepka's most vivid Masters moments involves three-times champion Phil Mickelson.
Pulling it up from deep inside his childhood memory banks, Koepka recalled in detail on Tuesday his meeting with Mickelson near the Augusta National parking lot two decades ago when a starry eyed kid with dreams of being a Masters winner one day cornered 'Lefty' for an autograph.
""He turned me down, (I am) probably about the only kid Phil's ever turned down,"" recalled Koepka with a chuckle. ""He told me years later, I shouldn't have been in the parking lot so fair enough.
""He doesn't remember. I mean, I can't believe he doesn't remember the first time he ever said no to a kid, signing an autograph.
""I told him, I think in 2014, I think we were playing a practice round at the British Open. I had to tell him. I was like, 'Listen, man, you stiffed me and I really didn't like you for a long time'.
""We can laugh about it now.""
Fast forward 20 years and Koepka is a three-times major winner signing autographs at Augusta National -- the only hint of a scar left from the Mickelson brush-off is his difficulty in saying 'no' to a little kid.
Koepka said he has since got Mickelson's autograph and this week will be focused on getting his own name on the Masters trophy and slipping into a Green Jacket.
In each of his three previous Masters, the 28-year-old American has made progress but is still without a top-10, with his best finish a tie for 11th in 2017.
He watched last year's tournament from his couch recovering from a wrist injury.
He returns to Augusta National as a far different player, having since won three majors, back-to-back U.S. Opens in 2017 and 2018 along with the 2018 PGA Championship.
""I've got three trophies that I haven't had any time I've teed it up (here),"" said Koepka. ""I've never been a major champion when I played here.
""Completely different player probably. (I) Understand how to handle pressure a lot better, understand this golf course a lot better. Even sitting out a year, there are certain things you can pick up on when you're watching.
""And (I have) really kind of matured on and off the golf course. I think it is a big deal.""
""It's nice to be back here. It's always a special place to be playing.""

AUGUSTA, Ga. — After 26 Masters appearances, it is hard to catch three-time champion Phil Mickelson off guard even with a revamped fifth hole that has been the talk of Augusta National this week.
Steely play may be in order at the redesigned Magnolia, where the tee has been moved back 40 yards, but Mickelson told reporters on Tuesday that he was taking it in his stride.
""I think 4, 5, 6, 7 is a very difficult four-hole stretch and making it a little bit harder I think is a good thing,"" Mickelson said. ""I always like making hard holes harder.""
Experience on the difficult greens is something Mickelson can rely on to help snag a Green Jacket for the fourth time, with his 100th career round at the Masters slated for Friday.
""There are always little subtleties and nuances that you have to relearn,"" he said.
""Every time I come out here and practise, I pick up a little something here or there that I did not know on how to play a certain shot from a certain position to a certain pin.""
If he can secure victory, it will be by defying the odds. Mickelson, who will turn 49 in June, is roughly two and a half years older than the oldest Masters champion Jack Nicklaus, who claimed his sixth victory in 1986 at the age of 46.
Mickelson already has a career befitting one of the game's greats, having spent over 25 years on the PGA tour, with 195 top-10 finishes, 44 PGA championships and five major wins.
That does not mean he is looking to slow down anytime soon.
""There's no reason now with the knowledge we have in fitness, the knowledge we have in biomechanics, and the knowledge we have with nutrition and so forth, that we, at a much older age than in the past, should not be able to perform at a very high level,"" Mickelson said.
The only major to elude him has been the U.S. Open, in which he has either tied for or placed second on six times.
But after winning the Pebble Beach Pro-Am in February, it seems a career grand slam may still be in reach since this year's U.S. Open will be played on the same course.

AMSTERDAM — Ajax Amsterdam will have midfielder Frenkie de Jong available for Wednesday's Champions League tie against Juventus, and coach Erik ten Hag is hoping Cristiano Ronaldo is passed fit to play too.
""Of course it's going to be nice to be able to play against Ronaldo. We want to measure ourselves up against the best,"" said Ten Hag at the pre-match media conference on Tuesday.
Ronaldo is a doubt for the game because of a thigh injury sustained a fortnight ago while playing for Portugal in the Euro 2020 qualifiers.
He last played for the Italian champions in the previous round against Atletico Madrid, scoring a hat trick to lead Juventus to a thrilling comeback victory.
Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri at the weekend said he was confident the 34-year-old would be ready for Wednesday's game in Amsterdam, although he would still need to pass a late fitness test.
The Italians are already without midfielder Emre Can and central defender Giorgio Chiellini, neither of whom travelled for the quarter-final first leg tie at the Amsterdam Arena.
""Juventus will miss his experience. But just like all the other top teams in Europe, they have enough good players to replace him,"" said Ten Hag.
De Jong, who is moving to Barcelona at the end of the season, suffered an ankle injury in last Saturday's 4-1 league win over Willem II Tilburg but his availability is a boost for Ajax, who knocked out holders Real Madrid in the last 16.
""The bar is now raised again, but it is challenge we are looking forward to.
""The challenges are getting more difficult. We've already on a few occasions this season surpassed expectation, and we want to do that again tomorrow night,"" the Ajax coach added.

CHICAGO — Kyle Schwarber hit a two-run homer and Chicago's beleaguered bullpen stepped up after Jon Lester departed with left hamstring tightness, leading the Cubs over the Pittsburgh Pirates 10-0 in their home opener on Monday.
Brad Brach, Brandon Kintzler, Randy Rosario and Pedro Strop combined for seven innings of four-hit ball after Lester was removed with two on and no outs in the third. Brach (1-0) pitched two innings for his first win with the Cubs.
Chicago had an 8.37 bullpen ERA on its opening 2-7 trip, amplifying concerns about pitching depth with relievers Brandon Morrow, Xavier Cedeno and Tony Barnette sidelined by injuries. Manager Joe Maddon said he was confident the bullpen will settle eventually, and it delivered on a picturesque day at Wrigley Field.
Pittsburgh had won four in a row, but it hurt itself with four errors, including three by shortstop Kevin Newman. Melky Cabrera had two of the Pirates' seven hits.
The game began to get away from Pittsburgh after Jameson Taillon (0-2) retired the first two batters in the second. Daniel Descalso reached on a throwing error by Newman, and Chicago was off and running.
After Jason Heyward was walked intentionally, Lester drove a 0-2 pitch into the gap in left-center for an RBI double. Lester scored from second on Ben Zobrist's two-run single, sliding home safely for a 3-0 lead.
Anthony Rizzo and Javier Baez tacked on RBI singles, and Newman committed two more errors on a Schwarber grounder, allowing another run to come home. Baez shrugged as he stood on first base after throwing his bat at a ball in the dirt, leading to a liner that just got over Newman's head.
Taillon was charged with six unearned runs and four hits in two innings. Rizzo's run-scoring single appeared to go off his head, but he stayed in the game.
Schwarber capped the scoring when he drove a 1-0 pitch from Steven Brault over the wall in left-center for his third homer in the fourth, delighting the crowd of 40,692. He went deep 26 times last season.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Pirates: OF Gregory Polanco (left shoulder surgery) and RHP Dovydas Neverauskas (left oblique strain) began rehab assignments with Class A Bradenton on Sunday.
Cubs: Morrow (elbow surgery) has completed each of his bullpen sessions so far ""without incident,"" according to president of baseball operations Theo Epstein. The next step for Morrow is expected to be finalized this week. ... Barnette (right shoulder inflammation) and Cedeno (left wrist inflammation) are ""moving along and getting closer to the possibility of rehab assignments,"" Epstein said. ""No setbacks with either guy.""

Following an off day, right-handers Jordan Lyles and Yu Darvish get the ball when the series resumes Wednesday night. Lyles (0-0, 0.00 ERA) made his Pittsburgh debut Thursday against Cincinnati and pitched five innings in the Pirates' 2-0 victory. Darvish (0-1, 8.10 ERA) struggled in his first two starts of the year, issuing 11 walks in just 6 2/3 innings.

PITTSBURGH — Casey DeSmith has seen it at every stop of his hockey career. Practice comes, the focus shifts to defending and the guys paid lavishly to score goals take their foot off the gas.
""I've had people on every single team I've ever played on like that, obviously,"" the Pittsburgh Penguins goaltender said. ""It just comes with the territory of being a gifted offensive player.""
There is an exception. Then again, there almost always is when it comes to Sidney Crosby.
The Penguins captain — whose resume is stuffed with six 100-point seasons, a pair of scoring titles and two Hart Trophies as the NHL's Most Valuable Player — has long been respected and feared for his creative playmaking.
It's his leadership and conscientious approach to every aspect of the game while stewarding the Penguins through a rocky season to a 13th straight playoff berth that has put the 31-year-old into the conversation for the Selke Trophy, given annually to the NHL's top defensive forward.
Both the metrics and the eye test heading into Pittsburgh's first-round matchup with the New York Islanders provide a compelling case.
Crosby won more than 55% of his faceoffs this season, his best mark since 2009-10. He blocked 43 shots and took away the puck from an opponent 54 times, the second-highest total of his career. After a talk with coach Mike Sullivan last fall, Crosby occasionally found himself killing penalties, a role he embraced and would have happily kept doing if not for concerns over his workload.
Still, there are situations when Sullivan knows he needs the star he calls ""the best 200-foot player in the game"" to go do his thing. Nursing a one-goal lead late against Carolina on March 31, Sullivan sent Crosby over the boards over and over and over as the clock dwindled. Pittsburgh held the Hurricanes at bay and emerged with a crucial 3-1 win.
""He was out there three of the last five minutes, defending the six-on-five, defending the five-on-four,"" Sullivan said. ""He was the one guy that was dominant in the faceoff circle. I thought his defensive effort was on display.""
Hall of Famer Sergei Fedorov was the last player to capture the Selke while scoring 100 points, doing it for Detroit in 1996. Crosby has an outside shot at joining that exclusive company when the league awards are announced in June. Not that Crosby, who has never finished higher than seventh in Selke voting, seems to care.
""I'm still trying to figure it out, to be honest with you,"" Crosby said. ""I think it's still something, you're trying to ingrain those habits and be in the right positions. I think experience helps that. You realize that it can help you offensively to be good defensively too. It's not as bad as sometimes you think it needs to be. I think that's part of it.""
Or maybe more than a part of it.
Pittsburgh center Matt Cullen, at 42 the league's oldest player, has carved out a 21-year career due in large part to his defensive expertise. Around the time he hit 30, Cullen knew he needed to find different ways to contribute beyond trying to put the puck in the net if he wanted to stick around. He sees Crosby taking some of the same steps not out of necessity but by choice, which makes it all the more impressive.
""I think Sid's the best example of a guy that has that growth mindset as far as he's never completely satisfied with where he's at,"" Cullen said. ""He's always evolving and learning and adapting to different situations.""
Cullen likened Crosby to Michael Jordan, who was named to the NBA's All-Defensive team nine times in addition to winning 10 scoring titles and leading the Chicago Bulls to six championships.
""Sid's accepted all the challenges of playing against the top lines and then going out and scoring, too,"" Cullen said.
Forward Jared McCann arrived in a trade with Florida on Feb. 1. The 22-year-old grew up admiring Crosby from afar. The up-close look has been even more revealing. McCann will find himself transfixed on Crosby's No. 87 during film sessions, studying the subtle aspects of Crosby's play in Pittsburgh's end looking for tips that might translate to his own game, be it positioning, physicality or a sense on knowing where the puck is headed before it gets there.
""I kind of catch myself moving a little bit too much, kind of circling too much,"" McCann said. ""I see him stop his feet and then read the play, see where it's going to go and then go. I feel like as a young player, as much as you can watch him in the defensive zone, you should learn from him.""
Coach Peter Laviolette has spent more than a decade trying to find ways to deal with Crosby during stops in Carolina, Philadelphia and now Nashville, with only occasional success.
""Never once did it cross my mind to think maybe we could put somebody on the ice and take advantage of him,"" Laviolette said. ""It's just that I think his offense overshadows (his defense) sometimes because he's an elite offensive player.""
Which Sullivan believes separates Crosby from annual Selke contenders like Boston's Patrice Bergeron and Los Angeles' Anze Kopitar.
""He's the most dangerous guy with the puck,"" Sullivan said. ""He also has the ability to score goals at the other end of the rink in quick strike better than any of the other players in conversation.""
Opportunities that typically begin with Crosby in the defensive zone, doing the dirty work others won't in an effort to produce the highlights few can.
""His ability to win faceoffs, his puck protection, his strength on the puck, his ability to control the game, all of those things, as important as they are on the offensive side of the puck, they're just as important on the defensive side,"" Predators defenseman PK Subban said.
""When he decides, he's going to come back into the zone, get the puck and take it out of the zone, he's going to do it.""

Whenever Eric Desjardins reunites with his 1993 Montreal Canadiens teammates, the topic of Canada's ongoing Stanley Cup drought doesn't come up in conversation.
""We don't see it that way. Canadian team, American team, it's just that we were part of the NHL,"" the former star defenseman said. ""Sure, it's been a while in Montreal, but we don't really talk about the 26 years.""
That's right. With the NHL playoffs set to open Wednesday, it will be going on 26 years since the Canadiens — or any other Canadian team — brought home the Cup.
Desjardins, who enjoyed a 17-year career split between Montreal and Philadelphia, chalks up the drought to NHL expansion across the United States and league-wide parity ushered in with the introduction of the salary cap in 2005.
""It's supposed to be our national sport, and we're supposed to be the best at it,"" said Desjardins, who's from Montreal. ""But now, the way the league's structured I think it could go anywhere. ... I think anybody can win it now. And I think it makes it more interesting.""
Still, the 49-year-old acknowledged a quarter century between Cups in Canada is far too long, and Desjardins can see himself rooting for any Canadian team making it to this year's Final.
""If the Final's between Pittsburgh and Winnipeg, yeah I would root, even though I like Pittsburgh,"" he said. ""But yeah, against Calgary, Winnipeg, I would cheer for the Canadian team.""
Canada's Cup hopes this spring rest on three teams — Calgary, Winnipeg and Toronto — to end the drought. Of course, most current Canadian-born NHL players weren't alive to see Desjardins and Co. celebrate their five-game series win over the Wayne Gretzky-led Los Angeles Kings.
Sabres forward Jason Pominville is among the exceptions.
He was 10 when his hometown Habs won, and Pominville still vividly recalls Game 2 of the series in which Desjardins scored all three goals in Montreal's 3-2 overtime win after the Canadiens lost the opener.
""I remember watching that and celebrating in my living room, and fist-pumping when he scored,"" Pominville said. ""I was a big fan of Gretzky, too. But when you're in Montreal, it's tough not to root for that team when you're growing up.""
In Montreal, there was a time when winning the Cup was considered a birthright. The Canadiens still top the list with 24 championships, 23 coming after the NHL was founded in 1917.
And yet, Montreal hasn't reached the Final since '93, while only five Canadian teams have done so; Vancouver is the only one to make two appearances during the drought, in 1994 and 2011.
Then there are the Maple Leafs, who haven't reached the Final since winning the Cup in 1967, the last year of the NHL's Original Six era.
The low point might have been the 2016 playoffs, the first since 1970 to not feature a Canadian team
This was not always the case. From 1927 to 1995, the lengthiest stretch for a Canadian team not appearing in the Final was two years. It last happened in 1991-92, when Pittsburgh won consecutive championships by beating Minnesota and Chicago.
As for Canada's lengthiest Cup drought before the '93 Habs, it was a six-year span from 1936-41.
The current drought has gone on for so long, former executive-turned broadcaster Brian Burke said the math simply doesn't add up.
""It doesn't make sense. There's 31 teams, so seven out of 31 teams, a Canadian team should win every four-and-a-half years,"" said Burke, who has worked in the front offices in Vancouver, Toronto and Calgary.
The problem, Burke said, is Canadian teams are at a disadvantage because many players don't want to play north of the border for several reasons.
The first, he said, is a lack of privacy and the amount of pressure placed on players to win north of the border. Burke said a large number of players, including Canadians, often list all seven Canadian teams on the no-trade clauses of their contracts.
""Even in Calgary, we had our lists where players got to put 10 teams on a no-trade list, and all the Canadian teams were on those lists,"" he said.
The second issue is Canada's taxation rate.
""There's no privacy. Horrible personal criticisms on social media, and then you take home way less money, so it's pretty easy,"" Burke said.
He can only imagine how much national attention will be paid to the next Canadian team to win it all.
""The next GM that wins a Cup in Canada, they'll be naming schools after him, and streets,"" Burke said.
Don't think Flames GM Brad Treliving hasn't given ending the drought some thought.
""Hey, that's all you dream about,"" he said, while attempting to keep the pressures of winning in Canada in perspective.
""You got to bed at night and it's no different than any other manager or any other person involved in the game: That's what you want to accomplish"" Treliving said. ""If you really put the energy and the effort into doing the right things, the results will come.""
Having lost in the Final twice, Desjardins can't remember a sweeter moment than winning the Cup.
""It's a reward that's indescribable,"" Desjardins said. ""When you win, you can share it. You share it with your teammates, you share it with the coaching staff.""
In Canada, it will be shared with an entire nation.

AUGUSTA, Ga. — Thirty-three years since Jack Nicklaus won the Masters at age 46, he remains the oldest claimant of the Green Jacket and perhaps only Phil Mickelson among this year's competitors is a realistic chance to break the Golden Bear's mark.
But 61-year-old Bernhard Langer thinks that sooner or later a grey-haired older player will win a major, perhaps even the Masters.
Nicklaus showed what is possible not just by winning here in 1986 but by going close 12 years later in what would have been a victory of historic proportions.
He was in contention until the final few holes before eventually finishing equal sixth, four shots back of winner Mark O'Meara.
But for all the talk of the value of experience at Augusta National, it has been an exception rather than the rule for players over 50 to contend for the Green Jacket.
Spaniard Miguel Jimenez finished fourth in 2014, three months after his 50th birthday, while the performance of Langer that same year was also impressive as he finished equal eighth at age 56.
Langer, never a particularly long hitter even in his prime, says the length of Augusta National eventually catches up with him over 72 holes.
He thinks a longer hitter is more likely to crack the code, someone who can still almost match distance with the young bucks from the tee.
""It's a lot harder for me now than 20-30 years ago,"" 1985 and 1993 champion Langer told Reuters.
""The course has gotten longer. The last few years I'm wearing out my three and four-iron and two-hybrid into these par-fours, whereas these young guys are hitting eight-irons.
""It's just hard to compete when you have that disadvantage.""
Langer gets a sobering baptism these days right off the bat at the par-four first, which now stretches to 445-yards.
When the hole plays into a cool north-westerly headwind, his drive invariably longs on the upslope, leaving him so far from the green that he has a blind second shot.
""I can't even see the flag (sometimes),"" he said.
Not even meticulous course management and a consistent putting stroke can make up for the 50 yards or more head start that he is giving younger players off the tee.
Even if his chances of winning are gone, Langer reckons someone of the ilk of 1992 champion Fred Couples or 2000 winner Vijay Singh stands a better chance of winning in his 50s.
Though he is not yet 50, Mickelson at age 48 and already a winner on the PGA Tour at Pebble Beach this year is a definite threat.
This week's field will include seven players aged 50 or older.
""Someone who is 20 yards longer than me, I think they still have a chance,"" Langer said.

AUGUSTA, Ga. — Augusta National chairman Fred Ridley on Wednesday threw cold water on the idea of one day hosting a women's Masters alongside the men's major.
Augusta National, which did not have a woman member until seven years ago, held its first women's tournament last week on the same course that will play host to the men's major.
Ridley, however, said the club has no plans to take another step and develop a women's Masters.
""To date, all of our grow-the-game initiatives have been focused on amateur golf and amateur golfers,"" said Ridley during the Augusta National chairman's annual address on Wednesday.
""In this particular case, we elected to conduct a women's amateur tournament for really that same reason, but we really wanted this to continue in a grow-the-game sort of mode.
""As to what we might do next, I'm still thinking about last Saturday, so I'll start thinking about that next week.""
For many the next logical step is for Augusta to organize a women's Masters. The idea, however, does not seem to excite the Augusta membership.
While Augusta National is best known as the home of the Masters, Ridley believes the club is better serving the amateur roots of co-founders Clifford Roberts and Bobby Jones and developing the sport by giving its name to a women's amateur competition.
""I think part of that kind of goes back to history and that is that Augusta National was founded, co-founded by the greatest amateur of all time,"" said Ridley.
After opening its doors to women members in 2012, Augusta National has since made efforts to promote and develop women's golf, but some in the game remain frustrated by what they see as the painfully slow pace of change.
Asked if the club's failure to confront its restrictive policies had stunted the growth of the women's game, Ridley said they could have done better.
""No matter what the issue is, you know, we can always look back and say we could do better,"" said Ridley. ""No question.
""But what my focus is, is on the future and where we are now and where we want to go. We learn from the past.
""But what I think is most productive is to look at where we are today, realize that throughout the history of this club, we have promoted the game and we have now identified a really important segment, the fastest growing segment of the game - that we can help make a difference.""

LONDON — Bernie Ecclestone may have been to more Formula One grands prix than any man alive but if the former supremo could shed the years and start over, he says he would probably embrace electric.
As the sport noisily celebrates its 1,000th world championship race at Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix, the 88-year-old Briton -- who once lambasted the current F1 engines as too quiet -- spoke of a more silent future.
Formula E, he said, was sure to grow with manufacturer involvement.
""It's a different form of entertainment but Formula E will begin to get much, much bigger and better, which is slowly what they are doing anyway,"" he told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday.
""And Formula One will suffer because of that.""
Asked which he would choose if 50 years younger and given the opportunity to run either, the Briton replied: ""My heart and everything is always with Formula One, so I'd have to say Formula One.
""But I'd be a little bit concerned about Formula E for sure.""
And if the head held sway over the heart, considering it purely as a business proposition?
""I think I'd have to say Formula E,"" answered Ecclestone. ""There's more chance there of big, big expansion and more chances commercially than there is of changing things in Formula One.""
MOVED ASIDE
For decades Ecclestone was Mr Formula One, the man who did the deals, turned the wheels and transformed the sport into today's billion dollar business.
Moved aside in 2017 when U.S.-based Liberty Media took control, and given the title of chairman emeritus, he will not be in Shanghai.
He was, however, present at the 1950 British Grand Prix at Silverstone that launched the world championship, competing in a 500cc Formula Three race at the old airfield.
""I can't remember whether I was impressed or not. I doubt it. I only wanted to get on with what I was supposed to be doing,"" he said.
Yet to attend a race this year, missing Bahrain after being laid low by a bout of food poisoning, he remains sceptical about whether China is really the 1,000th Formula One Grand Prix.
The tally being celebrated includes 11 editions of the Indianapolis 500, as well as races run to Formula Two regulations.
""It would be nice to be at the 1,000th, but as its not China I'm going to have to wait,"" he said.
""I never bothered to check and I only know what somebody told me a little while ago, but more than 800,"" added the billionaire when asked how many races he had attended. ""I don't know exactly how many.""
In 1958 he entered the Monaco Grand Prix, without starting.
""I entered it. Successfully entered,"" he said. ""Didn't successfully qualify. There used to be 16 cars to qualify in those days and I missed out.""
A number of races are seared in the memory from an era when motor racing was at its deadliest and drivers attended funerals with grim regularity.
""Maybe Casablanca where Mike (Hawthorn) won the (1958) championship and Stuart Lewis-Evans got badly burnt and subsequently died. That was a bad race. There's been lots of races like that,"" he said when asked which ones stood out.
""Monza when I lost (Austrian) Jochen Rindt, when he got killed (in 1970 and became the only posthumous world champion). People that are close to you, that you lose.""
POKER FACE
Famed for keeping a poker face, Ecclestone said there had been many times when the emotions bubbled through.
""Most times, actually. I manage not to show it too much,"" he said. ""Tears cried, that sort of thing? Very often. When things upset me.""
He still avoids funerals, and said jokingly he did not intend to be at his own either.
Ecclestone, who had managed Rindt, took a step back but returned as owner of the Brabham team a year later.
""When I bought Brabham, in one of the very first meetings I went to, they (the other team bosses) asked me would I look after things because they knew I was a good used car dealer, so maybe I'd be the right guy,"" he said. ""That's when it all started really.""
He singled out Britain's 1992 world champion Nigel Mansell as one of the best for creating column inches but put Frenchman Alain Prost, a four-times champion, as top of his list.
""He was always in a team that had a very strong other person in the team racing against him, so he didn't get a lot of help,"" he explained.
""He was on his own, in the car. The flag dropped to start the race and he was there to the end looking after all the things, the gearbox, engines and brakes. Today these things don't happen like that.""
Ecclestone could see five-times champion Lewis Hamilton matching Michael Schumacher's record of seven championships and 91 wins but said his money was still on Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel to triumph this year.
""I thought he was going to win easy,"" he said of a prediction that has looked shaky since team mate Charles Leclerc outshone the German in Bahrain.
""I (still) think he's going to win. But not easy.""

DALLAS — Dallas Mavericks star Dirk Nowitzki announced his retirement from the NBA after a record 21 seasons with the same franchise, giving the fans the secret he had kept all season after scoring 30 points in his final home game, a 120-109 win over the Phoenix Suns on Tuesday night.
The 40-year-old showed his emotion during the game, fighting back tears just before action resumed at the start of the second quarter following a tribute video that detailed his holiday visit to a children's hospital.
Nowitzki's final basket in Dallas was his signature one-legged fadeaway from slightly above the free throw line for a 120-108 lead with 1:22 remaining after the Mavericks had let a 30-point halftime cushion get cut to four in the fourth quarter.
After speeches from Larry Bird and others he idolized growing up in Germany, Nowitzki told the crowd, ""As you guys might expect, this is my last home game.""
The sellout crowd that followed owner Mark Cuban's orders by showing up early chanted ""M-V-P"" and ""One more year"" throughout the game. But after he made the announcement, the chant turned to ""Thank you, Dirk"" as Cuban started to speak.
The 14-time All-Star has one game remaining, Dallas' season finale at San Antonio on Wednesday night.
""This is obviously super, super emotional,"" Nowitzki said. ""Just too many people to really thank. I put you guys on a helluva ride with a lot of ups and downs, and you guys always stuck with me and supported me, so I appreciate it.""
Larger-than-life placards of Nowitzki's face were perched on most of the roughly 20,000 seats at American Airlines Center, and a huge mural hung over one of the entrances to the arena.
Nowitzki, a few steps slower than in his prime and a role player on a team now led by rookie sensation and fellow European Luka Doncic, was serenaded in every road arena like it was a farewell tour.
Last month, he gave the home folks the thrill of passing Wilt Chamberlain to regain sixth on the career scoring list. Nowitzki reached that spot last season, but LeBron James passed him. Nowitzki, who led the Mavericks to their only championship in 2011, has 31,540 points with one game left.
The NBA's highest-scoring foreign-born player broke Kobe Bryant's record of 20 seasons with the same franchise, although it took longer than expected because of setbacks following ankle surgery that sidelined Nowitzki for the first 26 games. Bryant retired from the Lakers three years ago.

Luke Heimlich, the former Oregon State star who had failed to land a job in professional baseball after the revelation that he had pleaded guilty to
sexually molesting his 6-year-old niece when he was 15
, quietly made his pro debut in Mexico on Tuesday.
Even after Heimlich signed a deal with the Tecolotes de los Dos Laredos of the Liga Mexicana de Béisbol last month, it was unclear whether he would be permitted to play for them: T
he president of the Mexican league immediately cast doubt on the approval of the contract
, citing Heimlich’s past conduct and the message the league might send by employing him. As recently as Monday,
The Laredo Morning Times reported
that the team said it was awaiting clearance from the league to use Heimlich.
But a day later, Heimlich, 23, was on the mound facing the Algodoneros Union Laguna at the Estadio de la Revolución in Torreón, Mexico. He allowed two runs in
a five-inning start
and struck out five batters.
The league had actually informed the Tecolotes on Saturday that Heimlich’s contract had been authorized, the Tecolotes owner José Antonio Mansur said in a phone interview on Wednesday. The league president, Javier Salinas, had not responded to repeated requests for comment since Saturday, when a line in
the league’s official transactions
stated that Heimlich had been assigned to the Tecolotes. On Friday, Salinas had said in a message on WhatsApp that a decision on Heimlich’s contract had not yet been made.
Salinas had questioned the move when Heimlich signed with the Tecolotes in March, saying he had to “protect the image of the league.” The team said it was attracted to Heimlich because of his low-90s fastball as a left-hander, and said it felt he deserved a chance at a pro career after serving his legal penalty. But the signing drew criticism from the victim’s family, and Salinas indicated the league would have to closely examine it.
“The player has to have irreproachable conduct and be a good representative of the team and the league,” he said last month. “Like any league, we have to verify that all of our entrants have good conduct. We are an example to a lot of boys and girls.”
The Tecolotes,
who have an unusual arrangement with home stadiums on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border
, were the second professional team to sign Heimlich. In August, the Lamigo Monkeys in Taiwan
reached a deal
with the pitcher, but after public outcry, the Chinese Professional Baseball League declared that he could not play there because of his criminal background and the potential effect on the league’s image.
All 30 major league teams passed on drafting or signing Heimlich, although all were allowed to do so.
Last May,
in an interview
with The New York Times, Heimlich denied that he had committed the crime he admitted to, saying he had pleaded guilty to quickly dispense with the case and for the sake of the family. The victim’s mother, whose name is being withheld to protect her daughter’s identity, has maintained that the girl’s account is truthful.
As part of a plea deal, reached when Heimlich was 16, one of two charges was dropped. He was placed on two years’ probation, took court-ordered classes, wrote a letter apologizing to his niece and was forced to register for five years as a Level 1 sex offender, a designation the State of Washington uses for someone considered of low risk to the community and unlikely to become a repeat offender. His juvenile records are sealed.
Mansur, the Tecolotes’ owner, said the team and the league had either spoken with Heimlich or requested paperwork regarding his case. Last month, the league, which is affiliated with Minor League Baseball and is considered Class AAA, even took the unusual step of asking Heimlich to sign a letter vowing good behavior.
When city officials in Laredo, Tex., learned of Heimlich’s signing, they sent letters to the team notifying them of a city ordinance that prohibits sex offenders at city parks and Uni-Trade Stadium, where the Tecolotes play in Texas. The team provided records from Oregon that showed Heimlich no longer needed to register as a sex offender because his juvenile conviction was expunged, said Rafael Benavides, a spokesman for the city of Laredo.
“Our Laredo Police Department also confirmed that the player’s background check reflects no conviction criminal history information in the Washington State Patrol files,” Benavides said in a statement. “As it stands, the player is not required to register with the State of Texas and has an affirmative defense under our city ordinance.”
Heimlich would have his first chance to play in Texas next week when the Tecolotes return from a road trip.
“There is nothing that could have prevented him from signing in the league,” Mansur said in Spanish, adding, “in reality, I hope the past is left behind for the future.”

BOSTON — Terrence Ross had 26 points, Nikola Vucevic added 25 points and 12 rebounds and the Orlando Magic rallied past the Boston Celtics 116-108 on Sunday night to clinch their first playoff berth in seven years.
Evan Fournier added 24 points for Orlando (41-40), which last made the postseason during the 2011-12 season. Sunday's victory also gave the Magic their first regular-season sweep over Boston since 1996-97.
Even with the loss, the Celtics (48-33) clinched at least the fourth seed and home-court advantage in the first round of the playoffs just before tip-off. That came courtesy of Brooklyn's win over Indiana.
Kyrie Irving had 23 points for Boston. Al Horford finished with 18 points and Gordon Hayward added 16 off the bench.
The Magic erased a 13-point first-half deficit and took an 83-78 lead into the fourth quarter. They kept it going, starting the final period on an 11-2 run, which included nine points by Ross.
Boston responded with run of its own and tied the game at 106 on a 3-pointer by Irving with 2:50 remaining.
The Magic kept attacking.
Fournier got free in the lane and dunked over Terry Rozier to put the Magic back in front. The Celtics turned it over on their next possession. That was followed by an Aaron Gordon layup on the other end that made it 110-106.
Celtics coach Brad Stevens said before the game that the Indiana outcomes wouldn't affect how much he played his starters against Orlando.
But there clearly was interest in Boston's locker room beforehand, as evidenced in the television tuned to the Pacers-Nets matchup.
As for his rotations, Stevens was true to his word and played his starters their normal minutes.
It proved costly.
Jayson Tatum limped off the court at the six-minute mark of the first quarter with a left shin contusion and did not return.
Marcus Smart left with 6:15 remaining in the third, helped off by trainers and holding his left side after banging hips with Vucevic. He was diagnosed with a left hip contusion.
Stevens will almost certainly rest both during Tuesday's regular-season finale at Washington.
TIP-INS
Magic: Vucevic had his 60th double-double of the season.
Celtics: Hayward has now scored in double-figures in eight consecutive games.
UP NEXT
Magic: Regular-season finale at Charlotte Tuesday.
Celtics: Regular-season finale at Washington Wednesday.

RALEIGH, N.C. — They traded punches with Evander Holyfield. They dunked a basketball on ice. They flopped around like beached whales.
The Carolina Hurricanes have done plenty of unusual things this season, and here is one more: They are preparing for their first playoff series in a decade.
That team dubbed a ""bunch of jerks"" over their wild, choreographed post-victory celebrations hopes to surge — or, perhaps more fittingly, Storm Surge — all the way to the Stanley Cup.
The Hurricanes, who open their first best-of-seven playoff series since 2009 on Thursday night at defending Cup champion Washington, are walking the fine line between savoring their rare-for-them accomplishment while not being completely satisfied with just making the field of 16.
""You never know when you're going to be back in this situation,"" 37-year-old captain Justin Williams said, ""because making the playoffs is hard — as people in this area know.""
Oh, do they know.
It has been nine seasons since the Hurricanes last skated in a springtime game that mattered. Only two franchises have gone longer between postseason appearances — the Florida Panthers from 2001-11 and the Edmonton Oilers from 2007-16, with each missing the playoffs for 10 straight seasons.
Yet first-year coach Rod Brind'Amour isn't just happy to be here.
""We're certainly expecting more — this isn't what we signed up for,"" he said. ""We all understand it's a huge task, but we're not going into this series not expecting to win, that's for sure.""
The only current Carolina player who was on the ice for the Hurricanes' last postseason series was center Jordan Staal — who at the time played for Pittsburgh, which swept those Hurricanes in the Eastern Conference finals.
To finally end that drought, Carolina changed just about everything, from the players on the ice all the way up to the team owner. Tom Dundon bought a majority stake in the team from longtime owner Peter Karmanos Jr. last January, then promoted Don Waddell to general manager and hired Brind'Amour — who, as captain of the title-winning team in 2006, was the first player to hoist the Stanley Cup — as head coach.
Along the way, the team's culture changed. Williams was selected as team captain after a failed experiment last year in which Staal and Justin Faulk shared the captaincy, and the players became more accountable to each other.
""Guys expect more out of themselves and expect more out of each other,"" Williams said. ""And when we challenge each other to be better players, that's the only way to improve as a team.""
They're also having more fun after games, thanks to those Storm Surges.
Each one started with a slow, exaggerated overhead clap and ended with a different skit or activity. They celebrated March Madness by bringing a portable basketball hoop onto the ice and Trevor van Riemsdyk threw down a one-handed dunk . When Holyfield visited as a guest, they brought him onto the ice and the former boxing champ pretended to spar with Jordan Martinook. They marked Hartford Whalers night by flopping around on the ice like whales.
And when veteran hockey broadcaster Don Cherry ripped the celebrations and called the Hurricanes a ""bunch of jerks,"" they turned the insult into a rallying cry — even selling T-shirts with the slogan at the team shop.
Even as Williams announced the team's decision to halt the Surges late in the season, he left the door open for their return by calling them ""unpredictable.""
So was this playoff appearance. Just a few months ago, the Hurricanes were 15-17-5 on Dec. 30 and one point out of last place in the East.
Since then, they have gone 31-12-2.
""A lot of people that didn't watch our team all year, they were, 'What happened?' and I don't know that anything happened,"" Brind'Amour said. ""The puck just started to go in. I still think the first 25 games were the best segment of our season, and yet our record didn't show it, so what do I know? ... I can't tell you the change. When pucks started going in, I think you could see they had a little bit more swagger.""
So now, on a day usually reserved for melting the ice at PNC Arena, they were doing something different to it — placing the playoff logos inside the blue lines.
For Williams, who scored the winning goal in Game 7 of Carolina's Cup run 13 years ago and came back before last season to try to bring the franchise back to those heights, it's particularly satisfying.
""I think the atmosphere's going to be electric,"" Williams said. ""Still to this day, (Game 7 was) one of the loudest buildings I've ever been a part of. And playoff hockey coming back to the area, people are going to be ready. I know that.""

AMHERST, Mass. — When Coach Greg Carvel arrived at University of Massachusetts-Amherst from St. Lawrence University in 2016, he inherited a hockey program that had just two winning seasons since 1995 and had won only 11 conference games in Hockey East the previous three seasons.
“We were the joke of Hockey East for a while there,” said Kurt Keats, the only senior on the team who has been in the program for four years. “We definitely were not a source of pride for the university.”
But this season, the Minutemen won their first Hockey East regular-season title and advanced to their first men’s Frozen Four.
They will play eight-time national champion Denver University in the semifinals on Thursday night in Buffalo, with the winner facing the defending champion Minnesota Duluth or Providence in the championship game Saturday night.
Almost from the moment he arrived on campus, Carvel, who on Tuesday was named the national coach of the year, promised a change in culture and fortune for a program that was often overshadowed by in-state rival UMass-Lowell, announcing, “We’re not ZooMass, we’re NewMass.”
Still, in his first season, UMass had only five victories and lost its last 17 games. Last year UMass finished 17-20-2, but did win its first-round series in the Hockey East playoffs.
Signs of a breakthrough came early this season. The Minutemen won at Ohio State, ranked No. 1 at the time, in its second game, then rode a nine-game winning streak to the top spot, sweeping No. 4 Providence along the way. They are ranked fourth in the most recent poll, and are the only Division I men’s team that did not lose consecutive games this season.
UMass takes a 30-9-0 record to the Frozen Four, but after earning its berth in Buffalo, even Carvel admitted, “We’re way ahead of schedule.”
The Minutemen produced this surprising season with
one of the youngest rosters
in college hockey. Of its 25 skaters, 19 are freshmen and sophomores, including the first-year Finnish goalie Filip Lindberg.
Lindberg took over the starting job from the sophomore Matt Murray, who had won 20 games, in the Hockey East quarterfinals sweep against New Hampshire and has posted three shutouts since. In the N.C.A.A. East Regional, UMass outscored Harvard and Notre Dame by a combined 8-0.
The team’s marquee player, though, is the sophomore defenseman Cale Makar, the No. 4 overall pick in the 2017 N.H.L. draft. He is expected to join the Colorado Avalanche in the Stanley Cup playoffs as soon as his college season ends.
Along with St. Cloud State’s Jimmy Schuldt and Harvard’s Adam Fox, also defensemen, Makar is a finalist for the Hobey Baker Award, given to the most outstanding player in college hockey. The winner will be announced on Saturday.
Carvel left no doubt on how he thinks the vote should go,
saying last week of Makar:
“He’s the best player in college hockey. It’s not even close.”
According to Brian Willsie, the development consultant for the Avalanche, Makar has all the qualities necessary for success in the N.H.L.
“To say he’s a mobile defenseman is an understatement,” Willsie said. “His skating is what blows you away. It’s on a different level.”
With 16 goals and 32 assists, Makar, a native of Calgary, Alberta, is tied for third in the nation in scoring. With three points in Buffalo, he would become the first defenseman to lead the nation in points.
“In tight games, in the third periods, he knows how to win games,” Willsie said. “He’s such a driven, focused kid.”
Northeastern Coach Jim Madigan has seen enough of Makar the last two seasons to say, “ He has all the makings of a 15-year pro.”
Makar anchors a defense that is UMass’ strength. Not only are the Minutemen sixth in the country in goals against average (1.97), but their defensemen have accounted for 39 goals and 87 assists, powering an offense that is third in the country at 3.77 goals per game.
Forward Brett Boeing said UMass’s aggressive style starts with its defense.
“We want to force turnovers and then control the play,” he said. “When we’re playing well, you can see the frustration on the other team.”
Carvel, 48, was not thinking about immediately reaching Frozen Fours when he took over the program in 2016.
UMass had been a Division II program when it dropped men’s hockey in 1979. The sport didn’t return to Amherst until the 8,389-seat Mullins Center opened in 1993. After one year as an independent, when it won 20 games, UMass joined Hockey East for the 1994-95 season. UMass received an at-large bid to its first N.C.A.A tournament in 2007, losing to Maine in the quarterfinals.
Despite losing records in all but two of its Division I seasons before this one, the Minutemen have produced N.H.L. players, among them goalie Jonathan Quick and forward Conor Sheary, who have won Stanley Cups.
Carvel’s first objective was to identify the right players to take the team forward.
Keats, who played 35 games as a freshman, was one of those players under the microscope.
“When he came in, we knew he wanted to weed guys out,” Keats said.
That first season, Keats said, players bought in to Carvel’s message, “but we didn’t see the results.”
For the 2017-18 season, Carvel brought in 13 freshmen, including Makar and fellow defenseman Mario Ferraro, the No. 49 overall pick by the San Jose Sharks in 2017. A different attitude arrived with them.
“You could see something starting to develop,” Keats said.
In a season of few regrets, Carvel said he wished success had come earlier for players like Keats and Boeing, who were around when the program was floundering.
“I think they’re a little wistful about that, how success came late in their time at UMass,” he said. “But they will always carry that they were part of the group that turned this program around.”

AUGUSTA Ga. (Reuters) - Rickie Fowler returned to Augusta National on Monday with the heartbreak of last year's runner-up Masters finish firmly behind him and brimming with confidence that a breakthrough major win is closer than ever.
Fowler, a five-times winner on the PGA Tour, has three runner-up finishes to show from 36 major appearances and as a result finds his name on the list of the best players who have never won one of golf's four blue riband events.
But such talk does not discourage the 30-year-old American, who comes into the year's first major in solid form and among the favorites to claim a Green Jacket.
""Compared to four, five, whatever years ago, yeah, I'm more ready than I've ever been,"" Fowler told reporters. ""Not saying that I can sit up here and tell you I'm definitely going to go win, but I like my chances.
""I love this place. I know I can play well around here. For me, every time I get to play it, it's fun ... I get to use my imagination around here.""
Last year Fowler started the final round at Augusta National five shots behind overnight leader Patrick Reed but a sparkling back nine, which included a birdie at the last, saw him card a five-under-par 67.
The strong finish was not enough as Reed managed to hang on for a one-stroke victory but Fowler, after getting over the pain of another near miss, was able to take plenty of positives from his performance.
""The way I executed on the back nine Sunday last year was definitely something I pull from, and it was a lot of fun to be in the mix, birdieing 18, to make Patrick earn it a bit,"" said Fowler.
""But I was just a little bit too far back, and Patrick put together a strong week of golf.
""So it was fun. It was great to be in the mix, and like I said, have a chance. But time to do one better.""
Fowler's performance at last year's Masters also marked the first time in eight starts at Augusta National that he recorded four par or better rounds.
He has made a strong start to 2019, including a win at the Phoenix Open in February, and is fresh off a share of 17th place at the Valero Texas Open where Fowler said he ticked a lot of boxes when it came to having his golf game where he wanted it.
""Some guys don't like to play (the week) before a major. Sometimes they like to get work in at home with their coach or work on the game and spend time on the driving range,"" said Fowler.
""For me, playing and just seeing where the state of my game's at and what I may need to work at makes Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday a lot more efficient. I know exactly what I want to do.""

MINNEAPOLIS — Virginia lost its poise in a monumental first-round loss a year ago and appeared to be in trouble again.
A 10-point lead against Auburn, gone in a flash of Bryce Brown 3-pointers. A trip to the national title game, less than two seconds away from being snatched away in another disappointing collapse.
Then a big call by an official and three of the gutsiest free throws in the NCAA Tournament.
Virginia and its pack-line defense are headed to the title game after all.
Kyle Guy hit three free throws with 0.6 seconds left and Virginia survived Auburn's late-game rally for a 63-62 in the Final Four Saturday night.
Virginia (34-3) stymied the Tigers and Brown all night, building the lead to 57-47 with more than five minutes left.
But one antidote to Virginia's pack-line D is a hot shooter. Purdue's Carsen Edwards proved that in the Sweet 16, though the Cavaliers still managed to pull out the victory.
Brown almost shot the Cavaliers back to Charlottesville. The senior guard hit three 3-pointers during a 14-0 run to put Auburn up 61-47 with 17 seconds left.
A year after being bounced by No. 16 seed UMBC in a history-making loss, Virginia was on the verge of an epic collapse.
The team that couldn't get it done was about to add another notch to that resume.
Not so fast.
Trailing by 4, the Cavaliers kept their composure as Auburn (30-10) burned through its last two fouls before hitting the bonus.
Virginia nearly lost its chance when Ty Jerome fumbled the ball — and may have double dribbled — and called timeout with 1.5 seconds left to draw up one last-ditch play.
The Cavaliers got the ball into a cutting Guy, who turned and put up a shot that came up short.
The noise inside U.S. Bank Stadium made it so the whistle couldn't be heard, so the Tigers came rushing onto the court.
Virginia's bench saw referee James Breeding's hand in the air and waited. Auburn coach Bruce Pearl, who didn't, started stomping and screaming when the officials came to review the monitor, checking if it was a 3-point shot.
His team's season on the line, Guy stepped to the free throw line, facing three of the biggest free throws in college basketball history.
First one, in. Second one, same.
Auburn called timeout, hoping to freeze Virginia's junior guard.
Yeah, right.
Calm under the most intense pressure imaginable, Guy calmly sank the third free throw to put the Cavaliers in the lead.
After Auburn's last-ditch attempted failed, Virginia's players rushed the court as the Tigers dropped to the floor.
Known for wilting under NCAA Tournament pressure, the Cavaliers had pulled off the biggest win in program history.
One more time and they'll be national champions for the first time.

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — Takuma Sato will start from the pole at Barber Motorsports Park and Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing grabbed the first two spots.
Sato claimed the eighth pole of his career on Saturday, beating out teammate Graham Rahal. It was Sato's first pole since 2017 at Pocono. That's the year the Japanese driver won the Indianapolis 500.
Team Penske was shut out of the Fast Six qualifying group for the first time since Long Beach in 2014.
Penske had dominated at the 2.3-mile, 17-turn road course, with six victories in nine years, but had rare qualifying struggles.
That included two-time winner and four-time pole sitter Will Power, two-time defending champion and series points leader Josef Newgarden, and Simon Pagenaud, who won in 2016.
Five-time race runner-up Scott Dixon qualified third, followed by James Hinchcliffe, Sebastien Bourdais and Spencer Pigot. Pigot had never made the Fast Six.

AUGUSTA, Ga. — NCAA champion Jennifer Kupcho became the first woman to win at Augusta National with a charge on the back nine so often seen at the home of the Masters.
Trailing by two with six holes to play, Kupcho boldly went for the green on the par-5 13th that set up eagle. That carried her to a sensational closing stretch and a three-shot victory over close friend Maria Fassi in the Augusta National Women's Amateur.
Kupcho, a senior at Wake Forest, closed with a 5-under 67, playing the final six holes in 5 under.
It capped off a big week at a tournament that Augusta National, which didn't have a female member until 2012, announced last year to help provide a spark for women's golf.

AUGUSTA, Ga. — Bryson DeChambeau seemed about as excited as a mad scientist gets as Masters week kicked off, which meant he stopped just short of jumping for joy.
Not to worry. The jump might come Sunday for DeChambeau, assuming the planets align, the morning dew on the golf ball is at proper levels and putts don't bounce off the flagstick.
If not, well, all bets are off.
Golf's most noted iconoclast — the only one in the field with irons that are all the same length — tees off in his third Masters not only with visions of a green jacket but a legitimate chance of being in the mix late Sunday afternoon.
And why not? DeChambeau has won five times in the past year, rising from 62nd in the world golf rankings to sixth while building a reputation as both a crafty calculator and steely closer.
Not only that, he discovered something last week — just what he won't say — that might make him just as effective with his short wedges as he has been with the rest of his game.
""I've had some disadvantages with a couple of the irons I've had for a little bit,"" DeChambeau said. ""And just being able to practice and getting comfortable and seeing the ball flights come out the proper way for the first time ever in my life is pretty cool.""
That's DeChambeau. Always tweaking, always studying.
He's called the mad scientist for a reason. DeChambeau's swing is a study in the science of single plane, he plays irons that are all the same length so everything can be repeatable, and he studies contours in greens like they were clues to where the late union leader Jimmy Hoffa is buried.
What he would like to be called is Masters champion. And that's why he was working last week with new wedges — still the same length as his other irons — in search of a breakthrough that might trim a shot or two off at Augusta National.
""I've been fortunate to win a lot of tournaments using the equipment that I've had so far and it's been great,"" DeChambeau said. ""But there's always that little bit of room for improvement. So we've been working quite heavily this past week in trying to figure out some things that could give me an advantage this week.""
What may not be an advantage for DeChambeau is that there's no green mapping book for players at the Masters. Instead of staring at diagrams of contours on a green to see how a putt breaks, he'll have to rely on looking at the contours themselves.
But he's got a plan for that, too, just like he has a plan for most things in his golf career.
""I have to practice a lot more hitting breaking putts because I can't just bring out my compass and go, oh, it's 3 percent and here it is,"" DeChambeau said. ""I have to look at and walk around and go, 'OK, I'm acclimated to 3 percent.'""
If the calculations are all a bit too much to understand, don't worry. Arnold Palmer would have been confused, too, and he won four green jackets.
Technology, though, is the new wave in golf, and DeChambeau is its leader in the clubhouse. He uses words in conversation that are heard more often in physics classes than golf courses and talks about scientific advances in golf like other players might be discussing the latest in movies.
That includes spending more time than usual this week figuring out exactly what moisture on the clubface will do at Augusta National, where rain is forecast during the week. To make sure he's doing it right, DeChambeau sprays balls on the practice range with salt water to see how they react.
""That's going to affect the way the ball reacts on the face,"" he said. ""You know, there's a percentage to that, and we have to account for that. If you don't, you're going to hit it to 30, 40 feet, instead of 10 feet.""
It may be too much information for casual golf fans, or even many of DeChambeau's fellow pros. No one else has really embraced his thoughts on swing plane and single length irons, but DeChambeau says he hopes some children taking up the game try and adopt it.
For now, the 25-year-old is focused on his wedges and the greens at Augusta National. He first came here as an amateur in 2016 and thought he had a chance at winning before hitting it into the bushes on 18 on his second day, and only broke par one round last year before finishing in a tie for 38th.
Whatever happens, one thing is for sure.
If DeChambeau doesn't win, he can't just blame it on bad luck.

SANYA, China — Officials at the Sanya Championship said Sunday that 28-year-old Malaysian golfer Arie Irawan died in his hotel room from ""apparent natural causes,"" and the PGA Tour Series-China canceled the final round of the tournament.
The PGA Tour Series-China said in a statement that Irawan missed the 36-hole cut Friday in the tournament at Sanya Yalong Bay Golf Club. It said the official coroner's report had not been completed.
""The PGA Tour and the China Golf Association grieve at this loss of one of our members and share sincere condolences with Arie's wife, Marina, and his parents, Ahmad and Jeny,"" the tour said. ""When something of this magnitude occurs in the golf world, we all grieve at the same time.
""Out of respect for the family, officials canceled the final round of the Sanya Championship, the tournament becoming a 54-hole event.""
The PGA Tour China had an ""In Memorium"" photo of Irawan prominently displayed on its website Sunday.
American Trevor Sluman led after 54 holes with an 18-under total of 198. Three Americans — Matt Gilchrest, Max McGreevy and Michael Perras — were tied for second, two strokes behind.
Going into the tournament, Sluman, who finished ninth on the China Tour's 2018 Order of Merit, was seeking his first win in a four-day professional event since graduating from the University of Louisville in 2015.

TAMPA, Fla. — Kim Mulkey climbed the steps to the dais at the Final Four, six-month-old grandson Kannon Reid in tow, and the baby's proud mother watching from the side.
Family has always been important to one of the nation's most successful women's college basketball coaches, though never more than the past couple of seasons with Mulkey coping with the death of her first grandchild while also continuing to win big at Baylor.
The Lady Bears (36-1) will seek their third national title on Sunday, facing defending champion Notre Dame (35-3) in the first NCAA final featuring a pair of female head coaches since Mulkey and the Fighting Irish's Muffet McGraw also met in 2012.
The matchup comes just days after McGraw made headlines by saying she will not hire male assistants in the future because she feels there should be more coaching opportunities for women in the sport.
Mulkey said Saturday that she supports McGraw, but quibbled with the idea of ""never"" considering a man for an opening.
Family is a reason.
Mulkey's daughter, Makenzie Fuller, is a former Baylor player, as well as Kannon Reid's mother and serves as an associate director of basketball operations for the Lady Bears.
The coach's son, Kramer Robertson, is a shortstop for the St. Louis Cardinals' Double-A Springfield affiliate.
""I understand her points, without a doubt. But I'm of the belief, I want the best person for the job,"" Mulkey said. ""I have a son, and I would be honored if my son wanted to coach next to me. (McGraw) has a son. I think she would be honored if he wanted to coach women's basketball,"" Mulkey added. ""So I tend to stay away from saying the word 'never.'""
McGraw walked back her comments, while stressing there's absolutely a need to have more women on coaching staffs.
""I just hired a male video coordinator. I have just hired a male strength coach. I'm not opposed to hiring men. I just think that women need those opportunities, and those opportunities right now are going to men,"" McGraw said.
""We keep looking at ways to get our young graduates and alums into the game. There's no room for them in the game,"" she added. ""Women are leaving the game because of the lack of a work-life balance.""
The Notre Dame coach cited UConn's Geno Auriemma as an example of someone who's done a ""great job"" in creating opportunities.
""He always has an all-female staff. ... When you look and see more men than women on a woman's staff, I think that's not the optics that I would like to see.""
Mulkey carried her grandson, who born last October, onto the podium after beating Oregon in Friday night's national semifinals.
Her son, in his third minor league season since being a fourth-round draft pick of the Cardinals out of LSU, tried to keep up with what was going in his mother's game while playing one of his own at Northwest Arkansas.
""He's playing during our game. He's in the on-deck circle. He has the trainer get on the app, it was a tie ball, whatever, late in the game,"" Mulkey said, noting Kramer was waiting for a thumbs-up or thumbs-down signal about the Baylor result.
""He said I'm freaking out there. I can't focus,"" Mulkey added. ""He said I have a line drive hit at me, I field it, get it. I see a thumbs up. All the guys on the team are just, like, going nuts. You would have thought we won the national championship.""
As associate director of basketball operations, Fuller is in Tampa, Florida, for the ride.
Only a week into the 2017-18 season, she lost her unborn child about 18 weeks into her pregnancy.
The baby with two life-threatening birth defects had no heartbeat when Fuller went to a doctor's appointment, and the baby girl was delivered after labor was induced.
Kannon Reid was born last October.
""You bet I'm going to hang onto him. Holding a child up here is a heck of a lot more touching than holding one right here that's deceased,"" Mulkey said, extending her hands. ""I've done both in the last year and a half. ... In my world, anybody will tell you it is about family first.""
The view from the side of the podium is exhilarating, too.
""Oh my goodness. There's nothing like it,"" Fuller said. ""Being a mom and seeing your child is the best feeling in the world, and just getting to experience this fantastic run with him and have him up there with my mom and myself, all the pictures and memories that are being made. It's unbelievable.""

TORONTO — Jonathan Osorio scored in the 76th minute, lifting Toronto FC to a 2-2 tie with the Chicago Fire on Saturday.
Toronto (3-0-1) was the only MLS team with a perfect record coming into the day. It extended its undefeated streak against Chicago to 10 dating to Sept. 26, 2015.
Jozy Altidore scored for Toronto in the first half and set up Osorio's tying score. Positioned on the flank near the Chicago penalty box, the burly striker twisted and turned Jeremiah Gutjahr before delivering a perfect cross for Osorio to head in.
C.J. Sapong and Nemanja Nikolic scored for Chicago (1-2-2) before 26,256 at BMO Field.
Spanish playmaker Alejandro Pozuelo, who dazzled in his MLS debut last week with two goals and an assist, set up Altidore's goal in the 31st minute. He made a perfect cross to the American, who headed it in at the far post for his third of the season.
Chicago drew even in first-half stoppage time after Gutjahr's long ball found Sapong, who held off Chris Mavinga and then beat goalkeeper Alex Bono.
A Toronto giveaway set the scene for Chicago's go-ahead goal in the 62nd minute. Richie Laryea lost the ball in midfield and Aleksandar Katai raced through the area where the Toronto fullback was supposed to be. With no one closing him down, he headed toward the penalty box and sent in a cross that Nikolic tapped in as Toronto defenders watched.

DETROIT — Jeff Skinner scored twice to reach the 40-goal mark for the first time in his career and the Buffalo Sabres closed out their season with a 7-1 win over the Detroit Red Wings on Saturday.
Rookie defenseman Rasmus Dahlin had a goal and an assist, and Sam Reinhart, Conor Sheary, Zemgus Girgensons and Brandon Montour scored for Buffalo, which finished the season with 76 points. Jack Eichel and Rasmus Ristolainen each had two assists, and Linus Ullmark made 23 saves.
Anthony Mantha scored for Detroit, which finished with 74 points. Jimmy Howard stopped shots 21 shots before being pulled in favor of Kaden Fulcher in the second period. Fulcher made nine saves in his NHL debut.
The Sabres finished out of the playoffs and in the draft lottery after starting the season 17-6-2 and ranking first overall on Nov. 27. They finished the season going 3-13-2.
Buffalo's second-half collapse has raised questions regarding coach Phil Housley's future two years into his tenure with an overall record of 58-84-22. Sabres general manager Jason Botterill backed Housley in February, but that was before the team struggled down the stretch and missed the playoffs for the eighth straight year.
Red Wings coach Jeff Blashill signed a two-year contract extension on Tuesday. Despite missing the playoffs for the third straight season, general manager Ken Holland likes the way the Red Wings have competed in most games and the way young players have developed under Blashill.
Reinhart opened the scoring 3:22 into the game with his 22nd goal. Dahlin scored his ninth goal, on the power play, with 8:39 left in the opening period.
Mantha collected his career-high 25th goal on the power play with 4:49 left in the first.
The Sabres scored three goals in the second period to break the game open.
Sheary got his 14th goal at 8:37. Skinner his first of the game with 8:31 left in the middle period, and Girgensons scored his fifth goal, just 1:18 later, chasing Howard.
Skinner added his second goal of the game, 40th of the season and 200th of his career, and Montour picked up his eighth goal on a power play in the third period.
NOTES: Detroit C Dylan Larkin led the team in goals (32), assists (41), points (73) and penalty minutes (75) and became the first Red Wings player to lead in each category in the same season since Johnny Sheppard did it for the Detroit Cougars in 1926-27, the franchise's first season in the NHL. . Buffalo star C Eichel reached career highs with 28 goals, 54 assists and 82 points.

OAKLAND, Calif. — DeMarcus Cousins shoves off assistant coach Jarron Collins and goes hard for the basket. He swishes a 3-pointer from up top, then hits a jumper inside the arc on the right wing. Cousins drives to the hoop and makes a shot from close range, then a turnaround jumper goes in before he moves to the left side to begin the sequence again.
Long before the rest of the Golden State regulars have taken the court for pregame warmups, there is Cousins, earbuds in, meticulously focused on his preparation. In the locker room, he is one of the first to pull on his game jersey.
Cousins can't wait for his first playoff chance.
""It's been a long time coming for him,"" Collins said. ""I definitely think he's excited and he's ready for the moment to play on the biggest stage. Obviously there's a lot that goes into it, the preparation, the dedication.""
This is why Cousins approached the Warriors last summer and asked for a chance, even though he was working back from season-ending surgery for a torn left Achilles tendon. Cousins joined the two-time defending champions for $5.3 million, a low-risk move for general manager Bob Myers that has worked out beautifully for both sides.
""I never thought this situation would happen, but it's happened,"" Cousins said. ""This is my team, and anybody that's followed me before this moment, you know how I fight for my team. It's the same thing. Step on them, you're stepping on me.""
Cousins patiently worked back from a nearly yearlong absence after getting hurt in January 2018 with New Orleans, calling it one of the hardest things he has gone through emotionally and physically in his career. He made his Warriors debut Jan. 18 on the road against the Clippers, showing quickly he would make a big impact on both ends of the floor.
The four-time All-Star center's shooting stroke returned in a hurry. For him, finally getting back was largely conditioning and gaining strength in the leg to handle the rigors, pace and low-post pounding of an NBA game again.
""What does he call it, the Resurgence?"" Stephen Curry said. ""... We like his fire. In terms of the playoffs, it's going to be amazing, it's his first run, it's going to be good.""
The 28-year-old Cousins steadily found a groove and more minutes in coach Steve Kerr's rotations. He no longer glares at the coach for taking him out of games.
""He has been so much fun to coach,"" Kerr said. ""And I wouldn't have said that before he came back when he was rehabbing, he was not that much fun to coach. He would agree with that, he was so frustrated from the injury and from not being able to play and the length of his rehab. Since he returned and since he's grown comfortable with the injury, with the comeback and since his confidence has grown, he's been amazing to coach.
""He's a fantastic human being, a great teammate. You see his frustration and his passion on the court so people automatically sort of attach labels to him. What I see is passion and emotion because he wants to win.""
Teammate Shaun Livingston can only imagine what Cousins' first playoffs will mean after a nine-year wait, and after all the hours of rehab. Livingston has lived through the grueling recovery from a major injury like Cousins just endured.
""We're all going to be excited for him, and he's going to be excited,"" Livingston said. ""I expect him to have a great playoffs because he shows up big in big games.""
Livingston's left leg could have been amputated 12 years ago, and the knee injury he suffered while with the Clippers in 2007 was so serious nobody knew if he'd walk again let alone play basketball. Going for a layup, Livingston's leg buckled backward, parallel to the court, when he fell in a freak accident.
So, he can certainly relate to Cousins' comeback challenges. Livingston offered an encouraging word whenever Cousins seemed to need that boost or encouragement.
""It's pretty gratifying to see that. ... It feels good to see somebody that, you go through the struggle and then you're able to come back and have success at this level,"" Livingston said. ""Put in a lot of work, more importantly what is fulfilling to see is to see the hard work pay off, because I remember the hard work he's put in, getting to the gym early, getting his routine in. He's put in a lot of work into his body so he could come out and play and perform on the court.""
Cousins has taken his offensive game to another level, finding a rhythm in Golden State's offense and finding the open teammate with solid ball movement. Before his return, Cousins insisted he understood how things might be in a starting lineup of All-Stars: ""It's obvious I won't be taking as many shots as I have in the past,"" he said.
He is dangerous from anywhere, shooting the 3, moving well and drawing defenders to him. One of the NBA's most dominant big men when healthy, he is taking charges on the defensive end and altering shots.
""I never doubt DeMarcus. He's another guy that's got great pride, great competitor,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""He's always just wanted to be a part of a winning team and a winning organization. Now he has that here. He's a guy that he often gets overlooked because of the amount of talent and depth this team.
""You worry about this team at the 3-point line, well DeMarcus is a guy that in the playoffs you can go to and pound the ball inside into the post, he's going to score, get fouled, or create a double-team and find an open teammate. What a great luxury to have.""

Pascal Siakam confidently launches shots he may not have dared attempt in previous seasons. He makes plays during times of the game when he would have been sitting on the bench.
The Toronto Raptors forward might be the leading candidate for the most improved player award and he'd like to win it. But he's already received recognition that means more to him.
Fellow players have noticed how much work he's put in and how much it has paid off this season. The acknowledgement from All-Stars such as Paul George and Bradley Beal shows that Siakam's giant leap has caught the attention of more than just the media panel that votes for the NBA awards.
""I just enjoy sometimes after the games, guys coming up to me and showing respect for me. That's the most important thing,"" Siakam said. ""Like, I don't care about the rest. I think when your peers respect your game and respect the fact that they've seen you work, I think that's more important.""
There's a lot for them to have noticed, including:
— Siakam's scoring. It is up from 6.0 points per game through his first two seasons to 17.0 this season.
— His 3-point shooting. That's jumped from 21.6 percent to 36.8 percent.
A player who was feared almost entirely for his work around the basket now has to be accounted for even when he's away from it. Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson called Siakam an X-factor who now demands a much bigger part of the scouting report.
""It changes because he's shooting the ball better,"" Atkinson said. ""I think at first you could ignore his shot. Now it's like you've got to respect him from 3 and I know he's worked on it extremely hard, so that changes it.
""You could be in the paint, wait for his drives. You still have to respect (that) but I think he keeps getting better and better.""
D'Angelo Russell, Atkinson's All-Star point guard, might be the other top candidate for most improved player after leading the Nets to a surprising playoff berth. Sacramento's De'Aaron Fox and Buddy Hield, Denver's Malik Beasley and the Clippers' Montrezl Harrell are some other players worthy of consideration.
But of them, Siakam has the biggest role on the team with the best chance to be playing into June.
The Raptors made major changes after they were swept out of the postseason by LeBron James and Cleveland in consecutive years. Dwane Casey was fired even after winning coach of the year honors, and All-Star DeMar DeRozan was dealt to San Antonio in the trade to bring in Kawhi Leonard.
The Raptors have come back with 57 wins and the second-best record in the East, with Siakam's growth central to their success. He can play in a traditional big lineup alongside Leonard and center Marc Gasol, or in a smaller one if they go with Serge Ibaka in the middle.
The athleticism was always there for the 6-foot-9 forward. But now it's only part of the package for a player who made one 3-pointer his entire rookie season in 2016-17 and now averages one per game, the easiest place to notice his improvement.
""I don't know who else is even really up for it, who the voting's between, all that stuff. I know that if anybody's done more than this kid, has improved more, has impacted the team more and continued to improve from even geez, 20 games ago,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. ""He just keeps taking another step forward, there has been no steps back.
""He's certainly deserving. If there's somebody else who is deserving, then sometimes that's the way it works. But he's had an unbelievable season.""
Soon it will be time for the Raptors to show how much they've improved along with him. They became postseason punching bags the last couple years who want to show they won't be pushed around any longer.
""We have a new group so it's going to be definitely tough and I think we're more focused on that,"" Siakam said. ""Obviously we think about the playoffs, we're excited about it, can't wait for it. We just want to make sure we get the right chemistry and everything going so when that time comes, we'll be ready to perform.""
He got into only two playoff games two years ago, when the native of Cameroon was still learning the game. It was only five years earlier when he had come through the Basketball Without Borders camp in Africa, then headed to Texas for prep school and onto New Mexico State before becoming a late first-round pick.
He's not sure if friends back home are aware of his success. But if he wins the Most Improved Player award, chances are they'll hear about it.
""I'm definitely not a personal-type guy where I care about personal accolades and stuff, but definitely a team-guy first,"" Siakam said. ""Something like that, in terms of who I am and the person that I've become, and people that know my story and how I came up, that would mean a lot just because that's me. Like, that's literally who I am as a player and as a person.""

LONDON — The group entrusted with conducting the surprisingly difficult search for a candidate to run English soccer’s Premier League has received another rejection from an executive for whom the opportunity would appear to have been a step up.
Earlier this year, the league approached Christian Seifert, chief executive of Germany’s Bundesliga, to see if he would like to step into the shoes of Richard Scudamore, the towering figure under whose leadership England’s top flight managed to become by far the world’s most popular soccer league, not to mention its richest.
Seifert briefly thought about the idea before dismissing it, according to people with knowledge of his thinking. He is focused on managing the next set of broadcast rights sales as Germany’s league competes with Spain’s La Liga in the battle for second place behind the Premier League, said the people, who were not authorized to speak about it publicly.
A spokeswoman for the Bundesliga and Seifert declined to comment. A Premier League spokesman said the league did not comment on names linked to the role.
The search for Scudamore’s replacement has shined a harsh light on the search team, led by Chelsea’s chairman, Bruce Buck, entrusted to find the former advertising executive’s replacement. Last year, the group announced the appointment of Susanna Dinnage, a senior executive at Discovery Communications, before she abruptly changed her mind in late December. That left the league scrambling for a second option. A raft of names have since been linked to the post, but the search continues without any sign of an imminent appointment.
At a league board meeting, which was attended by a mix of owners and executives from the Premier League’s 20 teams, those in attendance were told that the search group, which has hired the U.K. headhunting firm Spencer Stuart to help with the process, has interviewed a final group of six candidates who will be shortlisted to three by the end of the month.
Scudamore’s replacement will find an increasingly busy inbox, as well as a challenging media climate, as the league attempts to at least keep pace with the multibillion-dollar deals that have fueled its rise. The Premier League recently joined counterparts across Europe in voicing concerns about plans by some of the continent’s top clubs to restructure the elite Champions League, changes that risk diminishing the value and relevance of domestic soccer.
The new boss must also manage tension between the league’s biggest clubs — a group of six that includes Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool, who have owners from the United States and who are constantly fighting for a larger slice of income at the expense of the rest of the competition. He or she will also be faced with as yet unknown challenges created by the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union.
But even without a leader, the Premier League continues to provide a compelling product for its worldwide fan base, with this season’s title race set to go to the wire as Manchester City and Liverpool match each other point for point into the final games, while the next four teams are involved in an equally tight fight for the final two qualification places for next season’s Champions League.
The delay, though, has been frustrating for some of the league’s staff and companies that do business with it. They had grown used to Scudamore’s decisive management style. For instance, the Premier League recently scrapped a multimillion-dollar agreement with Facebook to broadcast games in four Asian countries after failing to finalize the agreement. An executive involved in the talks, who had completed contracts with Scudamore in the past, said the leadership void did not help the process.

In the final home game of a legendary career, Dirk Nowitzki gave an exuberant sellout crowd one final show with a season-high 30 points in the Dallas Mavericks' 120-109 win against the visiting Phoenix Suns on Tuesday.
Nowitzki, 40, announced after the game that he would retire following the Mavericks' season finale Wednesday at San Antonio.
The 7-footer, who entered the league in the lockout-shortened 1999 season and revolutionized the power forward position, scored 10 points in the opening seven minutes and had 19 points on a season-high 18 shot attempts in the first half to power Dallas to a 68-38 halftime lead.
Suns veteran Jamal Crawford wasn't going to let Nowitzki totally steal the stage. He put in seven 3-pointers in posting a season-high 51 points. At age 39, he became the oldest player ever to reach 50 in an NBA game.
Heat 122, 76ers 99
Dwyane Wade, playing the final home game of his NBA career, scored 30 points to lead Miami over Philadelphia.
Wade made 10 of 23 shots, including 4 of 10 on attempts from beyond the arc. It was his second-highest scoring game of the season. But it was a bittersweet night for the Heat, who were eliminated from playoff contention earlier in the evening when the Detroit Pistons rallied from a 22-point deficit to defeat the Memphis Grizzlies.
Philadelphia, which has already clinched the third seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs, rested two of its stars: Joel Embiid, who was listed as having a knee injury, and JJ Redick (back).
Warriors 112, Pelicans 103
DeMarcus Cousins had 21 points and 12 rebounds against his former team as visiting Golden State defeated New Orleans.
After clinching home-court advantage throughout the Western Conference playoffs on Sunday, the Warriors had Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala and Andrew Bogut among their inactive players. Stephen Curry left for game after scoring five points in nine minutes in what the Warriors called ""a precaution"" after he sustained a mild foot sprain.
Jahlil Okafor scored 30 points to lead the short-handed Pelicans, who dressed just eight players and finished the season 33-49.
Raptors 120, Timberwolves 100
Kawhi Leonard scored 20 points as visiting Toronto completed its regular-season schedule with a victory over Minnesota.
The Raptors (58-24) secured the second-best record in the Eastern Conference with the win, behind only the Milwaukee Bucks (60-21), who play their final game Wednesday.
Fred VanVleet added 16 points for the Raptors, Chris Boucher added career bests with 15 points and 13 rebounds, and Pascal Siakam and Norman Powell each scored 10 points. Gorgui Dieng and Andrew Wiggins each scored 16 points for the Timberwolves.
Jazz 118, Nuggets 108
Donovan Mitchell matched his career best of 46 points, and Utah posted a victory over Denver in Salt Lake City.
Rudy Gobert added 20 points and 10 rebounds as Utah notched its ninth straight home win against Denver. Utah locked up the No. 5 seed for the Western Conference playoffs.
Malik Beasley scored 25 points on 9-of-13 shooting for the Nuggets, who have lost four of their past six games and are a half-game ahead of Houston after the Rockets fell to the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday.
Trail Blazers 104, Lakers 101
Instead of quietly sneaking into the offseason after losing its season finale to playoff-bound Portland, Los Angeles made some noise when Magic Johnson announced his resignation as president of basketball operations for the team.
The game still meant something for Portland, though, and the Trail Blazers clinched home-court advantage in the first round of the Western Conference playoffs when Maurice Harkless made a 3-pointer at the buzzer for a win. The Trail Blazers can overtake the Rockets on a tiebreaker to finish third in the West with a win against the visiting Sacramento Kings on Wednesday.
Harkless, who left the previous game with left hip tightness, finished with 26 points. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope had 32 points and eight assists for the Lakers, who finished with 37 wins -- two more than last season.
Thunder 112, Rockets 111
Russell Westbrook scored 29 points, but it was Paul George's corner 3-pointer with 1.8 seconds left that sent Oklahoma City to a home win over Houston.
Oklahoma City trailed by 14 early in the fourth quarter and by four in the final minute before Westbrook's and George's heroics.
James Harden made his first 12 free throws in the game but with less than 10 seconds left and Houston on top 111-109, he missed one, giving the Thunder a chance to tie or take the lead. Westbrook barreled up the court, briefly handing the ball off to Steven Adams near midcourt before getting the ball and firing it to George in the corner for what proved to be the game-winner.
Celtics 116, Wizards 100
Terry Rozier led seven Boston players in double figures with 21 points as his team closed out the regular season with a win over host Washington.
The Celtics rallied from a 13-point, third-quarter deficit for their sixth win in eight games. Boston, which played without Marcus Smart, Jayson Tatum, Kyrie Irving, Al Horford, Marcus Morris, Aron Baynes and Gordon Hayward, will be the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs.
Semi Ojeleye, Brad Wanamaker and RJ Hunter had 17 points apiece for Boston, which outscored Washington 27-15 in the fourth quarter. Tomas Satoransky led the Wizards with 19 points, and Bradley Beal scored 16 points in 16 minutes. Beal became the first person in franchise history to finish a season averaging at least 25 points, five rebounds and five assists per game.
Pistons 100, Grizzlies 93
Andre Drummond scored 20 points and grabbed 17 rebounds, and Detroit came back from a 22-point deficit to defeat visiting Memphis.
Despite winning, the Pistons were unable to clinch the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. The Charlotte Hornets beat the Cleveland Cavaliers and remain one game behind Detroit heading into Wednesday night's final regular-season games. The Pistons finish against the Knicks at New York while the Hornets host the Orlando Magic.
The Pistons, who trailed by 22 in the second quarter, climbed all the way back and took an 85-83 lead on Ish Smith's jumper just moments after his 3-pointer tied the score at 83-all. Smith finished with 22 points off the bench, and Luke Kennard added 15 for Detroit.
Hornets 124, Cavaliers 97
Kemba Walker and Jeremy Lamb scored 23 points apiece, and Charlotte kept its playoff hopes alive with a victory over host Cleveland.
The Hornets led by 12 points in the first half and then pushed the lead all the way to 27 in the fourth quarter, winning their fourth straight and eighth in their past 11 games. They hit a season-high 22 3-pointers on 44 attempts and shot 57.7 percent from the field.
Miles Bridges and Dwayne Bacon added 18 points apiece for the Hornets. Frank Kaminsky scored 14 and Devonte Graham had 10. Collin Sexton led the Cavs with 18 points.
Knicks 96, Bulls 86
Dennis Smith Jr. scored 25 points and Kevin Knox and Luke Kornet each notched double-doubles to lead New York past host Chicago.
Knox had 17 points and 10 rebounds, Kornet chipped in 12 points and 13 rebounds and Damyean Dotson added 12 points for the Knicks (17-64), who are already assured of the NBA's worst record this season. They can do no worse than tie the franchise record for fewest wins in a regular season, set in 2014-15.
The Bulls closed the home portion of their schedule with a 9-32 record, setting a franchise record for home futility. The 2000-01 team held the previous club standard for fewest home victories with 10.

PARIS — French TV group TF1 will exclusively broadcast the 2019 Rugby World Cup in France, it said on Wednesday, lifting the shares of the country's major TV broadcaster.
""After the success of previous editions, notably during the 2011 final between France and the All Blacks with 17.8 million viewers and 87 percent of audience share, TF1 Group will offer the French audience all 48 matches of the 2019 Rugby World Cup,"" TF1 said in a statement.
TF1 shares were up 4.1 percent at 0750 GMT, and were the best performers on Paris' SBF-120 index, as analysts and fund managers welcomed the contract win.
""Given the sluggishness of the overall advertising market, any bit of good news regarding TV advertising is going to be well received by the market. In that context, winning exclusive rights for the Rugby World Cup - even if it's not as big as the soccer World Cup - is a good bit of news for TF1,"" said Gregoire Laverne, fund manager at Roche Brune Asset Management.
France will go into this year's Rugby World Cup in Japan, which takes place from September through to November, on the back of a poor Six Nations tournament.
Jacques Brunel, the coach of ""Les Bleus"", believes his team can iron out their problems before the World Cup but another disappointing Six Nations campaign suggested it would be an achievement for them to reach the knockout rounds in Japan.
France beat Scotland and Italy in the Six Nations but were thrashed by England and Ireland, and their second-half collapse against Wales showed their mental fragility.

AUGUSTA, Ga. — The winds of change continued to blow through Augusta National on Wednesday but chairman Fred Ridley made it clear that some things will never alter at the home of the Masters.
While tradition remains the bedrock of one of the world's most exclusive clubs, Augusta National is willing to embrace new ideas when it suits as it did last week when hosting a first women's tournament.
More changes, big and small, in both attitude and design are on the horizon.
Much of the talk coming into the year's first major has centered on tweaks to the fifth hole, which has been stretched 40 yards with the potential to be the most difficult on the iconic layout.
While the course has undergone almost continuous renovations, some holes will never change, such as Amen Corner which Ridley declared a ""sacred place"".
Outside the Augusta National walls, however, there are no such concerns.
The club has spent hundreds of millions of dollars gobbling up land for a new mega-project -- building a digital broadcast compound that will require the construction of a tunnel under Washington Road -- that Ridley described as the first of its kind in the State of Georgia.
""As we state every year, we're bound to a tradition of constant improvement,"" said Ridley during the chairman's annual address. ""We maintain (former club and tournament chairman) Mr. Roberts' philosophy that nothing stands still.""
In contrast to Ridley's forward thinking, time has often appeared to stand still at Augusta National, which did not welcome its first woman member until seven years ago.
Founded by Bobby Jones and Clifford Roberts and opened for play in January 1933, there were no mobile phones then and none are allowed on the property now.
Billy Payne, the previous Augusta chairman, said smartphones would never be welcome on the course as long as he was in charge and Ridley, who took over as the top man in 2017, sees no reason to change that policy.
The zero-tolerance mobile phone policy is one that Augusta National zealously monitors.
Anyone caught on the grounds with a cell phone is removed and there have been reports of offenders having their badge privileges revoked for life.
""I think our patrons appreciate our cell phone policy,"" said Ridley. ""I know that we have now become an outlier, if not the only outlier in golf, as well, at allowing cell phones.
""I don't believe that's a policy that anyone should expect is going to change in the near future, if ever.
""I can't speak for future chairmen, but speaking for myself, I think we got that right.""
Manners and golf etiquette, which have slowly disappeared from many other tournaments, will also never go out of style at Augusta National, Ridley said.
No running, no pictures, no laying down on the grass and certainly no boorish or ill-timed comments are tolerated.
""We encourage our patrons to exhibit proper decorum,"" said Ridley. ""It's right on the pairing sheet.
""There's a great quote from Bobby Jones about that, and the importance of good behavior and how distressing it is for someone to applaud a bad shot, which you do hear from time to time at other places.
""There's something about Augusta National when someone walks through the gates, they know that it's a place of respect, of beauty, and honoring traditions and values of the game.""

As expected, Duke freshman star R.J. Barrett officially declared for the 2019 NBA Draft on Wednesday.
""I want to thank God, my family, my coaches and everyone that has helped me reach this decision,"" the 6-foot-7 forward posted on Twitter.
Barrett is projected as a top-three pick in the June 20 draft, along with Blue Devils teammate and fellow first-team All-American Zion Williamson.
Barrett averaged 22.6 points, 7.6 rebounds and 4.3 assists and started all 38 games for Duke (32-6), which reached the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament.
--Kentucky freshman Keldon Johnson is entering the draft and hiring an agent, but he is leaving the door open to decide to return to school by the May 29 deadline.
""My hope is to be a lottery pick,"" he said in a statement. ""If I am, I plan on pursuing my dreams and staying in the draft, but I want to go through the process first and get the correct information.""
Johnson, a 6-6 guard, was third on the Wildcats in scoring (13.5 points per game) and rebounding (5.9 per game), earning SEC Freshman of the Year of the honors.
--Arizona State guard Luguentz Dort, the Pac-12 Freshman of the Year, told ESPN he is ""all-in"" for the NBA draft.
Dort, a burly 6-4 guard, averaged 16.1 points, 4.3 rebounds and 2.3 assists for the Sun Devils. He earned second-team All-Pac-12 honors and was on the league's all-defensive team.
He is ranked No. 27 among ESPN's list of top draft prospects.
--Ohio State sophomore forward Kaleb Wesson will go through the draft process, coach Chris Holtmann said.
""That process began about a week ago and we'll see where it leads,"" Holtmann said on Cleveland.com. ""We've begun to gather some information from advisory committee for guys going through this process and that's been helpful.""
Wesson averaged team highs with 14.6 points and 6.9 rebounds on the 2018-19 season.

Count Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James among those who were stunned by team president Magic Johnson's resignation on Tuesday night.
Despite Johnson's sudden departure, James stands behind the organization and Lakers owner Jeanie Buss, a source close to the All-Star forward told ESPN's Ramona Shelburne.
ESPN also reported that head coach Luke Walton participated in exit meetings with the players on Wednesday.
Walton's job security is in jeopardy after the Lakers (37-45) missed the playoffs for the sixth consecutive season despite the offseason signing of James to a four-year, $154 million deal.
James, 34, battled injuries and appeared in a career-low 55 games and averaged 27.4 points, 8.5 rebounds and 8.3 assists per game in 2018-19.

Anthony Davis acknowledged Wednesday that despite his desire to leave New Orleans, he could begin the 2019-20 season with the Pelicans.
""I'm under contract still,"" Davis said during an informal end-of-year news conference. ""I have a year left. Obviously it's a possibility it could happen. I don't have ill will toward anybody. I know that it's a possibility that next year I could be here as well. So I can't be mad if I'm here next year.""
Davis said his next step will be to see who emerges as the general manager for the Pelicans. Dell Demps was fired in February after his handling of the Davis situation, and Danny Ferry has been the interim general manager.
""Seeing what happens,"" Davis said. ""Seeing who the Pelicans make their GM and having a conversation with that person about the future. My time here has always been great. I love playing here. It's something that I will definitely hold in my heart forever, but the next step is waiting on the Pelicans [to fill] that GM job.""
But Davis didn't say that means he will rescind his trade request or re-sign with the Pelicans, nor is he sorry for the way things played out this season. He becomes a free agent in July 2020, and the Pelicans can offer him the most money with a supermax contract.
Davis' agent announced in January that Davis wanted a trade and would not re-sign in New Orleans. His agent, Rich Paul, also represents LeBron James, and many viewed Davis and Paul as forcing a trade to the Lakers. He didn't say whether team president Magic Johnson's abrupt resignation on Tuesday would have any effect on potentially playing in Los Angeles.
""I have no idea what's going on over there,"" Davis said. ""What's going on with the Lakers -- I got a lot of other stuff to worry about.""
Davis, 26, was an All-Star in six of his seven seasons with New Orleans. In 56 games this year, the center averaged 25.9 points, 12.0 rebounds and 3.9 assists.

MILWAUKEE — Christian Yelich homered and drove in three, Josh Hader completed an eight-out save and the Milwaukee Brewers beat the Chicago Cubs 4-2 Sunday.
Zach Davies (1-0) pitched effectively into the sixth, helping Milwaukee win for the seventh time in eight games, including two of three against Chicago. The Brewers have won 15 of their last 16 regular season series dating to last year.
The Cubs lost for the seventh time in eight games, dropping to 2-7.
Willson Contreras' two-run homer in the sixth against Davies was unearned, and that was all Chicago could muster at the plate. Davies pitched 5 2/3 innings of five-hit ball, and Alex Claudio got two outs before handing off to Hader.
Hader struck out three over 2 2/3 perfect innings, throwing 36 pitches for his fifth save. The All-Star left-hander hadn't pitched since Tuesday against Cincinnati.
Yelich struck a two-run homer in the first inning off Kyle Hendricks (0-2), his fifth of the season and 100th of his career.
Travis Shaw's run-scoring single in the third made it 3-0. Milwaukee loaded the bases with no outs in the fourth but managed just one run on Yelich's sacrifice fly.
Hendricks surrendered four runs and eight hits in four innings. He walked one and struck out four over 75 pitches.
After giving up a single to Ben Zobrist to lead off the game, Davies (1-0) retired nine in row before Kris Bryant's one-out bloop single in the fourth.
Davies cruised until the sixth, when Anthony Rizzo reached on first baseman Eric Thames' error and Javier Baez had an infield hit. Milwaukee nearly escaped with a groundball double play, but Contreras hit a two-run homer to chase Davies.
The Cubs threatened again the seventh, putting runners on the corners with one out before Hader came on to record the final two outs, including a strikeout of Rizzo.
ROSTER MOVE
The Brewers recalled RHP Jake Petricka from Triple-A San Antonio. RHP Taylor Williams was optioned to San Antonio.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Brewers: 1B Jesus Aguilar, LF Ryan Braun and C Yasmani Grandal, all regular starters, got the day off.
UP NEXT
Cubs: After a nine-game road trip to start the season, Chicago will open at home Monday against Pittsburgh. Jon Lester (1-0, 3.00 ERA) will make his third start of the season. He's 9-6 with a 3.18 ERA in 18 career starts against the Pirates.
Brewers: Jhoulys Chacin (2-0, 4.22) will take the mound in the opener of a three-game series in Los Angeles against the Angels.

In the final home game of a legendary career, Dirk Nowitzki gave an exuberant sellout crowd one final show with a season-high 30 points in the Dallas Mavericks' 120-109 win against the visiting Phoenix Suns on Tuesday.
Nowitzki, 40, announced after the game that he would retire following the Mavericks' season finale Wednesday at San Antonio.
The 7-footer, who entered the league in the lockout-shortened 1999 season and revolutionized the power forward position, scored 10 points in the opening seven minutes and had 19 points on a season-high 18 shot attempts in the first half to power Dallas to a 68-38 halftime lead.
He secured his season high in points with a straightaway 3-pointer, his fifth of the game, early in the third quarter for 22 points. That was followed by a rare slam dunk that elicited howls from the crowd and a big smile across Nowitzki's face.
The 14-time All-Star and sixth-leading scorer in NBA history then drained another jumper for 26 points and an 80-49 Dallas lead. He re-entered the game with three minutes left and hit two more buckets to go 11 of 31 from the floor. He finished with eight rebounds, three assists and a block in a season-high 32 minutes.
Suns veteran Jamal Crawford wasn't going to let Nowitzki totally steal the stage. He put in seven 3-pointers in posting a season-high 51 points -- one off his career best -- with 26 coming in the fourth quarter, to get the Suns as close as 105-100 with 4:20 to play.
Crawford, 39, became the oldest player ever to score 50-plus points in an NBA game. The old mark was held by Michael Jordan, who was 38 when he scored 51 for the Washington Wizards on Dec. 29, 2001, against the Charlotte Hornets.
According to ESPN, Crawford also became the first player to score 50 points for four different franchises (Chicago Bulls, New York Knicks, Golden State Warriors and now Phoenix).
The Suns closed out a miserable season, finishing 19-63.
A longer-than-expected recovery from ankle surgery kept Nowitzki out until mid-December. From there, he mostly came off the bench for the first time in his career, and averaged 6.6 points in less than 15 minutes a game before Tuesday.
But on this special night, Nowitzki turned back the clock, and so did the crowd as it chanted ""M-V-P! M-V-P!"" Nowitzki won the league's regular-season MVP award in 2006-07 and earned NBA Finals MVP in 2011, when he delivered Dallas its lone championship.
The future of the Mavs (33-48), rookie Luka Doncic, also didn't disappoint, notching his eighth triple-double with 21 points, 11 assists and 16 rebounds. He moved into sole possession of third place for most triple-doubles by a rookie.

SHANGHAI — The first Formula One win is special for every driver but Charles Leclerc will feel it magnified by a thousand if he triumphs in China this weekend after being denied by cruel misfortune in Bahrain.
Sunday's race is the 1,000th in world championship history and the Ferrari driver, who took pole position and set the fastest race lap at Sakhir two weeks ago, can write his name on it with a first victory.
""I hope the car will be as good as it was in Bahrain, so that I can continue to go for the results we deserve,"" said the 21-year-old Monegasque.
The same engine that Leclerc used in Bahrain will again be available after Ferrari engineers found a short-circuit in the car's injection system control unit had robbed him of victory.
Five times world champion Lewis Hamilton, winner in Bahrain after Leclerc slowed while leading, has been more successful than anyone in China and will be aiming to win the race for a sixth time.
Champions Mercedes have won the first two races of the season one-two but against the odds, with Ferrari looking ominously quick in Bahrain until Leclerc's loss of power.
Despite Mercedes taking five Chinese wins from the last seven races, they have a fight on their hands and they know it.
""We are happy but we are also conscious and aware of how lucky we were today to come away with a one-two,"" Hamilton said after the race in Bahrain.
""We all worked so hard through the weekend as we do every weekend but we underperformed.""
Team mate Valtteri Bottas, who leads Hamilton by one point in the standings after winning the opener in Australia, should also be a contender.
The Finn was on course for victory in Shanghai last year until a virtual safety car handed it to then-Red Bull driver Daniel Ricciardo, who has yet to score a point this season for Renault, instead.
Ferrari, however, are expected to have the edge down the Shanghai circuit's main straight, which is over a kilometer long.
""If they are able to maintain those power levels...on a power sensitive circuit like Shanghai, they are the favorites, clearly,"" said Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff. ""The lap time benefit might even be more than in Bahrain.""
Red is seen as a lucky color in China and Leclerc, who hung on for third in Bahrain and a first podium finish, could do with a slice of good fortune after the disappointment in the desert.
Four-time champion team mate Sebastian Vettel, who spun and was outpaced by Leclerc two weeks ago, will also be fired up to re-establish his number one status and close the points gap to Mercedes.
The German has won just once in China, when he handed Red Bull their maiden victory in 2009, before the current V6 turbo hybrid era.
Red Bull will be on the lookout for any opportunity to repeat last year's success on the 10th anniversary of that first win.
""Overall, Shanghai provides you with a lot of opportunities to fight and set up overtakes,"" said Max Verstappen, who botched his chances of victory and a possible one-two last year with scrappy attempts to overtake Hamilton and Vettel.
""I'm looking forward to hopefully having an exciting race there.""

France will go into this year's Rugby World Cup in Japan, which takes place from September through to November, on the back of a poor Six Nations tournament.
Jacques Brunel, the coach of ""Les Bleus"", believes his team can iron out their problems before the World Cup but another disappointing Six Nations campaign suggested it would be an achievement for them to reach the knockout rounds in Japan.
France beat Scotland and Italy in the Six Nations but were thrashed by England and Ireland, and their second-half collapse against Wales showed their mental fragility.

AUGUSTA Ga. (Reuters) - Bryson DeChambeau has earned the ""mad scientist"" nickname for his calculated approach to golf and may need to spend some extra time in his quirky laboratory to find a winning formula at this week's Masters.
DeChambeau, a physics major who previously used a since-banned compass to help read greens, has five wins on the PGA Tour but taming Augusta National will prove the toughest test yet for the American world number six.
The year's first major does not provide players with green-reading books, and that could put DeChambeau well out of his comfort zone given the highly-contoured greens at Augusta National that can frustrate the game's best putters.
""I have to work a little harder to get some insight into some things than other places, but that's fine,"" DeChambeau told reporters on Monday.
""I mean, that's a part of the process, and I think the person who digs it out of the dirt the most should have a little bit of an advantage and I think that's where it's actually a positive thing.""
DeChambeau, who finished as the low amateur at the Masters in 2016 before joining the PGA Tour the following year, already has a win this season but knows he faces a difficult challenge going into Thursday's opening round.
Unlike many of his competitors, DeChambeau will not be able to rely on the detailed notes they have modified over the years after logging countless practice and tournament rounds at Augusta National.
DeChambeau made no secrets when asked about what impact the lack of green-reading books could have on him this week.
""Now I practiced trying to understand what one percent is, what two percent is, based on my eyes,"" said DeChambeau. ""Is it as precise as the greens books? Absolutely not. We still have to feel and sense with our eyes what it's going to do.
""That's really all I can do and I have to practice a lot more hitting breaking putts, because I can't just bring out my compass and go, oh, it's 3 percent and here it is. I have to look at and walk around and go, okay, I'm acclimated to 3 percent.""

LUGANO, Switzerland — The season-long streak of having different winners at each WTA tour event will continue for another week after Alison Van Uytvanck lost in the second round of the Samsung Open on Wednesday.
Van Uytvanck is among the 16 women who have won a singles title in 2019. She was the last of the group still playing at this week's clay-court tournaments in Lugano, Switzerland and Bogota, Colombia.
The fourth-seeded Belgian lost 6-4, 7-5 to 108th-ranked Fiona Ferro of France to ensure there will not be a repeat of her hard-court victory in Budapest in February.
Polona Hercog joined Ferro in the quarterfinals by beating another unseeded player, Sorana Cirstea, 3-6, 7-6, 6-4.
The 89th-ranked Hercog had also dropped the first set in her first-round win over second-seeded Carla Suarez Navarro.

In the final home game of a legendary career, Dirk Nowitzki gave an exuberant sellout crowd one final show with a season-high 30 points in the Dallas Mavericks' 120-109 win against the visiting Phoenix Suns on Tuesday.
Nowitzki, 40, announced after the game that he would retire following the Mavericks' season finale Wednesday at San Antonio.
The 7-footer, who entered the league in the lockout-shortened 1999 season and revolutionized the power forward position, scored 10 points in the opening seven minutes and had 19 points on a season-high 18 shot attempts in the first half to power Dallas to a 68-38 halftime lead.
He secured his season high in points with a straightaway 3-pointer, his fifth of the game, early in the third quarter for 22 points. That was followed by a rare slam dunk that elicited howls from the crowd and a big smile across Nowitzki's face.
The 14-time All-Star and sixth-leading scorer in NBA history then drained another jumper for 26 points and an 80-49 Dallas lead. He re-entered the game with three minutes left and hit two more buckets to go 11 of 31 from the floor. He finished with eight rebounds, three assists and a block in a season-high 32 minutes.
Suns veteran Jamal Crawford wasn't going to let Nowitzki totally steal the stage. He put in seven 3-pointers in posting a season-high 51 points -- one off his career best -- with 26 coming in the fourth quarter, to get the Suns as close as 105-100 with 4:20 to play.
Crawford, 39, became the oldest player ever to score 50-plus points in an NBA game. The old mark was held by Michael Jordan, who was 38 when he scored 51 for the Washington Wizards on Dec. 29, 2001, against the Charlotte Hornets.
According to ESPN, Crawford also became the first player to score 50 points for four different franchises (Chicago Bulls, New York Knicks, Golden State Warriors and now Phoenix).
The Suns closed out a miserable season, finishing 19-63.
A longer-than-expected recovery from ankle surgery kept Nowitzki out until mid-December. From there, he mostly came off the bench for the first time in his career, and averaged 6.6 points in less than 15 minutes a game before Tuesday.
But on this special night, Nowitzki turned back the clock, and so did the crowd as it chanted ""M-V-P! M-V-P!"" Nowitzki won the league's regular-season MVP award in 2006-07 and earned NBA Finals MVP in 2011, when he delivered Dallas its lone championship.
The future of the Mavs (33-48), rookie Luka Doncic, also didn't disappoint, notching his eighth triple-double with 21 points, 11 assists and 16 rebounds. He moved into sole possession of third place for most triple-doubles by a rookie.

SHANGHAI — The first Formula One win is special for every driver but Charles Leclerc will feel it magnified by a thousand if he triumphs in China this weekend after being denied by cruel misfortune in Bahrain.
Sunday's race is the 1,000th in world championship history and the Ferrari driver, who took pole position and set the fastest race lap at Sakhir two weeks ago, can write his name on it with a first victory.
""I hope the car will be as good as it was in Bahrain, so that I can continue to go for the results we deserve,"" said the 21-year-old Monegasque.
The same engine that Leclerc used in Bahrain will again be available after Ferrari engineers found a short-circuit in the car's injection system control unit had robbed him of victory.
Five times world champion Lewis Hamilton, winner in Bahrain after Leclerc slowed while leading, has been more successful than anyone in China and will be aiming to win the race for a sixth time.
Champions Mercedes have won the first two races of the season one-two but against the odds, with Ferrari looking ominously quick in Bahrain until Leclerc's loss of power.
Despite Mercedes taking five Chinese wins from the last seven races, they have a fight on their hands and they know it.
""We are happy but we are also conscious and aware of how lucky we were today to come away with a one-two,"" Hamilton said after the race in Bahrain.
""We all worked so hard through the weekend as we do every weekend but we underperformed.""
Team mate Valtteri Bottas, who leads Hamilton by one point in the standings after winning the opener in Australia, should also be a contender.
The Finn was on course for victory in Shanghai last year until a virtual safety car handed it to then-Red Bull driver Daniel Ricciardo, who has yet to score a point this season for Renault, instead.
Ferrari, however, are expected to have the edge down the Shanghai circuit's main straight, which is over a kilometer long.
""If they are able to maintain those power levels...on a power sensitive circuit like Shanghai, they are the favorites, clearly,"" said Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff. ""The lap time benefit might even be more than in Bahrain.""
Red is seen as a lucky color in China and Leclerc, who hung on for third in Bahrain and a first podium finish, could do with a slice of good fortune after the disappointment in the desert.
Four-time champion team mate Sebastian Vettel, who spun and was outpaced by Leclerc two weeks ago, will also be fired up to re-establish his number one status and close the points gap to Mercedes.
The German has won just once in China, when he handed Red Bull their maiden victory in 2009, before the current V6 turbo hybrid era.
Red Bull will be on the lookout for any opportunity to repeat last year's success on the 10th anniversary of that first win.
""Overall, Shanghai provides you with a lot of opportunities to fight and set up overtakes,"" said Max Verstappen, who botched his chances of victory and a possible one-two last year with scrappy attempts to overtake Hamilton and Vettel.
""I'm looking forward to hopefully having an exciting race there.""

On Sunday, April 15, 1979, Ed Sneed was about to win the Masters. He was leading by three shots with three holes to go. Then, suddenly, the game became as cruel as it can possibly be.
Sneed, who had started the day
ahead by five
, bogeyed 16, 17 and 18 — his par putt on 18 hung on the lip — then lost on the second hole of a sudden-death
playoff to Fuzzy Zoeller
. Sneed, who is now 74 and finished his career with four tour victories, never came close again to winning a major. He left in 1985 to go into the investment business.
In a recent interview, Sneed reflected on that time. The conversation has been edited and condensed.
How often does someone bring up 1979?
For the first five years, there would be articles in magazines the week or month before the Masters. Every year, since that Masters, there’s been at least one or two guys who have called me. This year, there seems to be more focus on it, and I’ve had quite a few calls because it’s the 40th anniversary.
How did losing that tournament affect your life?
I probably would have played the tour longer. I don’t think it made me basically a different person. I’ve often said, in my reaction, nobody died. I had a chance to win a big golf tournament, and I didn’t. It did have an impact, but at the same time, I never felt like it destroyed me in any way.
Watching the final round recently, it looked as if there were not any shots on the last three holes you’d want to take back except the approach on 18, which missed the green. Is that right?
That’s right. I always heard, “Well, you hit to the right at 16.” I didn’t hit to the right at 16. I hit a draw. Why the ball didn’t bounce to the left, I don’t know. At 17, [where his approach finished a few yards over the green] I discovered the next year I had the wrong yardage by three or four yards.
You thought the putt on 18 was in, didn’t you?
I thought the putt would just barely move to the right. So, I hit the ball at the left side of the cup. And when it was about two feet away, it looked like it had moved a little bit toward the hole. I thought it was going right in, and then it hung on the left. It looked like a quarter of the ball was hanging over the hole.
The next year, I was playing a practice round on Wednesday afternoon after the Par 3 tournament. I was by myself. I started at 10. At the 11th green, Hord Hardin, the [acting] tournament chairman, told me, “Ed, that was tough luck last year, but we feel that you waited about 12 seconds to tap it in, and under the rules you only had 10, and if it had fallen in, we would have been in a dilemma, and we probably would have had to penalize you a stroke.”
You realized pretty soon that how you’d respond to the loss would be a test.
I ended up going to the Tallahassee Open the next week, and one of the press guys sat down next to me, and this is something I’ve always held on to. When I got back to the house in Augusta that night, my girls at the time were 4½ years old and barely 2. My 4½-year-old had been watching television. When I walked in, she came running up to me and said, “Daddy, you won, you won.” I realized that it didn’t make any difference to them. I was still their dad.
When people ask me, “Do I think about it?” I sure do. Not as much now as I used to. I don’t dwell on it. I’ve never felt like, “Why me?” You look at things that go on around the world, and other people’s circumstances. What did I do? I missed a putt to win the Masters. If that’s the worst thing that happened to me, even in just golf, so be it.

In his two years as president of basketball operations for the Los Angeles Lakers, Magic Johnson presided over a team as chaotic and playoff-free as the one he’d inherited.
The Lakers succeeded in stockpiling talent — including the franchise-altering signing of LeBron James — but failed in putting together complementary pieces, or attracting the second major star Johnson openly said he was chasing.
[Magic Johnson stunned the basketball world by
suddenly stepping down on Tuesday
.]
Here’s a look back at Johnson’s high and low points while running the team.
In February 2017, four seasons into the team’s longest-ever playoff drought, the Lakers
reshuffled their front office
by firing the general manager, Mitch Kupchak, and installing Johnson as its president. Less than a month later, Rob Pelinka, a longtime agent, was hired as the general manager, reporting to Johnson.
Officially and unofficially, Johnson had remained tied to the team since he retired in 1996. He owned a share of the team from 1994 to 2010, and after that he was an honorary vice president — a title the team took away from him after he violated the league’s tampering rules by tweeting about free agents.
Three weeks before he was hired in his new role, he had returned to the Lakers as an adviser to Jeanie Buss, the team’s president and co-owner. She would soon clean house while promoting Johnson.
“Everyone associated with the Lakers will now be pulling in the same direction, the direction established by
Earvin
and myself,” she said, using Johnson’s given name. “We are determined to get back to competing to win N.B.A. championships again.”
The first major test of the new regime had decidedly mixed results.
Days before the draft, Johnson shed the costly contract of Timofey Mozgov by giving up on D’Angelo Russell, whom the team had selected second over all just two years earlier. In return for the duo, the Brooklyn Nets gave up Brook Lopez and the 27th pick in the draft, which turned into the promising Kyle Kuzma. But Russell
has blossomed this year with the Nets
, earning an All-Star appearance while leading Brooklyn back to the playoffs.
Russell’s departure opened the point guard spot for Lonzo Ball, who has flashed two-way potential but largely fallen short of his lofty expectations as the second pick in the draft. In addition to Kuzma, the Lakers struck gold with Josh Hart, who was selected 30th and has become a core piece.
Johnson made no secret of his intent to draw the game’s biggest stars to Los Angeles, with an eye toward what was expected to be a major 2018 off-season. The team largely punted on the 2017 off-season to preserve its salary cap space in 2018, signing Kentavious Caldwell-Pope to a one-year deal.
At the 2018 trade deadline, the Lakers shed the contracts of Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr., opening more cap space. Johnson said the trade indicated the Lakers would have the cap space and the ability to land two star players, either by trade or free agency.
“I wouldn’t have made the move if I wasn’t confident,” he said at the time.
Signing LeBron James to a long-term contract in 2018 was exactly the kind of result the Lakers had planned for and needed, setting expectations that they would return to the playoffs and compete for a championship. But the free agents the Lakers signed to surround him — Caldwell-Pope, Rajon Rondo, Lance Stephenson, JaVale McGee and Michael Beasley — immediately puzzled some observers.
An optimist would have called them playoff-tested veterans. Others saw it differently: A cast of nonshooters and big personalities who would have a questionable fit next to James and the Lakers’ young talent.
The hodgepodge crew was assembled partly because the team struck out on its bigger targets. After years of speculation that Paul George would return to his hometown, he instead opted to re-sign with Oklahoma City. The San Antonio Spurs sent Kawhi Leonard east to the Toronto Raptors. DeMarcus Cousins signed a bargain, one-year deal with the Golden State Warriors.
Once the season arrived, the Lakers
blew it in dramatic fashion
, extending their record playoff drought. But they preserved cap space for the 2019 off-season, giving them another chance to add a star.
There could be little doubt the Lakers would be interested in Anthony Davis as soon as he became available. James and Davis share an agent, and the Lakers were long believed to be Davis’s most committed suitor.
But when the All-Star center
made a public trade request in late January
, he created a debacle for Johnson and the Lakers. The players in the Lakers’ young core — Ball, Kuzma, Hart and Brandon Ingram, the second overall pick from the 2016 draft — were constantly named in leaked trade offers.
The Pelicans made an effort to head off any potential tampering when they announced Davis’s trade request. “We have also requested the League to strictly enforce the tampering rules associated with this transaction,” the team said in a statement.
In addition to Davis’s connections to the Lakers, Los Angeles had a well-known history of tampering, dating back to Johnson’s tweets before he took over.
Johnson was not very subtle about recruiting George during a 2017 appearance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” during which he was asked what he would do if he saw the player socially.
“We’re going to say hi because we know each other, you just can’t say, ‘Hey, I want you to come to the Lakers,’ even though I’ll be wink-winking like, ‘You know what that means, right?’ ”
The episode earned Johnson a warning from the N.B.A., and the team was later fined $500,000 for what the league deemed impermissible contact between Pelinka and George’s agent.
In June 2018, Johnson was
fined $50,000
for his comments about Giannis Antetokounmpo after praising the Bucks star.
In February, the Sixers’ Ben Simmons — who plays as an oversize point guard, like Johnson did — requested a meeting with Johnson to get playing tips, prompting Johnson to publicly praise the former Rookie of the Year. But the league ultimately determined Johnson had not broken tampering rules.

SUNRISE, Fla. — The Florida Panthers have hired Joel Quenneville as their coach.
The Panthers announced the move Monday morning and plan to introduce Quenneville later in the day. Quenneville is second on the NHL's all-time coaching wins list with 890 victories. He also won three Stanley Cups as coach of the Chicago Blackhawks.
The hiring also reunites him with Panthers general manager Dale Tallon, who brought Quenneville to Chicago.
Quenneville replaces Bob Boughner, who was fired Sunday after two seasons.
Quenneville becomes the 16th coach in Florida history, and will be asked to be the coach who ends the team's playoff drought. Florida has missed 16 of the last 18 postseasons and has not won a playoff series since 1996.

LAS VEGAS — The Vegas Golden Knights struggled when they opened the season and wound up in last place in the Western Conference at one point, a humbling stumble for a team that was just a few months removed from a charmed run to the Stanley Cup Final in its first year of existence.
With the addition of Mark Stone and four stacked lines, the defending conference champions may be hitting their stride at the right time as the playoffs arrive.
Vegas opens the postseason Wednesday in San Jose, a rematch of the second-round series won by the Golden Knights in six games last season.
Stone, a top-line talent who came to the team at the trade deadline, joined offseason acquisitions Paul Stastny and Max Pacioretty to form one of the most dangerous lines in the league. Vegas is 11-4-2 since acquiring Stone from Ottawa.
""You look at the entire group as a whole, we have depth, and a lot of teams have that,"" Stone said. ""We're just looking to build as deep of a team as possible, and I think we've done a good job of that.""
That includes what has been Vegas' top line the past two seasons: Jonathan Marchessault, William Karlsson and Reilly Smith — the team's top three points scorers, with 59, 56 and 53, respectively.
Stone leads everyone with 73 points, but 62 came with Ottawa, before he arrived in Las Vegas.
Coach Gerard Gallant doesn't see a difference in the lines consisting of his top six forwards, as he tends to alternate the two in the starting lineup.
""Truthfully, there's no second line for me,"" said Gallant, last year's Jack Adams Award winner. ""There's a lot of talent in both of those lines and when both of them are playing well, everything's going right, it's a tough team to beat.""
Then there's the bottom six, which on any given night has produced all the offense the Golden Knights need.
Alex Tuch ranks fourth on the team with 52 points, Cody Eakin is sixth with 41 points and the goal-scoring duo has given the Golden Knights depth at the third line, something they lacked last June when the Washington Capitals celebrated their first Stanley Cup title on Vegas' home ice.
The fourth line of Pierre-Edouard Bellemare, William Carrier and Ryan Reaves is the blue-collar line that can wreak havoc from a physical standpoint, or produce offense when the opposition least expects it.
Reaves leads the league with 305 hits, while Carrier ranks fourth with 277.
""We know what we can and can't do,"" Stone said. ""We need to be playing our style of hockey at the right time, which is whenever the playoffs start. We've had spurts of great hockey, but as far as putting a 60-minute game together, we haven't quite done that yet.""
The Golden Knights' depth, and offensive potential to break out in any given game, could cause problems for San Jose, which hasn't had the consistency it would like between the pipes. Out of 56 goalies who made 20-plus starts this season, Sharks starter Martin Jones ranks 52nd in save percentage at .896. His backup, Aaron Dell, is last at .886.
And with what appears to be a healthy roster heading into the postseason, Gallant has a stable of forwards he can call upon to play on any line, at any time. For the second year in a row, their mindset isn't about proving they belong on a specific line, it's about how eager they are to play alongside different teammates when needed to help the team.
""You have a good culture, good group of guys, good work ethic, you look around the room and everyone is humble and having fun,"" Eakin said. ""There's gonna be times all year where guys are going down, guys are jumping around, lots of different line combinations. But you get a good, hardworking group of guys without egos, that's when the fun happens. That's when you can gel and bond and develop some chemistry.
""It comes from good, strong work ethic from the guys, good guys that want to do better for each other than just for themselves.""

ATLANTA — Dansby Swanson hit a game-ending single against a five-man infield and the Atlanta Braves, helped by a catcher's interference call, beat the Miami Marlins 4-3 on Sunday.
Miami's Curtis Granderson tied it in the top of the ninth with a pinch-hit homer off Arodys Vizcaíno (1-0).
Freddie Freeman led off Atlanta's ninth win an infield single, the ball glancing off pitcher Adam Conley's glove as he tried to snare the grounder behind his back. Ronald Acuña Jr. followed with an apparent double-play grounder, but home plate umpire Will Little immediately called catcher's interference on Chad Wallach.
A passed ball by Wallach allowed Freeman to advance to third. After Marlins manager Don Mattingly brought in right fielder Rosell Herrera to form a five-man infield, leaving right field vacant, Conley (0-2) walked Markakis to load the bases.
Swanson lined the game-winning single to left field. Swanson homered earlier in the day, too.
Freeman hit a two-run homer off Caleb Smith in the first inning.
Sean Newcomb gave up two runs in seven innings in a possibly important start to protect his place in Atlanta's rotation. The left-hander overcame second-inning control problems to allow only four hits.
Ozzie Albies led off the Atlanta first with a single and scored on Freeman's first homer.
Newcomb gave up his only two walks in the second, including a bases-loaded pass to Miguel Rojas. Smith's single off Newcomb's glove drove in Starlin Castro, who doubled.
The Braves, who were 14-5 against Miami last season, won two of three in the series.
Braves catcher Alex Jackson, recalled from Triple-A Gwinnett before the game, was 0 for 3 in his major league debut.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Marlins: RHP Sergio Romo was available after being hit by a line drive on the bottom of his left hand Saturday night.
Braves: C Brian McCann was placed on the 10-day IL with a right hamstring strain. The catcher position became a concern when McCann's replacement Saturday night, Tyler Flowers, was hit by a pitch on his right hand. X-rays were negative Saturday night, but there was ongoing concern and Flowers was scheduled for further tests Sunday.
ON DECK
Marlins: Following an off day on Monday, Miami opens a three-game series at Cincinnati on Tuesday night when RHP Jose Urena (0-2, 10.38) tries to bounce back from two losses to open the season. Urena was 4-0 with a 2.23 ERA in his final six road starts of 2018.
Braves: RHP Julio Teheran, who has a 2.96 ERA in four career starts at Coors Field, will start when the Braves open a three-game series at Colorado on Monday night.

CLEVELAND — Mike Clevinger struck out 10 and allowed one hit over five scoreless innings, then left with upper back tightness as the Cleveland Indians beat the struggling Toronto Blue Jays 3-1 Sunday to complete a four-game sweep.
Clevinger (1-0) hasn't allowed a run in 12 innings over his first two starts, striking out 22. He retired his first nine hitters, walked Socrates Brito leading off the fourth, then gave up a double to Freddy Galvis. Clevinger fanned Randal Grichuk, Rowdy Tellez and Teoscar Hernández in order, all swinging. He threw 75 pitches in all.
Indians pitchers struck out 16, raising their three-game total to 57.
Toronto dropped to 3-8 and has struck out a major league-leading 111 times.
Carlos Santana, reacquired during the offseason, had an RBI double in the first and is hitting .419 with a 1.067 OPS. Tyler Naquin had three hits, including a run-scoring single in the first. Jose Ramirez added an RBI double in the fifth.
Brad Hand got five outs for his fourth save, completing a three-hitter. Pinch-hitter Lourdes Gurriel grounded into an inning-ending double play in the eighth.
Marcus Stroman (0-2) allowed three runs and six hits in six innings with six strikeouts. Danny Jansen had an RBI single in the eighth off Adam Cimber.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Blue Jays: Justin Smoak has a sore neck and was scratched from the original lineup for the third time in the series. Smoak was 1 for 5 with a double Saturday, but couldn't play in the finale.
Indians: 2B Jason Kipnis had a scheduled day off at his rehab assignment for Triple-A Columbus. He strained his right calf late in spring training. Kipnis hopes to return during the upcoming road trip.
UP NEXT
Blue Jays: RHP Matt Shoemaker (2-0, 0.00 ERA) started Tuesday at Fenway Park, where LHP Chris Sale (0-2, 8.00 ERA) takes the mound in Boston's home opener.
Indians: RHP Corey Kluber (0-2, 5.23 ERA) starts for Cleveland and RHP Jordan Zimmermann (0-0, 0.66 ERA) for the Tigers in the opener of a three-game series at Detroit.

(Reuters) - Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy is fit for Friday's Premier League game against Newcastle United after recovering from a minor groin issue, manager Brendan Rodgers said.
Vardy scored two goals in Leicester's 4-1 victory against relegated Huddersfield Town last Saturday and was substituted towards the end of the match with the problem.
""He's absolutely fine. He felt a slight niggle in his groin towards the end of the game and rather than risk it, we took him off. He's recovered well in the early stages this week and now he's back as sharp as he usually is,"" Rodgers said on Wednesday.
England international Harry Maguire is set to return after missing the last game following the birth of his daughter.
""He looks very happy. Having a child eventually it makes you a better person,"" Rodgers told reporters.
""He obviously didn't train a lot last week, we gave him the week to make sure Fern and the baby were safe, but he's come, looks good and focussed.""
Maguire's defensive colleague Jonny Evans is training again after overcoming a hip issue while midfielder Marc Albrighton is recovering well from a hamstring problem that threatened to end his season prematurely.
Leicester are seventh in the league with 47 points from 33 games.

Golden State guard Stephen Curry left the Warriors' Tuesday game against the New Orleans Pelicans with a sprained right foot, but the ailment isn't expected to affect his readiness for the NBA playoffs.
Curry sustained the non-contact injury when he rolled his foot and ankle while dribbling near the 3-point arc. He immediately fell and lost control of the ball.
The team already was short-handed without key contributors such as Kevin Durant (flu-like symptoms), Klay Thompson (right knee soreness), Andre Iguodala (toe) and Andrew Bogut (rest), yet Golden State beat New Orleans 112-103.
Warriors coach Steve Kerr was relatively tight-lipped about the injury after the game -- even labeling it an ankle issue when the team had earlier reported it as a sprained foot -- but Golden State's in-game actions spoke louder than his words.
After going to the locker room for an examination, Curry returned to the game briefly, an indication the Warriors don't believe the injury is serious.
In fact, it was Curry who waved himself off after hitting a shot, clearly not willing to risk further damage with the playoff opener potentially as close as four days away. He finished with five points in nine minutes of action.
""We think he's going to be fine. He tweaked it,"" Kerr told reporters afterward.
The coach then was asked if the Warriors' Wednesday duel with the Toronto Raptors for the second-best record in the NBA played any role in Curry re-entering the game.
""We would like to win every game,"" Kerr responded. ""Whatever happens with the seedings, we prioritize our health.""
Golden State already had secured the top seed in the Western Conference playoffs.
In 2017, Curry also turned his right ankle on the Pelicans' home court. He missed almost a month because of that injury.

Magic Johnson announced his resignation as Los Angeles Lakers president of basketball operations Tuesday night at an impromptu news conference before the team's regular-season finale.
Johnson, a Hall of Famer from his playing days with the Lakers, said he is resigning because he doesn't enjoy the job.
""I was happier when I wasn't the president (of the Lakers),"" the 59-year-old said.
His announcement came on the heels of an ESPN report that he and coach Luke Walton have not spoken for weeks.
Johnson said team owner Jeanie Buss had not been told of his decision in advance. He expressed his affection for Buss, saying, ""I knew I couldn't be face-to-face and tell her. I couldn't stand to tell her.""
He was annoyed by being sanctioned by the NBA for tampering when talking to or about players on other teams.
Johnson added about the day-to-day NBA business, ""What I didn't like is the backstabbing and the whispering. I don't like a lot of things that went on that didn't have to go on.
""I hope that after (the season ends), the Lakers can head in the right direction, which we are. Injuries really hurt us, but I enjoyed working with Jeanie.""
Walton's future is in jeopardy after he failed to lead the Lakers to the postseason in the first season with LeBron James on the team. The Lakers entered the Tuesday night game against the Portland Trail Blazers with a 37-44 record.
Walton, 39, is set to wrap up his third consecutive sub-.500 season with Los Angeles. He entered Tuesday with a career record of 98-147 for a .400 winning percentage.
Buss has been a strong proponent of Walton but previously said she planned to let Johnson and general manager Rob Pelinka decide his future, according to ESPN. She said during a radio interview last week, ""I will always defer to Magic.""

Kansas City Royals right fielder Whit Merrifield led off the bottom of the first inning Tuesday with an opposite-field triple off the Seattle Mariners' Marco Gonzales to extend his hitting streak to 30 games, tying the club record.
Hall of Famer George Brett had a 30-game hitting streak in 1980, the year he batted .390.
Merrifield owns the longest streak in the majors since Atlanta's Freddie Freeman had a 30-game streak in 2016.
Merrifield's streak is tied (with 21 other players) for the 36th-longest run in major league history. With Merrifield's streak dating back to Sept. 10, 2018, it's the longest multi-season run since Jimmy Rollins hit in 38 straight in 2005-06 for Philadelphia.
It is the longest streak since Baltimore's Eric Davis also hit in 30 straight in 1998. If Merrifield hits safely throughout the rest of the homestand, he would be at 35 games, tied for 11th all-time.
Merrifield, 30, has a .295 career batting average. Last year, he led the major leagues with 192 hits and 45 stolen bases.

SAO PAULO — Brazilian soccer legend Pele arrived home in Brazil after a spell in a French hospital on Tuesday and was immediately taken to a Sao Paulo clinic for further urinary tests, doctors said.
""At the moment, he is undergoing admission exams and his health is good,"" doctors at the Israelite Albert Einstein Hospital said in a brief statement.
Considered by many as the game's finest player and the only man to have won three World Cups, Pele was hospitalized in France last Wednesday after suffering a fever following an event in the city with French World Cup-winner Kylian Mbappe.
The 78-year old former Santos player was diagnosed as suffering from a urinary infection and was treated with antibiotics and released on Monday.
He arrived back in his home state on Tuesday morning.
Doctors said the urinary infection had been cured but did not give more details about what were believed to be routine tests at the hospital where he has been treated on several occasions previously.

INDIANAPOLIS — D'Angelo Russell scored 20 points and Joe Harris added 19 on Sunday, leading the Brooklyn Nets to a 108-96 victory over the Indiana Pacers and back into the NBA playoffs for the first time in four years.
The Nets moved into position to clinch when Miami lost in overtime at Toronto earlier in the day. It's also the first time since 2014-15 the Nets have not posted a losing record.
Domantas Sabonis finished with 17 points and 12 rebounds to lead the Pacers. Thaddeus Young scored 16 in a game coach Nate McMillan promised to closely monitor the minutes his players logged.
And Brooklyn wasted no time in taking full advantage of that opportunity to end the NBA's sixth-longest active playoff drought.
The Nets scored the first nine points and forced three turnovers in less than two minutes, an early barrage that forced Indiana to spend most of the game playing catch-up.
Twice the Pacers took the lead on 3-pointers, from Myles Turner and Wesley Matthews, but Russell answered the second one with a 9-footer to give Brooklyn a 19-18 lead with 4:19 left in the first quarter.
Indiana never led again.
Instead, the Nets steadily extended the lead. They were up 52-44 at the half, scored the last seven points of the third quarter to make it 82-69 and used two 3s early in the fourth to build a 95-78 cushion.
TIP-INS
Nets: Also ended a nine-game losing streak in the series and a seven-game losing streak at Indiana to avoid a second straight season sweep. ... Caris LeVert finished with 18 points while Spencer Dinwiddie and Jarrett Allen each scored 12. Dinwiddie had six assists. Allen had eight rebounds. ... Brooklyn was 11 of 36 on 3s, moving within 16 of breaking the franchise record (1,041) set last season. ... The Nets had a 52-33 rebounding advantage including a 17-5 edge in offensive rebounds. ... Russell's streak of four straight games with 25 or more points ended. ... DeMarre Carroll left midway through the third quarter and headed to the locker room with an undisclosed injury. He did not return to the game.
Pacers: Have lost five of seven and their last two home games to fall to close out the regular season at 29-12 at home. ... Sabonis recorded his 30th double-double of the season. ... Bojan Bogdanovic had 13 points, while Cory Joseph added 12. ... Myles Turner finished with six points, four rebounds and three blocks before leaving with a sore right ankle midway through the third quarter. He did not return. ... Darren Collison was 2 of 12 from the field and missed all four of his 3-pointers after missing the previous three games with an injured groin. He had four points and six assists.
UP NEXT
Nets: Will celebrate their playoff berth by closing the regular season at home against Miami on Wednesday.
Pacers: Can pick up their first season sweep of the Hawks since 2004-05 with a win at Atlanta on Wednesday.

LONDON — Manchester City forward Raheem Sterling said more players need to speak out when they suffer racism if the problem is to be eradicated from the game, but disagreed with the proposal of walking off the pitch in response.
Sterling has earned widespread support for his stand on the subject in the wake of racist abuse he and other players encountered during England's Euro 2020 qualifier in Montenegro.
Earlier this season, he also accused sections of the British media of fuelling the problem with a negative portrayal of young black players.
""I don't think I'm trying to make a difference, or making a difference. As much as I can do is raise awareness,"" Sterling told reporters ahead of Manchester City's Champions League quarter-final first leg at Tottenham Hotspur on Tuesday.
""It's about speaking about what you have experienced and some people have probably shied away from that.
""If more players speak up then the better it will be.""
When asked if he would support walking off the pitch in response to any abuse, as several Premier League managers have recently backed, Sterling said staying on and winning the game was the better response.
""I wouldn't personally agree with it (walking off), because I think to go out and win the game would hurt them even more. Score a goal or win the match, that's a better feeling, that beats them,"" he added.
Several incidents of racism were reported in the English Championship at the weekend and Watford's Troy Deeney said he had removed abusive comments from his Instagram feed.
""To me, this isn't a game,"" Deeney, who scored in Watford's 3-2 FA Cup semi-final win over Wolves on Sunday, said.
""When you racially abuse my family or myself I have to take measures to prevent young people seeing these comments and thinking that it's acceptable, and having to expose people I care about to these small-minded people.""
Tottenham defender Danny Rose, who was also subjected to racial abuse in Montenegro, said last week he ""could not wait to leave football"" after becoming frustrated with the way the authorities are dealing with the problem.
""I respect his comments and it's a shame to hear that,"" Sterling said. ""For someone like him -- and not everyone can take it the same way -- it's not a nice thing to hear.""
Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino was asked whether he had spoken to Rose about his comments.
""It's a very delicate situation, it's not easy, it's very personal how you manage your emotion,"" Pochettino said.
""We're here trying to help him and everyone that can feel that emotion of being abused. It's a thing that we are of course fighting all together to try to stop.""
BEYOND FOOTBALL
Pochettino said the issue was nothing new and that it was a problem that reached beyond football, even if the likes of Rose and Sterling had brought it into the spotlight.
""It's a thing in our society that we need to fight and be against all together to stop that happening again,"" he said.
""It's not only that Danny suffered the other day with Sterling and different people. It happens with people in the street. With Danny and Sterling of course we're very sorry for them but they have the capacity and the power because they're famous people who can denounce it. How many people on the outside cannot say anything, only can go home and cry?""
Tottenham's South Korean forward Son Heung-min has also been a target for abuse and said players must fight together.
""We should just protect the player who gets racism and fight all together,"" Son said.

GLENDALE, Ariz. — Mark Scheifele and Kyle Connor each had a goal and an assist and the Winnipeg Jets beat the Arizona Coyotes 4-2 Saturday night to earn home-ice advantage in the first round of the playoffs.
Jacob Trouba and Nikolaj Ehlers also scored, and Blake Wheeler had his 71st assist for Winnipeg, which won just two of its last seven games (2-4-1) to give up a four-point lead in the Central Division. Nashville won earlier Saturday night to take its second straight division title, edging the Jets by one point.
Connor Hellebuyck stopped 19 shots as the Jets finished tied with St. Louis, but will have home-ice in the opening-round series due to a tiebreaker with more regulation/overtime wins.
Alex Galchenyuk and Brad Richardson scored for Arizona, and Calvin Pickard finished with 28 saves.
Scheifele scored his 38th goal to tie the score late in the first period, after Galchenyuk's 10tj had given the Coyotes a 1-0 lead 2:21 in.
Winnipeg then scored three times in the second to take control. Trouba put the Jets ahead for good with his eighth at 2:35, and Connor scored his 34th to make it 3-1 with 9:55 left in the period — just 2 seconds after a power play ended but before the Coyotes' fifth skater could get in the play. Ehlers gave Winnipeg a three-goal lead with 21st with 4:39 left.
Richardson capped the scoring with his 19th about 3 1/2 minutes into the third.
NOTES: Hellenbuyck played in 63 regular-season games, third in the league among goalies behind Minnesota's Devyn Dubnyk (67) and Montreal's Carey Price (66). ... Coyotes G Darcy Kuemper finished with a 2.33 goals-against average, the lowest among goalies who played at leasts 50 games. Kuemper and Tampa Bay's Andrei Vasilevskiy had a .925 save percentage, the highest among goalies with at least 50 games.
UP NEXT
Jets: Open the first round of the playoffs at home against St. Louis.
Coyotes: Missed the playoffs for the seventh consecutive season.

WASHINGTON — Bill Hamid had his fourth shutout in six games this season and D.C. United tied the Montreal Impact 0-0 on Tuesday night.
United (3-1-2) rebounded from its first loss of the season last Saturday. Montreal (2-2-2) concluded its six-game road stretch with a scoreless draw in consecutive games.
Hamid made a diving save in the 55th minute of Zachary Brault-Guillard's breakaway shot from the corner of the 6-yard box. Montreal goalkeerper Evan Bush didn't have a save in recording his second shutout of the season.
Both teams were playing without their goal-scoring leaders. Wayne Rooney, who was suspended following a red card on Saturday, has four goals this season for United and injured midfielder Ignacio Piatti is tied atop Montreal's list with three goals. Maxi Urruti also missed the game for the Impact due to a suspension.

MINNEAPOLIS — The buzzer sounded and Tom Izzo walked stoically across the Final Four floor to shake hands with Texas Tech counterpart Chris Beard, no doubt complimenting him on a fine defensive performance.
It's a walk Izzo has made a lot over the past two decades.
Frustrated all night by the Red Raiders' stingy defense, and unable to get guards Cassius Winston and Matt McQuaid into much rhythm, Michigan State fell once again on college basketball's grandest stage. The Spartans' 61-51 defeat in the national semifinals Saturday night was their sixth straight trip to the tournament's final weekend without hoisting a championship trophy.
It also continued a maddening run of disappointment for the Big Ten, which hasn't had a national champion since Mateen Cleaves and the Spartans won Izzo's only title in 2000.
The Spartans certainly had their chances Saturday night.
They trailed just 23-21 at halftime in the kind of defensive slugfest everyone anticipated, and it was still a nip-and-tuck game early in the second half. And even when the Red Raiders pushed the lead to 48-35 — their biggest of the game — the Spartans never quite seemed out of it.
The Big Ten's regular-season and tournament champions kept pecking away, including a series of free throws that nipped into Texas Tech's lead. When Aaron Henry followed two foul shots of his own with a big basket with 2:51 left, the deficit was down to 52-51 and the green-clad fans were stirring.
That was the closest the Spartans got down the stretch.
Jarrett Culver answered with a scooping layup for the Red Raiders, and Winston committed a silly offensive foul at the other end to give the ball back. McQuaid missed a wide open 3-pointer on Michigan State's next trip down floor, and Culver added a free throw to extend the Red Raiders' lead.
The Spartans' last chance to make it close ended when Xavier Tillman was stripped by Texas Tech big man Norense Odiase with 1:19 to go, and the Red Raiders efficiently put the game away.
Izzo shook Beard's hand as the Red Raiders set their sights on Virginia in the final.
The defeats Michigan State has endured in the Final Four over the years have come in all flavors: They've fallen as high seeds expected to do great things and low seeds that surpassed expectations, and run into buzz-saws such as Duke and Arizona that were loaded with future NBA prospects and dropped down-to-the-wire nail-biters to the likes of Gordon Hayward and Butler.
On Saturday night, they lost to a team that beat them at their own game.
Izzo prides himself on toughness — in the old days, he'd suit up his guys in shoulder pads and helmets in practice. Yet the Red Raiders beat Michigan State to the punch all night, harassing Sparty on the perimeter and rendering Tillman and fellow forward Kenny Goins ineffective in the paint.
Michigan State wound up shooting 32 percent from the field, went 7 of 24 from the 3-point arc and desperately could have used Joshua Langford, their forward they lost to a season-ending injury.
Winston, who played all 40 minutes, tried to rescue the Spartans in the second half. The Big Ten player of the year wound up with 16 points but he needed 16 shots to get there.
Nobody else gave him much help, either.
The result was a national championship appearance for Texas Tech in its first trip to the Final Four, and another weekend that ended in disappointment for Izzo and the Spartans.

MUMBAI — West Indies are replete with match-winners but consistency will be key to their success in English conditions at this year's World Cup, batting great Brian Lara has said.
Teeming with tearaway fast bowlers and aggressive batsmen, West Indies were once considered invincible and won the opening two editions of the World Cup in 1975 and 1979.
Their glory days, however, are long over and the twice winners had to go through a qualifying tournament to book their spot in the 10-team tournament in England and Wales.
The last bilateral series win for West Indies, who are ranked ninth in one-day internationals, came in 2014 but they showed signs of improvement against England.
Jason Holder's men drew a five-match ODI series against top-ranked England 2-2 at home recently, in a timely boost before the May 30-July 14 showpiece event.
The likes of opening batsman Chris Gayle, all-rounder Andre Russell and spinner Sunil Narine are also much in demand in Twenty20 leagues across the globe.
""Look at the Indian Premier League, look at the leagues around the world, we have got players that are the most wanted in the world,"" Lara, 49, told reporters in Mumbai at a promotional event last week.
""We have got match-winners, but we are going to need a little more than match-winners in English conditions to win the World Cup. We need a team that can create consistency.
""If we can get to the knock-out stages, we can knock out any team. We have seen that in the past. But consistency is going to take us right through to the finals.""
Former West Indies captain Lara, considered one of the very best the Caribbean islands have ever produced, retired after the 2007 World Cup at home with over 10,000 runs in ODIs. He also scored close to 12,000 runs in tests.
Lara credited franchise leagues like the IPL for creating interest among kids in the West Indies and giving young players a platform to showcase their talent before they graduate to international cricket.
West Indies suffered 2-0 losses both in India and Bangladesh late last year but staged a spectacular turnaround in a 2-1 series win against England earlier this year.
The test success augurs well for the side, who are now graduating to a level where they can be competitive against top sides at least at home, said Lara.
""We had a tremendous series against England. We are laying the foundation, the confidence is there,"" Lara added.
""India may have to worry when they come there in July to play against the West Indies because they have a team now that understand the conditions, spirits are high, let's see what we can do against India.
""But, four months ago in October-November we were terrible. So, I'm happy that we have made that little progress in our cricket.""

LOS ANGELES — At the end of a disastrous season in which the Los Angeles Lakers failed to make the playoffs, despite having added LeBron James via free agency, Magic Johnson made the stunning announcement on Tuesday that he was stepping down as the team’s president of basketball operations.
Johnson delivered the news at an impromptu news conference before the Lakers’ regular-season finale, against the Portland Trail Blazers, and he said he had not yet informed Jeanie Buss, the team’s controlling owner. In fact, he had told nearly no one before he addressed a mass of hastily assembled reporters.
“I couldn’t face her to tell her,” he said, referring to Buss. He later added that he would find her at Staples Center to address her in person.
Earvin, I loved working side by side with you. You’ve brought us a long way. We will continue the journey. We love you 💜💛
https://t.co/ofmQl6BtBz
Later, the team released a statement, calling Johnson “not only a Lakers icon, but our family.”
[
Magic Johnson’s biggest moments running the Lakers.
]
“There is no greater Los Angeles Laker than Earvin Johnson,” the statement read, using Johnson’s formal name. “We are deeply grateful to Magic for all that he has done for our franchise — as a player, an ambassador and an executive.”
The statement continued, “As we begin the process of moving forward, we will work in a measured and methodical fashion to make the right moves for the future of our organization.”
“Measured” and “methodical” would be an about-face from the way Johnson stepped down. It was a surreal scene as he fielded questions for nearly 45 minutes after he made his announcement, appearing to hold back tears at times, and repeatedly said that he loved Buss like a sister. He then posed for pictures with team employees, former teammates and a local news anchor.
“I want to go back to having fun,” Johnson, 59, said. “I want to go back to being who I was before taking on this job, and we’re halfway there with LeBron coming. I think this summer, with that other star coming in — whoever’s going to come in — I think this team is going to be in position to really contend for a championship with the growth of the other young players.”
Johnson was named to the post in February 2017 and said at the time that it was “a dream come true.” But on Tuesday he said that he wanted to get back to being a mentor and a businessman, and that he had felt limited in his ability to do those things in his current role.
For example, he said he was upset that he could not attend Dwyane Wade’s final game for the Miami Heat on Tuesday night — or congratulate Russell Westbrook of the Oklahoma City Thunder on Twitter for finishing the regular season averaging another triple-double. (Johnson said the league would have considered it “tampering.”)
Johnson also said that he had received a phone call last week from the tennis star Serena Williams, asking if he would be an adviser to her.
“When Serena called me, wow, that’s who I am,” Johnson said. “I love helping people.”
He added: “I like to be free. And then I got a great life outside of this. What am I doing? I got a beautiful life, so I’m going to go back to that beautiful life, and I’m looking forward to it.”
But there is palace intrigue at play, too — these are the Lakers, after all — and Johnson strongly indicated that he had been leaning toward firing Coach Luke Walton. Buss, though, is known to think highly of Walton, a former Laker who has been the team’s coach for three seasons, and Johnson suggested that he did not want to go through with it.
“I would have to affect someone’s livelihood and their life,” Johnson said, “and I thought about that. That’s not fun for me. That’s not who I am, and then I don’t want to put her in the middle of us, even though she said, ‘Hey, do what you want to do.’ I know she has great love for him.”
The Lakers, who have been downtrodden in recent years, are still one of the most glamorous franchises in the league, and Johnson, who helped the Lakers win five championships as a Hall of Fame point guard, remains
one of the organization’s most popular figures
.
Johnson was hired to replace Jim Buss, the brother of Jeanie Buss. Johnson, who had previously been a partial owner of the team as well, worked alongside Rob Pelinka, a former agent, who was brought in as the team’s general manager. (Johnson said that he had not told Pelinka of his decision to step down, either.)
While Johnson had some memorable moments at the helm of the Lakers’ operation, the roster that he and Pelinka built around James was widely considered inadequate. After losing to Portland in their finale, the Lakers had a record of 37-45, which assured them of
missing the playoffs for the sixth consecutive season
. It is the first losing effort by a James-led team since the star forward’s rookie season in 2003-04, when his Cleveland Cavaliers went 35-47.
On Tuesday, Johnson preached patience.
“I’m excited about the direction,” he said before he headed out the door.

Edwin Encarnacion hit a pair of home runs in the sixth inning, and the visiting Seattle Mariners scored eight times in the frame to earn a 13-5 victory over the Kansas City Royals on Monday.
The Mariners have scored five or more runs in 11 of their first 12 games and became the first team in the major leagues to win 10 games.
Encarnacion became the first major-leaguer to hit two home runs in an inning in almost three years. Mark Trumbo of the Los Angeles Angels did in on April 15, 2016, at Texas. Seattle also got homers from Daniel Vogelbach, Dylan Moore and Jay Bruce.
Roenis Elias (1-0) picked up the win, pitching three scoreless, hitless innings of relief. Royals starter Homer Bailey (0-1) gave up seven runs on eight hits, including three home runs, in five-plus innings.
Orioles 12, A's 4
Jonathan Villar homered and had four RBIs while Cedric Mullins tripled twice and drove in three as Baltimore defeated visiting Oakland.
While most of the Orioles were enjoying a big offensive night, it was the opposite for Baltimore's Chris Davis. He set a major league record for the longest hitless streak by a position player, going 0-for-5 to leave him 0-for-49 dating back to last year. Eugenio Velez had the previous record of 0-for-46.
Trey Mancini hit a solo homer in the first inning, and Mullins delivered a two-run triple in the second while scoring on a throwing error on the same play to give Baltimore an early 4-0 lead. The early margin helped the Orioles stop a four-game losing streak.
Cubs 10, Pirates 0
Ben Zobrist and Kyle Schwarber each drove in two runs, and Chicago rode a six-run second inning to a victory over Pittsburgh in the home opener at Wrigley Field.
The Cubs' second win in eight games came with a caveat, as starter Jon Lester left during the third inning because of left hamstring tightness. Lester struck out four, walked one and gave up three hits in two-plus innings before four relievers combined to finish Chicago's first shutout.
Brad Brach (1-0), who replaced Lester, gave up one hit in two innings. Pittsburgh starter Jameson Taillon (0-2), who gave up six unearned runs and four hits, left after two innings and will be re-evaluated after he took at least a glancing blow to the head on a comebacker by Anthony Rizzo.
Braves 8, Rockies 6
Ronald Acuna Jr. hit his third home run of the season to spark Atlanta past Colorado in Denver.
Acuna was 2-for-3, scored three runs and hit a two-run homer in the first inning to help give the Braves their sixth win in the past seven games. Dansby Swanson drove in three runs, and Nick Markakis was 3-for-4 with two RBIs for Atlanta.
Braves starter Julio Teheran (1-1) pitched five innings and allowed six runs, all coming in his last inning. The struggling Atlanta bullpen closed the game with four scoreless innings, handing the Rockies their fourth straight loss and their eighth defeat in the past nine games.
Astros 4, Yankees 3
Robinson Chirinos hit a two-run, game-tying double in the seventh inning, and Carlos Correa drove in the go-ahead run an inning later as Houston rallied for a victory over visiting New York.
Chirinos drove home Yuli Gurriel and Tyler White with his two-out double off the wall in front of the Houston bullpen, striking his blow against Yankees left-hander Zack Britton, who surrendered a leadoff single to Correa after entering in relief of starter Masahiro Tanaka.
The Astros stretched their winning streak to four games. Ryan Pressly (1-0) earned the win with a perfect eighth inning before Roberto Osuna notched his third save with a six-pitch ninth.
Angels 5, Brewers 2
Mike Trout did not hit a home run for the first time in five games, but he did steal a home run from reigning National League MVP Christian Yelich, helping Los Angeles extend its winning streak to four games with a win over Milwaukee at Anaheim, Calif.
Trout had at least one homer in four consecutive games (five total), but Brewers pitchers were able to keep him in the ballpark. Trout went 0-for-2 (strikeout, lineout) with two walks. He made up for it with his defense, reaching above the fence in left-center in the third inning to rob Yelich of what would have been his sixth homer of the year.
The Angels got a two-run homer from Tommy La Stella, a solo homer from Andrelton Simmons and a two-run blast by Justin Bour. Yelich wound up 2-for-4 with two singles.
Padres 6, Giants 5
Franmil Reyes capped a San Diego rally with a pinch-hit, two-run home run in the seventh inning as the visiting Padres overcame a five-run deficit and a Kevin Pillar grand slam to overtake San Francisco.
Fernando Tatis Jr. and Wil Myers also homered for the Padres, who had won three in a row before losing the finale of a series at St. Louis on Sunday.
The Giants, who have lost all three of their series this season, staked Madison Bumgarner to a five-run lead in the fourth inning. However, the ace left-hander wound up allowing five runs in six innings.
Phillies 4, Nationals 3
Rhys Hoskins hit two solo homers, including the tiebreaker on a full-count pitch in the last of the sixth, and Philadelphia beat visiting Washington.
Hoskins added an insurance run in eighth with a homer off Justin Miller to make it 4-2. It was the fourth multi-homer game of Hoskins' career.
The first homer came off Anibal Sanchez (0-1), who was making his second start for the Nationals after coming over from the Atlanta Braves. He gave up seven hits and three runs in 5 2/3 innings with six strikeouts and two walks.
Rays 5, White Sox 1
Blake Snell allowed one run in six innings, and Tampa Bay continued to match its best start in franchise history with a win at Chicago. Snell (2-1) gave up six hits while striking out 11 and walking none.
Willy Adames had three hits, a walk and scored two runs in the No. 9 spot, and Avisail Garcia, Daniel Robertson and Yandy Diaz had two hits each for Tampa Bay, which has won eight of its first 11 games for the second time in team history.
Coming into the game, Tampa Bay starting pitchers had not allowed a run in their past 31 innings, and Snell had thrown eight straight shutout innings. He ran that streak to 12 before Jose Rondon hit a solo homer in the fifth to make it 4-1.
Cardinals 4, Dodgers 3
Marcell Ozuna lined a two-run homer, and Paul Goldschmidt scored the decisive run on a wild pitch as St. Louis beat visiting Los Angeles.
Jose Martinez added a run-scoring single as St. Louis halted the Dodgers' five-game winning streak. Los Angeles didn't trail for 42 innings until the Cardinals moved ahead in the bottom of the sixth inning.
Cardinals starter Miles Mikolas (1-1) gave up three runs and five hits over six innings. He struck out three and walked one. John Gant pitched two hitless innings, and Jordan Hicks finished up for his second save.

DALLAS — Dirk Nowitzki’s final N.B.A. game will take place in the same city — San Antonio — where he played what he considers the most important game of his life as well as what many rank as the best game of his career.
Wednesday’s date with the San Antonio Spurs is suddenly poised to be recorded as the final outing of Nowitzki’s 21 seasons with the Dallas Mavericks — thanks to the retirement announcement he sprang on the American Airlines Center crowd after Dallas’s 120-109 victory Tuesday night over the Phoenix Suns.
After scoring a season-high 30 points, albeit on 31 shot attempts, Nowitzki punctuated a postgame ceremony arranged to honor his long and decorated career by announcing that he is indeed retiring from the sport.
“As you guys might expect, this is my last home game,” Nowitzki told the fans, finally addressing his future after trying to dodge questions on that topic all season in a futile attempt to avoid a so-called farewell tour.
The Mavericks’ regular-season finale on the Spurs’ floor thus provides Nowitzki with a serendipitous opportunity to go out where he broke in. It was a 33-point, 14-rebound performance in the 1998 Nike Hoop Summit Game in San Antonio as a 19-year-old that, in Nowitzki’s words, “literally changed my life,” convincing Dallas that it had to do anything it could to draft the little-known German.
Nowitzki, 40, went on to overcome a string of playoff disappointments and lead the Mavericks to the only championship in franchise history in 2011. His 21 consecutive seasons with one team is an N.B.A. record — and the 37 points and 15 rebounds he delivered against the five-time champion Tim Duncan in Game 7 of the Western Conference finals in San Antonio in 2006 is widely regarded as his most complete single-game performance.
As the game’s sixth career leading scorer with 31,540 points, Nowitzki is often described as the best European import in N.B.A. history and credited with ushering in the modern era of power forward play in which players of all sizes were not only encouraged but expected to shoot proficiently from long range.
“He’s our Roger Staubach,” said the longtime Mavericks General Manager Donnie Nelson, who did the loudest lobbying to persuade his father Don, then the Mavericks’ coach and general manager, to make any maneuvers necessary to select Nowitzki in the 1998 draft.
Mark Cuban, the team’s owner, announced recently that the reluctant Nowitzki was getting an ornate send-off against the Suns “whether he wants it or not.” The Mavericks duly arranged for five of Nowitzki’s favorite players growing up — Charles Barkley, Scottie Pippen, Shawn Kemp, Detlef Schrempf and even Larry Bird — to fly in, stay out of public view during the game and then emerge to take part in the ceremony.
The game itself, predictably, was also all about Nowitzki, with teammates, particularly the league’s rookie of the year favorite, Luka Doncic, feeding him incessantly as fans bayed at him to shoot at every opportunity.
Before tipoff, Nowitzki jokingly asked a team staffer to look up how many shots Kobe Bryant took on the way to scoring 60 points in Bryant’s farewell game in April 2016. Informed that Bryant hoisted 50 shots that night, Nowitzki conceded that he very likely wouldn’t reach that territory, but promised to “let it fly.” He wound up taking Dallas’s first eight shots, scored 19 points in the first half and finished with 30 points on 11-for-31 shooting to match what his longtime rival Dwyane Wade of the Miami Heat managed in Wade’s final home game before retirement Tuesday night.
The Suns’ Jamal Crawford, at 39, remarkably countered with 51 points, making Crawford the first player in league history to crack the 50-point mark with four different teams. The spotlight, though, never left Nowitzki, who revealed at a news conference after the game that he had decided in recent days that his surgically repaired left foot could not sustain a 22nd season.
“I would love to be there for K.P. and Luka and all these young guys and have fun with them and mentor them as much as I can,” Nowitzki said, referring to Dallas’s embryonic star duo of Kristaps Porzingis and Doncic. “But it just doesn’t make any sense anymore physically. I think mentally I could still do it — I can always push myself to work out hard — but physically the foot is just not quite there.”
Said Doncic, whose 21 points, 16 rebounds and 11 assists were overshadowed, like Crawford’s scoring outburst, by the Nowitzki party, “I was emotional, and the whole team was emotional, so imagine him.”
Nowitzki acknowledged that he has been increasingly weepy over the past week, as the end of the regular season for the lottery-bound Mavericks — and a decision he could no longer delay — drew near. But he was openly giddy when he spoke of the former stars who shared in Tuesday’s festivities, proclaiming it an “amazing” evening.
“They did this right,” he said.
Asked if he was bothered at all that one more road game remained on Dallas’s schedule, as opposed to closing out the regular season at home, Nowitzki scoffed at the idea that the league’s schedule-makers had wronged him.
“I’m totally fine with it,” he said. “The N.B.A. can’t keep up with the plans of a million players. They didn’t know if I was going to retire this season, last season or whatever.”
There was likewise no protest from Holger Geschwindner, Nowitzki’s longtime shooting coach and the former captain of West Germany’s 1972 Olympic team. Geschwindner is known in Mavericks circles for being far harder to please than his star pupil, but he embraced the storybook nature of Nowitzki’s returning to the scene of his breakthrough performance at the Hoop Summit by traveling to South Texas one last time.
“I think it’s great,” Geschwindner said. “That’s where it all started.”
An earlier version of this article incorrectly described Dwyane Wade’s game Tuesday night. It was his final home game in Miami before retirement, not his final game.

Former Tennessee women's basketball player Kellie Harper will be the next coach at Tennessee, multiple outlets reported Monday.
Harper is 118-79 in six seasons as the head coach at Missouri State, leading the Lady Bears to a 25-10 record this season that included a run to the Sweet 16 as an 11th seed. Missouri State lost to Stanford in a regional semifinal.
Harper would be the replacement for Holly Warlick, who was fired March 27 after posting a 172-67 record in seven seasons.
Harper, known as Kelly Jolly during her playing days, helped the Lady Vols win NCAA titles in 1996, 1997 and 1998 as a point guard under legendary coach Pat Summitt.
She also has been the head coach at Western Carolina (2004-09) and North Carolina State (2009-2013), with a career record of 285-208. She has led all three of her programs to the NCAA Tournament but was let go by North Carolina State after three consecutive seasons without an NCAA appearance.
Warlick was promoted from associate head coach in April 2012 when Summitt stepped down amid health concerns. In all, Warlick spent 38 years with the Volunteers as a player and a coach.
Warlick went to the NCAA Tournament every year as the Tennessee head coach and led the Vols to regular-season SEC championships in 2013 and 2015. But the team's success slipped in the past few years, with Tennessee finishing 19-13 this season after eking into the NCAA Tournament as an 11th seed -- its lowest in school history.
While the Vols maintained their streak of making every NCAA Tournament since the event began in 1982, they lost in the first round to UCLA. Tennessee has failed to finish better than tied for fourth in the SEC in the past four seasons.

LOS ANGELES — Hours after Magic Johnson abruptly resigned as the Los Angeles Lakers’ president of basketball operations, and mere minutes after LeBron James’s first season as the franchise cornerstone ended with a buzzer-beating loss, James left Staples Center on Tuesday night without speaking to reporters,
trailed only by security officers
and questions about the team’s future.
It was not the season anyone envisioned for the Lakers, who had upended the N.B.A. by signing James last summer with the hype and expectation of returning the franchise to its glory years. One of the most storied teams in the league, the Lakers have not won a championship in nine years, and Los Angeles is frustrated, hungry and impatient.
Instead, the team collected nearly as many injuries as losses. James, who will miss the N.B.A. playoffs beginning Saturday for the first time in 14 years, watched the final six games of the season from the bench as the team looked to preserve him for next season. His next buzzy stop is a studio lot as the star of “Space Jam 2,” which
he has said is set to begin filming
this summer.
For the Lakers (37-45), all the drama was off the court, right up to the end, with Johnson’s abrupt announcement so out-of-the-blue that he had not even told his boss, the team owner Jeanie Buss, before wading into a gaggle of reporters.
[Here is a look at Magic Johnson’s
biggest moments
as team president.]
On Wednesday morning, Johnson, 59, wrote on Twitter that he considers himself a “Laker for life.”
He announced in 1991 that he was H.I.V. positive but said Tuesday that he was in good health and it was not a factor in his decision.
Johnson had sealed a $154 million, four-year deal for James — two greats fulfilling their needs: Johnson to restore luster to a glamorous team; James to close out his career as a Laker and develop his business and entertainment interests centered on Hollywood.
And now they both left Staples Center with a losing record and a team in chaos.
In some ways, it was the perfect finale to a season that trafficked in dysfunction.
So there was the coach, Luke Walton, saying what losing coaches always say: essentially, wait until next year. His job may have been saved when Johnson quit, but he would not talk about that.
“We have a lot of time to work and get better,” Walton said late Tuesday after the Lakers’ loss to the Portland Trail Blazers. “Let’s organize and prioritize what we need to do so we can give ourselves a better chance next season.”
It was a wasted season for everyone involved, and James is as polarizing as ever, even in Los Angeles, where as much as fans banked on him, they also retained a degree of skepticism that this was all real.
Jonas Never, a prominent Los Angeles-based street artist, found that out the hard way.
“Honestly,” Never said in a telephone interview, “Lakers fans
are the trickiest
.”
Last July, he had talked a restaurant owner in Venice Beach into allowing him to paint a
mural of James
in a Lakers jersey to commemorate his arrival: 75 cans of spray paint in 12 hours for the “King of L.A.”
It did not take long for the mural to be vandalized — not just once, but twice in a span of four days. The first time, it was salvageable. Someone had defaced the wall with the words “We Don’t Want You” and “No King,” along with “3-6,” a reference to James’s losing record in the N.B.A. finals. But Never was able to restore the mural. (“A two-minute fix,” he said.)
The second time, someone splashed yellow paint all over James’s face, and Never had no choice but to paint over it.
“If it had been a car, it would have been totaled,” he said.
To be fair, most fans were excited about James. The news media coverage was
breathless
. And perhaps no member of the ticket-paying public had invested more in LeBron-to-L.A. than Jacob Emrani, a personal injury lawyer from Beverly Hills, Calif., who had purchased space for 40 James-themed billboards in the run-up to free agency.
“I definitely didn’t think it was going to be something where we missed the playoffs or thought, ‘What the hell is happening here?’ ” Emrani said in an interview. “I’m disappointed in the breaks we got, but I’m not necessarily disappointed in LeBron. We were in fourth place when he went down.”
Emrani was referring to what may have been the season’s turning point: the Lakers’ ill-fated Christmas Day game against the Golden State Warriors, which James himself cited in
a recent interview with Spectrum SportsNet
, the Lakers’ broadcast partner. The Lakers were playing solid basketball at the time — in fact, they clobbered the Warriors to improve their record to 20-14 — but James injured his groin in the third quarter and wound up missing the next 17 games. The Lakers went into a tailspin without him.
“Disappointed in my body,” James told Spectrum SportsNet, adding: “Because I knew exactly where we were at that point. And we just were never able to get back from that.”
Once James returned, the team’s front office unsuccessfully tried to engineer a trade for another big star, the New Orleans Pelicans’ Anthony Davis — this, after James had told ESPN that it would be “amazing” to play alongside Davis.
The plan appeared to be to essentially trade away the rest of the team. The fallout was clear: Whatever fragile bonds that remained in the home locker room at Staples Center seemed to fray at the seams.
For many fans, it was impossible to dissociate James from the failed trade — James and Davis share an agent, Rich Paul — and much of the mess that followed.
“Nearly everyone on the roster was involved in those trade rumors,” Never said. “How can you really feel wanted if you think you’re going to be packing your locker the next day?”
As the losses mounted, so did the criticisms of James: that he appeared detached from his teammates, that basketball was secondary to his growing interest in his entertainment company, that his body was finally breaking down after so many years of athletic genius, that he was no longer capable of carrying a team to a title.
But in the 55 games that James did play this season, he was pretty good. He averaged 27.4 points, 8.5 rebounds and 8.3 assists a game while shooting 51 percent from the field. Besides, a long summer may benefit him after so many extended playoff runs.
“The only thing that was hard was that he got hurt,” Walton said late Tuesday night. “It takes time to build a relationship with somebody. But as our relationship grew and I got to see what it was like coaching him, it was great. And I believe if we could have stayed healthy, we would have had a very successful season. He’s an incredible player.”
For his part, James told Spectrum SportsNet that he wanted to use the summer to get his body back to “120 percent” ahead of training camp — even as he moonlights on the set of “Space Jam 2.” He has been adamant that his work in entertainment will not interfere with his work on the basketball court.
The question is whether one bad season will become two. So much hinges on the summer as the Lakers look to add another star to their roster. (Emrani said he had plans for more billboards, though he declined to say which top-tier free agents he would target.) James has said that he will be as involved in the team’s recruiting efforts as possible.
“I’m looking forward to seeing who jumps in the car with me and wants to take this ride to the top,” James said in his interview with Spectrum SportsNet. “I know what I bring to the game. I know my commitment to the game. I’ve never cheated the game, and throughout my career, it’s always given back to me.”
Back in Venice Beach, Never
painted a new mural
during the middle of the N.F.L. season, replacing LeBron James with Derwin James, a safety for the Los Angeles Chargers. The mural has been up for months, Never said, and no one has touched it.
An earlier version of this article misstated when LeBron James injured his groin during a game against the Golden State Warriors on Christmas Day. It was in the third quarter, not the first half.

AUGUSTA, Ga. — Jordan Spieth visited the Augusta National media interview room almost unnoticed for his assigned rendezvous with the press on Tuesday, like a guest invited to make up the numbers.
Only a handful of journalists bothered turning up to hear what the 2015 Masters champion had to say, a far cry from the not-so-long ago days when he packed out the house, seemingly destined to become an all-time great.
Though Spieth is only 25, and time is still on his side, his star has waned considerably since he captured the 2017 British Open, his third major title, leaving him only a PGA Championship short of the career grand slam of all four modern majors.
He became the second player after Jack Nicklaus to complete three legs of the slam before the age of 24, rarefied company to be sure.
Spieth almost pulled off a comeback for the ages in the final round last year, storming from nine strokes behind Patrick Reed to finish third with a closing 64.
But Spieth has regressed since then, so much so that a tie for 30th at the Texas Open on Sunday was his best stroke play result all year.
But he struck an upbeat note on Tuesday as he assessed his chances this week.
""My expectations are high,"" he said.
""I feel great about the state of my game right now. I feel like my recent results aren't a tell of where my game is actually at, and I feel I've made a lot of strides in the last couple of days in the tee-to-green game.
""Really just off the tee, my long game has been the only separation from being able to win golf tournaments over the last month or so.""
Not everyone is convinced.
""His golf swing has changed so much, it's almost been completely stripped of all its athleticism,"" Golf Channel analyst Brandel Chamblee said of Spieth in a conference call last week.
""His swing has completely changed, and it looks to me like he's in a very tough spot, and who knows if he'll ever find his way back.
""A lot of people who go down that road can't remember how to get back home.""
That might sound a little bit negative but there are no more guarantees in golf than in any other walk of life.
Spieth of course was much more optimistic.
""I feel really good about my game, where it's at, heading into this week,"" he said.
""It's just a matter of trust in the stuff that I'm working on... I don't feel like there's any added pressure this week.
""I feel kind of under the radar, which is really nice. That changes day-to-day out here though.""

Chicago Cubs ace Jon Lester will be placed on the 10-day injured list Tuesday and miss ""one, maybe two"" starts with a hamstring strain, manager Joe Maddon announced.
The left-hander got hurt while running the bases during the Cubs' six-run second inning in Monday's home opener against the Pittsburgh Pirates. He doubled home a run and later scored from second base on a single by Ben Zobrist.
Lester, 35, attempted to come out and pitch in the third inning but was removed from the game due to discomfort. Chicago went on to win, 10-0.
Despite the injury, Lester maintained his sense of humor. ""Sometimes when you have elite speed these things can happen,"" he tweeted Tuesday morning.
Lester is 1-0 with a 2.57 ERA in three starts this season. The five-time All-Star is 178-98 with a 3.49 ERA in 14 major league seasons.

(Reuters) - Barcelona's Luis Suarez can expect a hostile reception from Manchester United fans in Wednesday's Champions League clash but that will be nothing new for the fiery Uruguayan.
Suarez, who joined Barca in 2014 from United's fierce rivals Liverpool, has 20 goals in La Liga this season, trailing only team mate and close friend Lionel Messi in the scoring charts.
His time in England was similarly prolific but punctuated with incidents that left a sour taste.
United will know all about the threat Suarez poses on the pitch when they host Barca in the quarter-final first leg, but also the ugly aspect of his game which sometimes rears its head.
The Uruguayan inspired Liverpool to a 3-1 win over United in 2011, but his behaviour in the same fixture the following season garnered a lot more attention.
Suarez was found guilty following an FA investigation of racially abusing United's then defender Frenchman Patrice Evra and hit with an eight-game ban, although he denied the charge.
That incident tarnished Suarez's time in England, in which he also got a lengthy suspension for biting Chelsea's Serbian defender Branislav Ivanovic and was repeatedly accused of diving.
In Spain, his combative playing style has rarely endeared him to opposing fans but Barca defender Gerard Pique believes he remains vital to the Catalans.
""There are many players that when they are on your team they are indispensable and when they are your opponents you hate them, and Luis is like that,"" Pique said ahead of Wednesday's game.
""Having Luis with us is incredible, he gives you so many things. He scores goals, he provides assists, he defends, he creates space for his team mates. He is a fundamental piece of our team.""
Remarkably, Suarez has not scored away from home in the Champions League since September 2015, yet he tends to thrive in intimidating situations like the one that is bound to await him at Old Trafford.
He struck a superb goal to break the deadlock against Atletico Madrid in Saturday's tense Liga title showdown, curling a shot into the far corner and becoming the first player all season to beat Atleti keeper Jan Oblak from outside the area.
In his previous outing at Villarreal, Suarez scored deep in stoppage time to rescue a 4-4 draw, while in February he struck twice in a 3-0 win at Barca's eternal rivals Real Madrid.
Suarez was also decisive in his first trip back to England after leaving Liverpool for Barca, netting twice in a 2-1 win at Manchester City in the Champions League in 2015.
United fans gave their former player Angel di Maria a fiery reception when he returned in February with Paris St Germain yet it inspired the Argentine to star in his side's 2-0 win.
The sight of Suarez is likely to ignite far more fire among United fans but they should beware of awakening a player who seemingly relishes the feeling that it is him against the world.

BLOOMINGTON, Ind. — Bob Knight returned to Indiana University on Saturday, the former basketball coach's first public appearance on campus since he was fired almost 19 years ago.
Knight returned to watch the Hoosiers' baseball game against Penn State from the press box. The Big Ten Network was broadcasting the game when Knight made the impromptu golf cart ride to the field.
Athletic director Fred Glass has repeatedly made overtures to bring back Knight. Each time Knight declined.

(Reuters) - Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk says he voted for Manchester City's Raheem Sterling to be named PFA player of the year.
Van Dijk is one of the favourites for the award after helping Liverpool deliver a sustained Premier League title challenge, while Sterling has scored 15 league goals for City, their rivals for the league crown.
""I voted for Raheem Sterling,"" Van Dijk told reporters. ""I did what I thought and I thought he deserves it. He's had a fantastic season. I could have voted for Bernardo Silva as well and another couple of players from Manchester City.
""But I'm just being honest. I think he has improved a lot as a player.""
PFA rules prohibit players from voting for their team mates.
Liverpool, who have kept 17 clean sheets in the league this season, are also still in the hunt for the Champions League trophy and play Porto in the first leg of their quarter-final later on Tuesday.
Van Dijk said he was focused on winning with the team, not on individual accolades.
""Individual trophies? I don't know,"" the Dutchman added. ""Of course, you're going to be proud, that's something you have to be, but all the hard work in the training ground is something we all did together.
""It is to win something as a team, a collective thing as a club. Hopefully that is something that will happen.""

CLEVELAND — Carlos Carrasco became the first Indians pitcher since at least 1908 to strike out 12 over five innings and Cleveland beat the Toronto Blue Jays 7-2 Saturday.
Carrasco (1-1) was overpowering a week after struggling in his first start of the season. The right-hander completed his 23rd double-figure strikeout game, holding the Blue Jays scoreless until the fifth.
Freddy Galvis hit a one-out homer and Randal Grichuk had an RBI double with two away. With the trying run at the plate, Carrasco struck out Rowdy Tellez on his 90th and final pitch.
Jake Bauers' two-run single with the bases loaded was the key hit in the third when Cleveland scored three times. Carlos Santana, Hanley Ramirez and Roberto Perez also drove in runs.
Thomas Pannone (0-2) allowed four runs in 2 2/3 innings, though he also struck out six.
The Indians have won three straight and are 4-1 on their opening homestand. Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield watched from a suite and got the crowd going with a pre-recorded ""Let's Go Tribe"" chant on the video board that was shown midway through the game. The fans later chanted Mayfield's name.
Another big cheer went up when a fan ran onto the field and delayed the game. The fan slowly jogged across the field and was approached by security guards near the left field line. The fan put on a move but fell to the ground and was escorted away.
Toronto has been held to two runs or fewer in seven of 10 games this season, including all three in this series against Cleveland. Trevor Bauer pitched seven hitless innings Thursday and Shane Bieber allowed two runs in six innings Friday.
Santana, whose ninth-inning home run gave Cleveland a 3-2 win Friday, had an RBI single in the first.
Rookie shortstop Eric Stamets doubled leading off the third for his first major league hit. He was 0 for 16 to begin his career. Ramirez drew a bases-loaded walk and Bauers followed with a single.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Blue Jays: 1B Justin Smoak returned after being a late scratch from the lineup Thursday and Friday. He had a first-inning double in five at-bats.
Indians: SS Francisco Lindor continues to do rehab work on his injuries (strained right calf/sprained left ankle). ""He's getting a little friskier every day, which is good,"" manager Terry Francona said. No specific date has been given for Lindor's return.
UP NEXT
Blue Jays RHP Marcus Stroman (0-1, 1.42 ERA) takes the mound in the four-game series finale. Indians RHP Mike Clevinger (0-0, 0.00 ERA) struck out a career-high 12 over seven innings in a no-decision against the Chicago White Sox on April 1.

Virginia 85, Texas Tech 77 | Overtime
By
Billy Witz
MINNEAPOLIS — A year after exiting the court as a picture of embarrassment, the first No. 1 seed to lose to a No. 16 in the men’s N.C.A.A. tournament, Virginia left wearing a crown on Monday night.
The Cavaliers defeated Texas Tech, 85-77, in overtime for the university’s first national basketball championship, which carried with it immeasurable redemption.
“Forget last year,” Virginia’s Ty Jerome said. “This is everything you dream of since you’re a little kid.”
This title game was the first in 40 years between men’s teams that had never been there before. The last one was the showdown in which
Magic Johnson’s Michigan State team beat Larry Bird
and Indiana State in Salt Lake City.
Monday night’s game did not offer anything near that level of star power. Instead, viewers got a matchup of teams that rely on a throwback style of play — methodical offense, lunch-pail defense and rosters long on experience.
With a pair of pulverizing defenses and coaches who demanded diligent shot selection, the game began in sync with expectations — as something that looked like three dribbles and a cloud of sawdust. Five minutes in, that had produced a baseball score: 3-2, in favor of Texas Tech. And it took the Red Raiders more than seven minutes to score their first field goal.
But the game quickly morphed into one for the ages, as the teams traded shot after shot down the stretch and into overtime until the Red Raiders could deliver no more.
“Every time I thought we had it, they made a shot or made a play,” Texas Tech’s Matt Mooney said afterward, barely audible and staring at the ground as he sat at his locker. “It was a battle. We threw a punch, they threw a punch. They came right back at us every time.”
It was fitting that a De’Andre Hunter 3-pointer from the corner, with 2 minutes 10 seconds left in overtime, put the Cavaliers ahead for good, 75-73.
Hunter, who missed last year’s tournament with a broken wrist, carried Virginia at both ends of the court, harassing the Texas Tech star Jarrett Culver into 5-for-22 shooting and shrugging off his own struggles in the first half to finish with a career-high 27 points.
The Cavaliers, who needed some miraculous moments to arrive here — a shot flicked into the basket at the buzzer by Mamadi Diakite to carry them into overtime against Purdue and Kyle Guy’s steel-nerved free throws with six-tenths of a second left to carry them past Auburn in Saturday’s semifinal — got some more on Monday night.
With 14 seconds left in regulation play on Monday, Hunter took a pass from Jerome, who had penetrated into the lane, and knocked down a tying 3-pointer from the corner, in front of the Virginia bench.
It was a particularly crushing shot for Texas Tech.
The Red Raiders had crept back from a 10-point deficit midway through the second half, and they did so without much help from Tariq Owens, the starting forward who sprained his right ankle on Saturday and then received round-the-clock treatment and a painkilling shot to try to get through the title game. Owens played just 22 minutes.
Still, when Norense Odiase sank two free throws with 22 seconds left to put Texas Tech ahead by 68-65, the Red Raiders were right where they wanted to be — turning to their defense, rated by KenPom as the best in the nation.
“I thought we just needed one more stop,” Odiase said. “We pride ourselves on getting stops like that. I thought it was over.”
But as Jerome drove into the lane, Culver left Hunter to help, and Mooney neglected to rotate off Kihei Clark, the freshman guard who is a reluctant shooter.
“I was thinking I have to make this,” said Hunter, who missed seven of eight shots in the first half and scored 22 points in the second. “That’s exactly what I said in my head. I shot it. It felt good. It was on a line. And it went in.”
Texas Tech had been rescued to that point by Brandone Francis, who scored 17 points off the bench, and by some heroic play from Odiase down the stretch. And though Culver came alive offensively late, scoring 15 points and delivering five assists and three blocks, he could not deliver quite enough. He missed two shots in the final seconds of regulation — the first with Hunter contesting — that would have delivered an unlikely title for Texas Tech, which was unranked at the start of the season.
Hunter also had a hand in a pivotal defensive play in overtime, knocking the ball away from Davide Moretti and out of bounds with 1:06 remaining and Virginia clinging to a 75-73 lead. The officials ruled that the ball had gone off Hunter, who raked Moretti across the arm, but the call was overturned after a replay review, and the ball went to Virginia.
Jerome made two foul shots with 41 seconds left, and Virginia, which made all 12 of its free throw attempts in overtime, never gave the ball back to Texas Tech with a chance for it to tie.
To win the championship, Virginia not only had to fend off the determined Red Raiders and win thrillers against Purdue and Auburn. It also had to
beat back ghosts from last year
— when it was stunned by the University of Maryland, Baltimore County — and many questions about whether Coach Tony Bennett’s methodical system was suited to championship basketball.
Bennett, whose father, Dick, took Wisconsin to the Final Four in 2000, had built Virginia into a powerhouse during his 10 years at the university but had advanced beyond the first weekend of the N.C.A.A tournament only twice before this season.
Last season’s disappointment stung like no other.
It lingered below the surface all season for the Cavaliers, who promised that they would be better for the experience.
Guy, a starting guard, has used a photo of himself, bent over with his head in his hands while U.M.B.C. players celebrated around him, as his Twitter avatar for the last year. And when a reporter recently apologized for asking a question about that game, Guy told him it was not necessary.
“If you have a conflict,
try to hit it head on
,” Guy, who scored 24 points, explained on Sunday. “That’s the only way you’re going to get past it, and that’s something that I’ve learned over the years: If you shy away from it, that’s where sometimes your anxiety will come in and haunt you. So I just wanted to hit it head on.”
And so the Cavaliers did, and at the end of their redemptive journey, they learned what it was like to embrace something much more comforting — a gleaming trophy.

(Reuters) - Formula One's 1,000th world championship race will be the Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai this weekend. The following looks at the other milestone races over the years.
-
The first
British Grand Prix, Silverstone. May 13, 1950
The first championship race at the former World War Two airfield was won by Italian Giuseppe 'Nino' Farina in an Alfa Romeo. The Italian marque filled the podium after also sweeping the four-car front row. Ferrari did not participate. The race was attended by 200,000 spectators including King George VI.
-
100
German Grand Prix, Nuerburgring. Aug 6, 1961
Stirling Moss won in a Lotus for the privately-run Rob Walker team, with American Phil Hill on pole for Ferrari. It was the Briton's 16th and last F1 victory, ending a four-race streak of Ferrari wins. In 1962 Moss, four times a championship runner-up, crashed at Goodwood and retired from grand prix racing.
-
200
Monaco Grand Prix, May 23, 1971
Jackie Stewart won from pole for Tyrrell. Swedish great Ronnie Peterson, who died at Monza seven years later, was second for his first Formula One podium finish while Jacky Ickx was third for Ferrari. The race was later immortalised as 'Weekend of a Champion', a documentary by director Roman Polanski.
-
300
South African Grand Prix, Kyalami. March 4, 1978
Peterson was the winner in a black and gold Lotus 78, with reigning champion Niki Lauda on pole for Brabham. American Mario Andretti was to win the championship that year. The race also saw the debut of 1982 world champion Keke Rosberg, father of 2016 champion Nico.
-
400
Austrian Grand Prix, Oesterreichring. Aug 19, 1984
Lauda won his home race for McLaren, despite a late gearbox problem. It was his 23rd win and gave the Austrian the championship lead in a year that was to end with him taking his third title. Lauda's compatriot Gerhard Berger, a future McLaren and Ferrari driver, made his F1 debut with the ATS BMW team.
-
500
Australian Grand Prix, Adelaide. Nov. 4, 1990
Brazilian Ayrton Senna started on pole for McLaren but compatriot Nelson Piquet was the winner for Benetton. The race was overshadowed by the previous grand prix in Japan where Senna had collided with former team mate Alain Prost and won his second title. This race was Nigel Mansell's last for Ferrari.
-
600
Argentine Grand Prix, Buenos Aires. April 13, 1997
Canada's Jacques Villeneuve, to be champion that year with Williams, won from pole after taking victory also in the previous race in Brazil. Ferrari's Eddie Irvine was second and Ralf Schumacher third for Jordan.
-
700
Brazilian Grand Prix, Interlagos. April 6, 2003
A chaotic grand prix, with torrential rain and the race stopped on the 56th of 71 laps due to crashes. McLaren's Kimi Raikkonen was announced as the winner but 10 days later the victory was reassigned to Jordan's Giancarlo Fisichella. The Italian collected his trophy at Imola. The win was Jordan's last, in their 200th start. Fernando Alonso was third but missed the podium because he was getting medical attention.
-
800
Singapore Grand Prix. Sept 28, 2008
The first night race under floodlights turned out to be a dark one after it emerged a year later that Nelson Piquet had crashed deliberately on lap 14 to bring out the safety car and help Renault team mate Alonso win, from 15th on the grid. Ferrari's Felipe Massa, leading from pole, could also feel that this race cost him the title, the Brazilian leaving the pits with the fuel hose still attached and dropping to last. He ended the season losing to McLaren's Lewis Hamilton by a point.
-
900
Bahrain Grand Prix. April 6, 2014
Nico Rosberg started the third race of the season on pole for Mercedes but his team mate Hamilton, who had started alongside, won after taking the lead into the first corner. A late safety car deployment allowed Rosberg to get close to Hamilton again but the Briton stayed ahead.
-
1000
Chinese Grand Prix, Shanghai. April 14, 2019
Who will win the 1,000th race? Mercedes arrive after two one-two finishes from two races, but wary of Ferrari after Charles Leclerc took pole in Bahrain and set the fastest lap.

MINNEAPOLIS — Virginia led Texas Tech 32-29 at halftime of the NCAA national championship game at U.S. Bank Stadium on Monday.
Virginia guard Ty Jerome's triple from the top of the key ended a tug-of-war first half during which the teams combined for 10 3-pointers. The first half featured five ties and four lead changes.
For a stretch of more than six minutes, Texas Tech (31-6) answered every Virginia score
Kyle Guy's 3-pointer knotted the game at 27, answering a jumper from Texas Tech's Brandone Francis. Guy led all scorers with 10 at halftime.
Texas Tech went ahead for the first time with 5:22 left in the half. A pair of Kyler Edwards free throws broke a 21-all tie and Matt Mooney's jumper pushed the lead to four.
Virginia (34-3) looked to have Texas Tech on the ropes early, holding a 17-7 lead, until the Red Raiders dropped in 3s on three trips in a row to awaken the building. The stretch cut the Cavaliers' edge to 19-16 at the under-8 media timeout.
Texas Tech was only 1 of 11 from the floor when Francis started the barrage. Texas Tech got a triple from Edwards 32 seconds later and another from Francis with 8:24 on the clock in the first half.
Texas Tech missed its first nine field goals. Sophomore guard Davide Moretti made a 3-pointer 7:20 into the first half to break the cold snap, but the Red Raiders trailed 9-6.

As the 2018-19 regular season dribbles to a close, with just two nights and 22 of 1,230 games to go, voters leaguewide are finalizing their year-end award ballots in six major categories.
I am no longer one of them, because The New York Times does not permit its reporters to vote for such awards, but it’s still a useful exercise as we take stock of the season to break down each race and who I would have picked.
Official selections are due Friday night and there is simply no wrong answer when choosing between Antetokounmpo and Houston’s James Harden for the top spot on the five-man M.V.P. ballot.
I have always approached this category by trying to identify who had the best overall season — based on a subjective and imprecise mixture of individual and team success — rather than paying attention to the noise about which player is most widely regarded as the game’s best … or the best two-way player … or any other such designation.
So who had the better 2018-19 season? I would go (ever so narrowly) with Giannis. On top of all his individual superlatives, Antetokounmpo has been the face and chief culture-setter in the Bucks’ transformation from 44-win underachiever to the best team in the league (regular-season edition). And his candidacy gets bonus points on our scorecard because Milwaukee, for Eastern Conference supremacy, had to beat out a trio of worthy challengers who were all projected as superior before the season.
Harden would be tremendously unlucky to finish second in M.V.P. balloting for the third time in five seasons, but I think that’s where this is headed. He is going to be the first scoring champion (36.1 points per game) to win the scoring title by more than eight points per game since Michael Jordan did over Dominique Wilkins in 1986-87. And I tend to agree with Houston Coach Mike D’Antoni’s contention that Harden is the only player capable of hauling the injury-riddled Rockets to 53 victories out of the 11-14 hole they were in. Harden simply has the misfortune of doing all that damage in a season that belonged to Antetokounmpo and the Bucks.
It feels as though I have been writing and tweeting about Doncic and his Atlanta Hawks counterpart Trae Young all season. I suspect I will be writing about the two of them for the next decade-plus. And I’m fine with that.
Doncic has had the start-to-finish stronger campaign and continued to look like a franchise player even though the Mavericks steadily increased his Year 1 workload after trading away four-fifths of their starting lineup in February. The trade brought in Kristaps Porzingis and better positions Dallas to build out a supporting cast tailored to their electric European import.
Young has delivered even more impressive post-All-Star break production (24.9 points per game and 9.1 assists per game) for a scrappy Hawks team with a passable record of 23-29 since its dismal 6-23 start — and an increasingly bright future.
Doncic is going to win the race, but Young overcame his own worrisome launch to make it a competition — and a rivalry that should have staying power — with his second-half surge.
Doncic will be remembered as the only rookie in N.B.A. history not named Oscar Robertson to average at least 20 points, 7 rebounds and 5 assists. And Young can take solace in being almost as unfortunate as Harden if he doesn’t win the hardware. It’s quite a compliment when you think about it.
Had the Indiana Pacers won 50 games in a season in which Victor Oladipo was healthy enough to play only 36, Nate McMillan would have the résumé to deny the Bucks’ Budenholzer. I’m not sure McMillan is miles off with 47 wins.
Doc Rivers of the Los Angeles Clippers, like McMillan, is another victim of bad timing. Rivers hasn’t had a team overachieve like these starless Clippers since his rookie season on the bench with Orlando in 1999-2000 when the Magic won a wholly unexpected 41 games in a season billed as a placeholder before a splashy free-agent summer that ultimately landed Grant Hill and Tracy McGrady in the Magic Kingdom.
But Milwaukee’s improvement in Budenholzer’s first season has been so dramatic that I can’t see how he doesn’t win his second Coach of the Year trophy. Perhaps some voters will try to convince themselves that the Bucks would be getting too much love if they vote for both Giannis for M.V.P. and Bud for this honor. But we’re talking about the league’s only 60-win team … and the runaway champions in average point differential for the season (+9.1) … and the only team in the league to rank in the top five in both offensive and defensive efficiency.
Antetokounmpo is the biggest reason all that is possible. General Manager Jon Horst is likewise on an impressive run of roster moves. But Budenholzer’s impact has been undeniable.
Honorable mentions, along with McMillan and Rivers: Denver’s Mike Malone, Brooklyn’s Kenny Atkinson, Portland’s Terry Stotts, Orlando’s Steve Clifford, Detroit’s Dwane Casey, Golden State’s Steve Kerr and, of course, San Antonio’s Gregg Popovich.
Manu Ginobili, who just had his familiar No. 20 retired by the San Antonio Spurs, used to be synonymous with sixth man excellence to me. Ditto for Jamal Crawford.
Yet I’d say Williams wears that crown now.
The Clippers’ designated scorer won this award last season and stands as a huge favorite to join Crawford as the league’s only three-time winner — despite the challenge he’s getting from teammate Montrezl Harrell.
Someone
from the Clippers has to win some year-end recognition in light of the Cinderella season they’ve assembled. Williams makes the most sense over a quality field that also features Harrell, Indiana’s Domantas Sabonis, Brooklyn’s Spencer Dinwiddie, New Orleans’ Julius Randle and San Antonio’s Davis Bertans.
As the self-proclaimed overseer of the All-Lefty Team, it pains me to snub both D’Angelo Russell of the Nets and Sacramento’s De’Aaron Fox in this category.
But I’ve been saying for years that ultra-high former draft picks like Russell and second-year players like Fox are not going to be Most Improved candidates for me. Russell made a tremendous, inspiring leap to All-Star status in Brooklyn this season, but the wow factor partly stems from the fact that he fell so far short of expectations in his first three seasons. Fox, meanwhile, made the sort of Year 1-to-Year 2 leap Sacramento was counting on from someone it billed as a franchise cornerstone.
No one expected Siakam to become an impact player at both ends and a borderline All-Star who helped the Raptors to post 57 wins amid the 22 games Kawhi Leonard missed for various reasons of injury and precaution.
The nostalgic sap in me, truth be told, wanted to go with Minnesota’s resurgent Derrick Rose. But D-Rose only wound up being healthy enough to appear in 51 games — and as a former M.V.P. he’s more of a Comeback Player of the Year than a Most Improved candidate. The N.B.A.’s specific instructions in this category read as follows: “This award is designed to honor an up-and-coming player who has made a dramatic improvement from the previous season or seasons. It is not intended to be given to a player who has made a ‘comeback.’ ”
Siakam, in other words, is perfect. He’s a former No. 27 overall pick who zoomed from role player to foundational player — either beside Leonard or in a post-Kawhi world should Leonard flee Canada in free agency this summer.
Antetokounmpo is a leading candidate here, too, as is Oklahoma City’s Paul George and Indiana’s Myles Turner. But the Bucks, at least on this mythical ballot, will have to settle for two of the six top prizes.
Three would have been too many. Especially since Utah’s Gobert remains such a dominant deterrent at the rim in his role as the anchor for a defense that officially ranks No. 2 but is essentially on par with Milwaukee’s.

You ask; I answer. Every week in this space, I’ll field three questions posed via email at
marcstein-newsletter@nytimes.com
. (Please include your first and last name, as well as the city you’re writing in from, and make sure the subject line reads “Corner Three.”)
Q:
Deandre Ayton hasn’t had a terrible rookie year, but it has paled in comparison to what we’ve seen from Luka Doncic and Trae Young. What do you think Ayton needs to improve on — and will he ever match Luka or Trae’s potential? — Henry Roth (Scottsdale, Ariz.)
STEIN:
It speaks to how far the Suns have faded from prominence that Ayton, as the No. 1 overall pick last June, got so little attention given the numbers he posted (16.3 points and 10.3 rebounds per game).
The leaguewide fascination with Doncic and Young is also a factor, as you mentioned, but Ayton was overlooked in the extreme this season. Suns fans should be hoping that the snub helps motivate Ayton in Year 2, because consistency and sustained energy have been issues for him so far.
From a technical standpoint, Ayton has to develop into more of a rim protector. With his mobility and athleticism, Phoenix should be able to build a defense around him. He’s not close to elite yet at that end.
But it would also be unfair to ignore that Ayton was frequently forced to start alongside two other rookies on a squad that still doesn’t have a starter-level N.B.A. point guard.
Q:
Dirk Nowitzki hasn’t come out and said he is retiring, but everyone else seems to be saying it. At first I didn’t believe Adam Silver would have put Dirk in the All-Star Game if he didn’t have it on good authority that Dirk would soon retire, but could this actually not be his final year? It looks like Dirk’s ankle has finally recovered from surgery and he’s moving a lot better. Why not play one more season with Luka Doncic and Kristaps Porzingis and try to go out with a playoff berth? — Sharad Acharya
STEIN:
This much I can tell you: Dirk joining Dwyane Wade in the All-Star Game as a so-called “commissioner’s pick” has nothing to do with Nowitzki’s retirement plans. As Dirk stated before, during and after his trip to Charlotte, this was his All-Star swan song no matter what, even if he decided to play next season.
I think there have been times since the All-Star break when an encouraged Nowitzki has imagined himself carrying on. He’s been a huge Porzingis fan for years and would naturally love to experience the Doncic/Porzingis tandem. But the reality is that season No. 21 has been a bigger challenge physically than he ever imagined.
Is it really worth putting his body through the rigors of yet another nine-month ride? The case against coming back is much stronger than the case for it, which is why you’ve heard the likes of Mark Cuban and Steve Nash give interviews in recent days that make it sound as though the end is near.
Q:
I’d like to hear your thoughts on how Stephen Curry makes everyone else on the floor better and how that may not necessarily be the case with Kevin Durant? — Michael Dortheimer
STEIN:
Anyone who believes this must not have watched the last two N.B.A. finals.
Steph is Golden State’s No. 1 playmaker and a true revolutionary when it comes to the way his seemingly limitless shooting range bends defenses.
But there’s a reason Durant has won back-to-back M.V.P. trophies in the finals. He’s the best finisher in the game and was the best player on the floor on the game’s grandest stage two years in a row.
The Warriors are 32-6 in the playoffs since Durant arrived. Who would dare say he doesn’t make all of the other Warriors better just by being out there?
Curry has the ball in his hands more, which surely fuels the perception you describe, but Durant commands more double teams than any other Warrior and is a great passer both out of the post and in pick-and-roll situations. There is no shortage of coaches and scouts around the league who regard him as an elite playmaker.
This is the fifth time in the Knicks’ 73-season history that they’ve had the league’s worst record. The first three times, there were fewer than 10 teams in the league: 1960-61 (21-58 in an eight-team league), 1962-63 (21-59 in a nine-team league) and 1964-65 (22-58 in a nine-team league). The Knicks were also at the bottom of a 23-team league in 1985-86 at 23-59.
At 16-64 so far this season, the Knicks will post the lowest win total in franchise history unless they win at least one of their final two games.
Utah’s Rudy Gobert is poised to finish this season
with more dunks than anyone else
, with 301 dunks to Antetokounmpo’s 279 for Milwaukee. Gobert, though, has played in all 80 of Utah’s games this season. Antetokounmpo has missed 12 of the Bucks’ 81 games to date.
Antetokounmpo’s Bucks finished 18th in defensive rating last season. They’ve climbed 17 spots this season to rank No. 1 overall entering Tuesday’s play, allowing 104.8 points per 100 possessions.
Jason Terry’s 590 regular-season games alongside Dirk are the most of any teammate in Nowitzki’s 21 seasons in Dallas. J.J. Barea ranks second (and No. 1 among active Mavericks) with 543 regular-season games. The Mavericks say Nowitzki has had 197 teammates.
This is the 39th consecutive season, according to the peerless data maintained by
Basketball-Reference.com
, during which the average height of N.B.A. players is 6-foot-7. The last season that featured a different figure was 1979-80, when the average height of N.B.A. players was 6-foot-6.

MANCHESTER, England — The following are talking points from the weekend's Premier League and FA Cup action:
QUADRUPLE NOT ""IMPOSSIBLE"" FOR CITY
Manchester City remain in real contention for an unprecedented quadruple of trophies but their manager Pep Guardiola said the chance of them achieving that feat is ""almost impossible"".
The closest any English club has come to winning all four trophies in a season was Manchester United when they won the Treble - the Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup - in 1998-99.
City have already won the League Cup (Carabao Cup) and are in the final of the FA Cup, the quarter-finals of the Champions League and are two points behind Liverpool in the Premier League with a game in hand.
The quadruple would be an incredible achievement but it is surely not as far-fetched as Guardiola is suggesting.
The Spaniard's team will start as strong favourites against Watford in the FA Cup final. They will also expect to beat Tottenham Hotspur over two-legs to reach the last four of the Champions League and, while there are six games to go, they have the destiny of the Premier League title in their own hands.
SIGNS OF LIFE IN FA CUP AFTER WATFORD WIN
There is no doubt that the FA Cup is no longer the competition it once was, with the dominance of the Premier League and Champions League pushing the domestic knockout competition well down the list of priorities for clubs.
But Watford's exhilarating 3-2 extra-time comeback win over Wolverhampton Wanderers at Wembley on Sunday was a sign that, at least in the latter stages, the Cup can still deliver drama and excitement.
It helped that both teams have little at stake in the league -- neither are in relegation trouble and while both are in contention for Europa League places, that wasn't temptation enough for either manager to field weakened sides.
That really is the problem with the FA Cup - too many teams treat the competition as a chance for their back-up and fringe players to get a game.
Sunday was the perfect storm -- two closely-matched teams who have had good seasons and who would be delighted with a trophy, going all out for victory.
What a pity that is so rare.
LIVERPOOL DON'T LOOK LIKE 'BOTTLERS'
The weight of expectation on Liverpool to deliver their first top flight league title since 1990 coupled with the memory of their collapse in 2014, has led to a narrative around whether Juergen Klopp's side have the mental strength to go all the way.
Friday's away game at relegation-threatened Southampton stood at 1-1 with ten minutes to go -- exactly the kind of situation where panic might set in.
But goals from Mohamed Salah and Jordan Henderson gave the Reds a 3-1 win which returned them to the top of the table.
Given Klopp's side have lost just once in 33 Premier League games this season it is quite odd that some still wonder if they have the strength of character to finish the season strongly.
DON'T RULE CARDIFF OUT JUST YET
With Huddersfield Town and Fulham already down, the final relegation slot is currently occupied by Cardiff City who are five points adrift of the safety zone.
Southampton, Brighton & Hove Albion, Newcastle United and Burnley are all still looking down nervously wondering if Neil Warnock's side are capable of a late season rally.
Cardiff are at Burnley on Saturday in what has long looked like a crunch game, although the Clarets have moved up to 14th thanks to wins over Wolves and Bournemouth.
But if the South Wales side can get three points at Turf Moor, they could ensure a nervy end to the season for their rivals.
DRAMA TO COME IN PROMOTION RACE
Norwich City have a seven point lead at the top of the second-tier Championship but expect a real battle for the other two promotion slots.
With six games to go, Yorkshire rivals Sheffield United and Leeds United are scrapping for the second automatic promotion spot while familiar names West Bromwich Albion and Aston Villa look set for playoff places.

(Reuters) - Formula One's 1,000th world championship race will be the Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai this weekend. The following looks at the other milestone races over the years.
-
The first
British Grand Prix, Silverstone. May 13, 1950
The first championship race at the former World War Two airfield was won by Italian Giuseppe 'Nino' Farina in an Alfa Romeo. The Italian marque filled the podium after also sweeping the four-car front row. Ferrari did not participate. The race was attended by 200,000 spectators including King George VI.
-
100
German Grand Prix, Nuerburgring. Aug 6, 1961
Stirling Moss won in a Lotus for the privately-run Rob Walker team, with American Phil Hill on pole for Ferrari. It was the Briton's 16th and last F1 victory, ending a four-race streak of Ferrari wins. In 1962 Moss, four times a championship runner-up, crashed at Goodwood and retired from grand prix racing.
-
200
Monaco Grand Prix, May 23, 1971
Jackie Stewart won from pole for Tyrrell. Swedish great Ronnie Peterson, who died at Monza seven years later, was second for his first Formula One podium finish while Jacky Ickx was third for Ferrari. The race was later immortalised as 'Weekend of a Champion', a documentary by director Roman Polanski.
-
300
South African Grand Prix, Kyalami. March 4, 1978
Peterson was the winner in a black and gold Lotus 78, with reigning champion Niki Lauda on pole for Brabham. American Mario Andretti was to win the championship that year. The race also saw the debut of 1982 world champion Keke Rosberg, father of 2016 champion Nico.
-
400
Austrian Grand Prix, Oesterreichring. Aug 19, 1984
Lauda won his home race for McLaren, despite a late gearbox problem. It was his 23rd win and gave the Austrian the championship lead in a year that was to end with him taking his third title. Lauda's compatriot Gerhard Berger, a future McLaren and Ferrari driver, made his F1 debut with the ATS BMW team.
-
500
Australian Grand Prix, Adelaide. Nov. 4, 1990
Brazilian Ayrton Senna started on pole for McLaren but compatriot Nelson Piquet was the winner for Benetton. The race was overshadowed by the previous grand prix in Japan where Senna had collided with former team mate Alain Prost and won his second title. This race was Nigel Mansell's last for Ferrari.
-
600
Argentine Grand Prix, Buenos Aires. April 13, 1997
Canada's Jacques Villeneuve, to be champion that year with Williams, won from pole after taking victory also in the previous race in Brazil. Ferrari's Eddie Irvine was second and Ralf Schumacher third for Jordan.
-
700
Brazilian Grand Prix, Interlagos. April 6, 2003
A chaotic grand prix, with torrential rain and the race stopped on the 56th of 71 laps due to crashes. McLaren's Kimi Raikkonen was announced as the winner but 10 days later the victory was reassigned to Jordan's Giancarlo Fisichella. The Italian collected his trophy at Imola. The win was Jordan's last, in their 200th start. Fernando Alonso was third but missed the podium because he was getting medical attention.
-
800
Singapore Grand Prix. Sept 28, 2008
The first night race under floodlights turned out to be a dark one after it emerged a year later that Nelson Piquet had crashed deliberately on lap 14 to bring out the safety car and help Renault team mate Alonso win, from 15th on the grid. Ferrari's Felipe Massa, leading from pole, could also feel that this race cost him the title, the Brazilian leaving the pits with the fuel hose still attached and dropping to last. He ended the season losing to McLaren's Lewis Hamilton by a point.
-
900
Bahrain Grand Prix. April 6, 2014
Nico Rosberg started the third race of the season on pole for Mercedes but his team mate Hamilton, who had started alongside, won after taking the lead into the first corner. A late safety car deployment allowed Rosberg to get close to Hamilton again but the Briton stayed ahead.
-
1000
Chinese Grand Prix, Shanghai. April 14, 2019
Who will win the 1,000th race? Mercedes arrive after two one-two finishes from two races, but wary of Ferrari after Charles Leclerc took pole in Bahrain and set the fastest lap.

AUGUSTA Ga. (Reuters) - Rory McIlroy will begin his latest quest to complete the career grand slam of golf's four majors when he tees off alongside American Rickie Fowler and Australia's Cameron Smith at the Masters starting on Thursday at Augusta National.
It will be McIlroy's fifth attempt at the Masters to complete his collection of major titles and is perhaps his best chance yet as the Northern Irishman enters the week as the hottest player on the planet.
McIlroy's grouping, which will be the 15th of 29 to take the course, will start their round at 11:15 a.m. ET (1515 GMT) and follow the threesome of four-times champion Tiger Woods, China's Li Haotong and Spaniard Jon Rahm around the course.
Looking to join Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Woods as winners of the career grand slam, McIlroy enters the year's first major in top form.
With a top-six finish in each of the six stroke play events he has played this year, including a triumph at The Players Championship three weeks ago, McIlroy is a popular pick to make amends for his final-round letdown last year.
McIlroy, whose grouping will be the last out on Friday at 2 p.m. ET behind the Woods threesome, started three shots back of eventual champion Patrick Reed entering the final round in 2018 but closed with two-over 74 to finish in a share of fifth place.
Three-times champion Phil Mickelson will play the opening two rounds alongside 2013 U.S. Open champion Justin Rose and 2017 PGA Championship winner Justin Thomas in the penultimate grouping on Thursday.
The final trio on Thursday will bring together Jordan Spieth, Paul Casey and Brooks Koepka.
World number two Dustin Johnson will play the opening two rounds with Bryson DeChambeau and Australian Jason Day while reigning champion Patrick Reed will play alongside fellow American Webb Simpson and Norwegian amateur Viktor Hovland.

Defenseman Slava Voynov has been suspended for the 2019-20 season due to ""unacceptable off-ice conduct,"" the NHL announced Tuesday.
Voynov, 29, recently applied for reinstatement to the NHL. He was indefinitely suspended in October 2014 after being arrested following an altercation with his wife.
Police responded to Voynov's house in Redondo Beach, Calif., and said he punched, kicked and choked his wife. Voynov, who was a member of the Los Angeles Kings at the time, entered a no-contest plea in July 2015.
Last July, a conviction in that case was dismissed by a Los Angeles judge.
Tuesday's decision came after the league investigated the situation, including an in-person meeting with Voynov last month in New York.
""Today's ruling, while tailored to the specific facts of this case and the individuals involved, is necessary and consistent with the NHL's strongly-held policy that it cannot and will not tolerate this and similar types of conduct, particularly as directed at a spouse, domestic partner or family member,"" NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said in a statement.
The NHL Players Association will review the decision. It could appeal to an independent arbitrator.
The Kings terminated Voynov's six-year, $25 million contract after his arrest and placed him on their voluntary retired list.
Voynov has since played for a Russian team and was a member of that country's 2018 gold medal-winning Olympic team.
Voynov had 18 goals and 63 assists in 190 NHL games with the Kings from 2011-14.
The NHL says that with ""good behavior,"" Voynov will be eligible to sign with an NHL team on July 1, 2020.

NEW ORLEANS — Warriors guard Stephen Curry left Tuesday night's game against the Pelicans with what team officials say is a mild sprain of his right foot.
The club says Curry was ruled out for the remainder of the game for precautionary reasons.
Curry played nine minutes during the first quarter, scoring five points. When he subbed out of the game with less than three minutes remaining in the period, he walked past the bench and straight down the tunnel leading to the locker room.
Curry joined several other Warriors stars who already had been ruled out before the game, including Kevin Durant with the flu, Klay Thompson with right knee soreness, Andre Iguodala with a sore toe on his left foot and Andrew Bogut for rest.
The Warriors already have clinched the top playoff seed in the Western Conference and wrap up their regular season at Memphis on Wednesday night.

“So many of us can relate to playing by rules that were never set up for us to win.

Abby Wambach
, two-time Olympic gold medalist and World Cup champion
Abby Wambach has made a career out of pursuing goals. She’s scored 184 of them after all, the most by any soccer player, male or female, in international soccer history. But now, a few years into her retirement, Wambach, who led the United States women’s team to a World Cup championship in 2015, is focused on a new kind of goal: motivating women to become leaders.
“There has never been a more important, urgent time than right now for women to begin to fully lead our own lives,” she told me this week.
In her new book, “Wolfpack,” Wambach, 38, shares lessons she learned from decades of training, failure and triumph on the field. It is based on the
commencement speech
she gave at Barnard College in New York last year that quickly went viral. “If I could go back and tell my younger self one thing, it would be this: ‘Abby, you were never Little Red Riding Hood; you were always the wolf,’” she told graduates.
[FROM THE ARCHIVES:
Abby Wambach, Retired U.S. Soccer Star, Reflects on Her Addiction
]
Her book’s release comes a month after the United States women’s team filed a
gender discrimination lawsuit
against the United States Soccer Federation. While Wambach is not part of the suit, she’s been outspoken on the subject. “This isn’t just a female athlete’s story; this is every single woman’s story on planet Earth,”
she said in September
. “Women lose our very lives because of this pay gap inequity, and in order to get it back we have to fight.”
In “Wolfpack,” Wambach offers eight new rules to help women succeed professionally and personally
.
And she hopes her ideas trigger a domino effect. “When one person stands up and demands the ball, the job, the promotion, the paycheck, the microphone, that one gives others permission to do the same,” she said.
Here are the four of her “new rules,” and the norms she hopes they’ll upend.
______
“Champion each other.”
Old Rule: Be against each other.
New Rule: Be FOR each other.
“Power and success and joy are not pies,” Wambach writes. “A bigger slice for one woman doesn’t mean a smaller slice for another.”
______
“Be grateful
and
ambitious.”
Old Rule: Be grateful for what you have.
New Rule: Be grateful for what you have AND demand what you deserve.
“I was so grateful for a paycheck, so grateful to represent my country, so grateful to be the token woman at the table, so grateful to receive any respect at all that I was afraid to use my voice to demand more,” Wambach writes. “Our gratitude is how power uses the tokenism of a few women to keep the rest of us in line.”
______
“Make failure your fuel.”
Old Rule: Failure means you’re out of the game.
New Rule: Failure means you’re finally IN the game.
“Imperfect men have been empowered and permitted to run the world since the beginning of time,” Wambach writes. “It’s time for imperfect women to grant themselves permission to join them.”
______
“Lead from the bench.”
Old Rule: Wait for permission to lead.
New Rule: Lead now — from wherever you are.
“The picture of leadership is not just a man at the head of a table,” Wambach writes. “It’s also every woman who is allowing her own voice to guide her life and the lives of those she cares about.”

What would happen if women gained the same physical strength as men? That was the question posed in an
1870 article
in The New York Times titled “Muscular Women” (!).
The answer, according to the opponents of equal rights at the time, would be a disruption of the natural order of things, meaning women would exert their strength to take down men physically and mentally.
Should women continue to get fit, they “must expect no favorite and no mercy,” according to the article, because chivalry works only if women are weaker.
“If this sort of thing goes on,” the article said, “it’s hard to say what will become of the men.”

HOUSTON —
In a young season already defined by injuries
, the Yankees have sent their best pitcher for further tests on his throwing shoulder after his rehabilitation efforts stalled.
Luis Severino, 25, the staff ace, has not been able to throw off a mound as he tries to recover from rotator cuff inflammation in his right shoulder.
After he did long tosses on flat ground at the team’s spring training facility in Tampa, Fla., over the weekend, Severino “didn’t feel as great” as he had after recent tosses, Yankees Manager Aaron Boone said Monday night, before the team’s 4-3 loss to the Houston Astros.
Severino was sent to New York to be evaluated by Christopher Ahmad, the team’s head doctor. Boone said Severino was expected to have a magnetic resonance imaging examination on Tuesday, and perhaps other tests.
Boone said Severino’s shoulder felt “O.K., but just not where he wants to be.” And the Yankees (5-5) are unsure why the pitcher’s shoulder hasn’t felt ready for him to get on a mound, the next step in the throwing program. Severino last threw from 130 feet on flat ground.
“I’m hoping it’s just him not able to get over the hump quite yet,” Boone said.
“The original testing that we did with him led us to be pretty confident,” he added. “But we’ve got to make sure he’s right. The fact that he hasn’t graduated from the flat ground throwing yet to the mound, we’ve got to try and answer those questions as best we can.”
Severino is one of the Yankees’ major-league-leading
11 players on the injured list
. The Yankees have nearly $87 million in 2019 salaries on the I.L., which includes stars like outfielder Giancarlo Stanton and reliever Dellin Betances and standouts such as outfielder Aaron Hicks and starter pitcher C. C. Sabathia, who is expected to return this weekend.
Before this, Severino had not been on the I.L. since May 2016, when he had a strained right triceps.
Severino has been out since March 5, when he was scratched from his first spring training start because of discomfort in his throwing shoulder. An M.R.I. exam then revealed only rotator cuff inflammation, according to the Yankees, and Severino received a prescription for an injection, anti-inflammatory medication and rest.
In order to complete a four-year $40 million contract extension in February, Severino passed a physical, which included an M.R.I. exam.
Severino originally was not
expected back from the injury until sometime in May
. Until the latest tests are done, it will be unclear whether that estimate will change.
The Yankees can ill afford to lose Severino, a two-time All-Star and one of the best starters in the American League, for a significant period of time. But the rotation has managed without him so far.
With solid pitching from Masahiro Tanaka and James Paxton, plus the fill-ins Domingo German and Jonathan Loaisiga, the Yankees’ rotation entered Monday with a 3.09 earned run average, ranking eighth in the majors.
Tanaka fired six strong innings on Monday, allowing one run on a homer by Houston’s Jose Altuve. The Yankees took a 3-1 lead into the seventh inning, partly because of a solo homer that Aaron Judge hit off Justin Verlander in the fifth.
But relievers Zack Britton and Adam Ottavino, neither of whom had been scored upon this season, allowed a combined three runs. A cueball infield single by Carlos Correa that went between Ottavino and first baseman Greg Bird in the eighth inning brought Alex Bregman home, giving the Astros the winning margin.
“He couldn’t bunt it better than that,” Bird said.

MINNEAPOLIS — Jarrett Culver knew Texas Tech desperately needed him to make a big leap after a solid freshman year so he charged full-speed into an offseason determined to refine and expand every element of his game.
De'Andre Hunter needed a little longer to do the same at Virginia, even by spending a year as a redshirt watching from the sidelines.
Yet here they are in Minneapolis, a pair of players who have blossomed into bonafide NBA prospects for teams a win away from becoming a first-time national champion. Consider it proof — or maybe simply a needed reminder — that college players can still take a slightly longer path to becoming top-tier NBA prospects amid the college game's starry-eyed infatuation with one-and-done talents.
""You can do that,"" Culver said Sunday, the day before his Red Raiders meet Hunter's Cavaliers in the national-title game. ""The one-and-dones, they're very talented guys coming out of high school and they get looked at a lot. My route was just a little different. I don't know how long I'll be in college. I just know if you put the work in and set your goals, you can do whatever you set your mind to.""
Look, no one is going to confuse Culver and Hunter for flashier players with tantalizing upside like Duke's Zion Williamson this season or Arizona's Deandre Ayton a year earlier. Yet Culver, a 6-foot-5 sophomore, is the undisputed first (maybe second and third, as well) offensive option with enough versatility to lead the defensively inclined Red Raiders in scoring, rebounding and assists.
As for Hunter, the 6-7 redshirt sophomore has developed into a more assertive scorer with 3-point range. Yet it's his defensive versatility that stands out with his ability to defend inside or out — he even checked talented North Carolina freshman point guard Coby White late in a February road win — as the Division I defensive player of the year for the National Association of Basketball Coaches.
Check any mock draft, and their names are easy to find. Both are frequently listed among the top 10 picks if they entered the NBA draft after the season ends. And it's likely they'll be matched up against each other at least during some during Monday night's championship game.
""They'll both be (high) if they both come out, but this is not a great year for the draft,"" ESPN analyst Jay Bilas said. ""You've obviously got the super talent in the top five, the top four. But who knows where they'd go in another year? I think they're first-round talents in most any year.
""That's what's going to cause a number of players to come out this year: they want to go higher, they would go higher this year than perhaps in another one. Not these two, these two are legit.""
That's not to say either has been flawless in the NCAA Tournament.
Culver averaged 21.5 points through the four-game push through the West Region, but was quiet nearly all Saturday night before scoring seven of his 10 points in the final three minutes to help Texas Tech hold off Michigan State's rally.
As for Hunter, he had a rough two-game set in the regionals by making just 8 of 23 shots (34.7 followed by an ineffective first half in Saturday's first national semifinal against Auburn before playing far more assertively after the break.
""I think he's hard on himself,"" Virginia coach Tony Bennett said. ""If he's missing shots or not helping his team, he puts a lot on himself. We talked about it: 'Be free, man. Go after this. We need you.'""
Consider it the next phase of Hunter's growth as a player.
""I just try to live up to my my own expectations,"" Hunter said. ""I know how hard I work, I know the things I do every day. It gets kind of frustrating at times but I just try to get back to doing what I do and playing the game free.""
When asked, both players point to the other's ability to affect the game at both ends of the court. Their descriptions could have easily applied to themselves.
Fitting, considering they've taken a similar route to what they hope is a net-cutting finish on the way to the NBA.
""What it says is that players mature at different rates,"" Bilas said. ""Some players are ready when they're freshmen, there are some players that stay in school four years because they want to, some stay three because they want to. There's no one set path to anything, including basketball.""

DUBLIN — Ireland's state-funded sport coordination body suspended future funding to the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) on Tuesday after the football body acknowledged that it failed to comply with its grant approval terms.
Sport Ireland, which has been demanding answers from the FAI over a 100,000 euro (£86,451) short-term loan provided to it by former chief executive John Delaney, said the acknowledgement was made in a written statement the FAI was due to deliver to a parliamentary committee on Wednesday.
Delaney, who was moved to a new role of executive vice-president at the FAI shortly after details of the loan were first reported, is due to appear before the committee with other officials on Wednesday to answer questions over a story that has made frontpage news in Ireland in the last month.
In the FAI's statement to the committee, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, chairman Donal Conway said circumstances arose in April 2017 -- when it received the loan -- that were not related to Sport Ireland in line with grant approval conditions.
The FAI said last month that the loan was needed due to short-term cash flow issues and that it was repaid in full two months later.
Sport Ireland, however, said it was never notified about any deterioration in finances, as the FAI would have been obliged to do.
""The Board of Sport Ireland will consider the reinstatement of funding once all ongoing reports commissioned by the FAI have been completed and the recommendations adopted,"" it said in a statement, referring to reviews the FAI has commissioned from audit firm Mazars and accountant Grant Thornton.
The FAI, which generated a retained surplus of 2.8 million euros on revenues of 49 million in 2017, its last set of published reports, receives annual funding of 2.7 million euros from the state. It has already drawn down half of it for 2019.
The FAI said it was unfortunate Sport Ireland felt compelled to suspend the funding, which was crucial to the development of Irish soccer.
""The Association is keen to restore trust and confidence and rebuild the relationship with Sport Ireland as soon as possible,"" FAI chairman Conway said in a statement.
Lawmakers due to quiz the FAI on Wednesday welcomed the suspension and said they would also seek answers about the decision to move Delaney to another position in the association.
""It's a damning indictment that such shoddy financial and corporate governance practices were permitted. Hopefully this is the start of a real change,"" Noel Rock, a member of the governing Fine Gael party, said on Twitter.

(Reuters) - The Rugby Football Union (RFU) on Tuesday banned Sale Sharks prop Jake Pope for six months following a second violation of their Illicit Drugs Programme.
The RFU said Pope was the first player to have breached the policy for a second time after a drug test in November returned an adverse analytical finding for cannabis and cocaine.
He admitted the violation at an independent disciplinary panel hearing in February, and the ban has been backdated to the day of his provisional suspension on Dec. 4, paving the way for a return in June.
Pope previously admitted a first violation following a test in 2017 and was fined 1,000 pounds although the RFU did not make their finding public as it was a first-time offence.
""The purpose of the Illicit Drugs Policy is primarily to protect the health and welfare of players,"" RFU's Anti-Doping and Illicit Drugs Programme manager Stephen Watkins said in a statement on the governing body's website.
""This is the first time we have had a second offence since the policy was established in 2010. It should send a strong deterrent message to all players that the RFU takes the misuse of substances seriously.""
Sale described Pope's behaviour as ""unacceptable"" but offered their support.
""The club does not condone the misuse of drugs from any player and accept the decision made by the RFU,"" the Premiership club said in a statement on their website.

AUGUSTA, Ga. — The first time Francesco Molinari arrived at The Masters, he was in white overalls. This year, the British Open champion is hoping to walk away in a green jacket.
A caddie for his brother Edoardo in 2006, Molinari ""carried the clubs and prayed that (Edoardo) was going to hit good shots,"" the Italian told reporters on Tuesday.
""We were very inexperienced at this level and just trying to make the most of those two days.""
This year, the 36-year-old will hit the links as the Open Championship's victor and a legitimate threat to take The Masters' top prize.
""I've had a lot of success in the last few months, and I think that the important thing is that I don't have to let my guard down,"" Molinari said.
""I still have to go through all the work and the process that got me to this point, and hopefully will get me even further forward in my career.""
The world number seven has enjoyed a hot streak since becoming the first Italian professional golfer to win a major at the British Open in July, clinching the Ryder cup for Europe in September and winning the race to Dubai in November.
Most recently, the European Tour Golfer of the Year put on a putting master class to win March's Arnold Palmer Invitational.
""It's taken awhile, but obviously now success is coming quite often, and that's a nice feeling,"" Molinari said. ""So I'll try to keep working to keep the success coming.""
To do so this week he'll need to contend with Augusta National's famously challenging course, where his career best saw him tie for 19th in 2012.
Alongside his competitors, he'll also grapple with a new fifth hole on the course.
""The second shot, obviously is longer, considerably longer,"" said Molinari, who practiced on the front nine on Monday. ""I think that's going to be around a three‑club difference.""

(Reuters) - Rugby internationals from two codes, Australian Valentine Holmes and England's Christian Wade, have been added to the practice squads of the New York Jets and Buffalo Bills as part of the NFL's international player pathway program.
Australian rugby league international Holmes, a prolific try-scorer for the Cronulla Sharks, ripped up his contract with his club at the end of last season to pursue his dream of playing in the NFL.
The 23-year-old has been listed as a running back/wide receiver/kick returner and will be hoping to follow in the footsteps of compatriot Jarryd Hayne, who suited up in eight regular season games for the San Francisco 49ers in 2015.
The pacy 27-year-old Wade played one rugby union international on the wing for England in 2013 after building a reputation as one of the best finishers in the game. He is projected to play at running back, the Bills said.
Both players will be the 11th man on their teams' practice squads, and 91st on the roster overall, and be retained at least through to the end of their pre-season training camps.
Four AFC teams will carry an extra player on their squads this year under the program, which aims to provide hopefuls from around the world to ""compete at NFL level, improve their skills, and ultimately earn a spot on an NFL roster"".
The Miami Dolphins have taken on Brazilian defensive tackle Durval Neto, while German tight end Jakob Johnson, who played at the University of Tennessee, joins the New England Patriots.

The foot injury that cost John Wall half of this season might sideline the Washington Wizards point guard for all of next season, too.
The five-time All-Star, speaking to reporters Tuesday during the Wizards' season finale, expressed uncertainty regarding the timetable for his recovery. Wall hasn't played since Dec. 26, and he underwent surgery in February to repair his left Achilles tendon.
""Whenever my body feels like it's back to where I feel ready to play, that's when I'll come back,"" Wall said, according to the Washington Post. ""I think I've been through the process of plenty of injuries and just coming back before I was supposed to and injuring myself and making it a lot worse. So, this is one, just take my time and let my whole body heal and get back to being 100 percent.""
Wall, 28, appeared in 32 games this season, and he averaged 20.7 points (the second-highest mark of his career), 8.7 assists and 3.6 rebounds.
Asked his thoughts on the possibility the Wizards could select a point guard in this year's draft, Wall said, according to the Post, ""I'd be fine. I don't have no problem with that because it is what it is. You have to do what's best for the team and make sure that we have pieces. And when I come back, he can be a great backup to me.""
He said of his aim for the offseason: ""Just getting the motion back in my foot, just being able to walk on two shoes. That's what I'm really waiting to get to. Then after that, it's just everything is taking my time and going with the process. That's how long it takes.""
Wall still has four years and $170 million left on his contract.

Dirk Nowitzki was mum all season on his future plans but after a rousing performance in the Dallas Mavericks' home finale Tuesday, the star finally announced the decision everyone expected.
""Wow. I'm a little overwhelmed, as you would think,"" Nowitzki told the sellout crowd after the Mavericks' 120-109 victory over the Phoenix Suns. ""As you guys might expect, this is my last home game.""
Nowitzki made his much-anticipated retirement announcement after delivering a season-high 30-point performance, with five 3-pointers, against the Suns. The 7-footer scored 10 points in the opening seven minutes and had 19 points on a season-high 18 shot attempts in the first half.
The 14-time All-Star and sixth-leading scorer in NBA history (31,540 points) finished the game with eight rebounds, three assists and a block in a season-high 33 minutes.
The 40-year-old Nowitzki, whose playing career will officially end Wednesday night when the Mavs play the San Antonio Spurs, was honored by the appearance of five of his childhood heroes -- Charles Barkley, Larry Bird, Scottie Pippen, Shawn Kemp and fellow German Detlef Schrempf -- for a postgame ceremony that included heartfelt speeches by Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle and owner Mark Cuban.
""Amazing that my heroes came out here for this game,"" Nowitzki said. ""Thank you guys so much. Love you guys. Grew up watching you and idolizing you guys so this means more than you will ever know.
""Mark, can't wait to see what you've got for my jersey retirement. I mean, this is a high bar that you set. But as you guys might expect, this is my last home game.""
Nowitzki's final season didn't actually begin until mid-December thanks to a longer-than-expected recovery from ankle surgery. From there, he mostly came off the bench for the first time in his career and averaged 6.6 points in fewer than 15 minutes a game.
But on this special night, Nowitzki turned back the clock, and so did the crowd as it chanted M-V-P! M-V-P! Nowitzki won the league's regular-season MVP award in 2007 and earned NBA Finals MVP in 2011, when he delivered Dallas its lone championship.

MUMBAI — India's Manpreet Kaur, who won women's shot put gold at the 2017 Asian athletics championships, has received a four-year ban after testing positive for banned substances, the country's anti-doping body (NADA) has said.
Kaur failed doping tests four times in 2017, the body said, including at the Asian championships in Bhubaneswar, where she won with a throw of 18.28m, and in the first leg of the Asian grand prix in China, where her winning throw of 18.86m was a national record.
NADA had formed a disciplinary panel to hear the case and handed down the ban, which was backdated to July 2017 when the 29-year-old was provisionally suspended.
Kaur, who can appeal the sanction, will lose her gold medals from both meets, NADA Director General Navin Agarwal said.

(Reuters) - Manager Phil Neville said he deliberately disrupted the rhythm of his England women's team with a double substitution in Tuesday's 2-1 friendly international win over Spain to test his players' defensive resolve ahead of the World Cup.
England were leading 2-0 after goals from Beth Mead and Ellen White when Neville replaced midfielder Jade Moore and forward Toni Duggan, who have more than 100 international caps between them, early in the second half.
He sent on the inexperienced duo of Lucy Staniforth and Chioma Ubogagu, handing the initiative back to Spain, who pulled a goal back through Aitana Bonmati 13 minutes after the changes were made.
""I made two substitutions because I wanted the team to suffer, I wanted to see what we were like with them charging at us,"" Neville told reporters.
""I knew the substitutions would break the rhythm of our team but I wanted to show how our back four would cope, how our goalkeeper would show up and the midfield players would dig in.""
England hung on for the win and Neville said the plan to force his players out of their comfort zone had worked but highlighted the need for the team to show more composure.
""My players were stretched and it was quite fun watching them outside of their comfort zone, shattered and running from side to side,"" he said. ""It was a really good workout that went exactly how I wanted it to.
""For us to do well at a World Cup, there are games when we have to dig in and block shots. That's what I wanted to see and I just said to them that I thought they could have done it better, the next step is to dig in but show composure as well.""
England have warm-up games against Denmark and New Zealand before kicking off their World Cup Group D campaign against Scotland in Nice on June 9. Argentina and Japan are the other teams in the group.

Patrick Reed has been waiting for his meal for a long time — 15 years to be exact.
On Tuesday, Reed,
who won last year’s Masters
, hosted his first Champions Dinner at Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia for past winners and Fred Ridley, the club chairman.
The dinners are private affairs away from the nattering galleries and clicking cameras — no spouses or media. They are held at the plantation-style clubhouse, inside the front door, 13 carpeted steps up the spiral staircase and to the right in what’s called the library, a cozy room with bookshelves, a fireplace, a bronze sculpture of Bobby Jones and a portrait of Clifford Roberts, a club founder, painted by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who joined the club in 1948.
The Masters Club began the Champions Dinner during the 1952 tournament when the defending champion Ben Hogan gave a dinner for the previous winners. Hogan proposed the formation of the Masters Club, with its membership limited to Masters champions.
“I wish to invite you to attend a stag dinner at the Augusta National,” Hogan wrote in an invitation.
“My only stipulation is that you wear your green coat.”
Honorary memberships were also extended to Jones and Roberts. Later, attendees included the club and tournament chairmen Bill Lane, Hord Hardin, Jack Stephens, Hootie Johnson, Billy Payne and Ridley.
As part of the tradition, the defending champion selects the menu and hosts the dinner, where players in their green jackets mingle over drinks before dining, with views overlooking the back terrace, the practice putting green, the 18th green and the first tee.
Reed was ready with a menu he’s had in mind since he was a teenager.
“Oh, I knew that back when I was 13,” Reed, 28, told reporters at the Players Championship. “It was always a bone-in rib-eye, mac and cheese, creamed corn, creamed spinach. I’m going to fatten those boys up a little bit.
“I could eat a rib-eye steak for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and mac and cheese, same thing,” he said. “It was one of those things where it was a pretty easy decision, it was just kind of refine it a little bit and bring up options where if guys don’t want to eat something heavy they have a lighter option as well. I really just want everyone to enjoy the night and have something good to eat, no matter what it is.”
The menu did not surprise the three-time Masters winner Gary Player, who is from South Africa. “He clearly is a meat-and-potato kind of guy — seems fitting a Texan chose this meal,” Player said.
The meal choices often reveal something about the player: where they’re from, what they miss and what they simply really want to eat.
Past winners
have selected haggis (Sandy Lyle, 1989), Wiener schnitzel (Bernhard Langer, 1986), elk (Mike Weir, 2004), meat pie (Trevor Immelman, 2009), fajitas (Mark O’Meara, 1999), paella (José Maria Olazábal, 1995) and cheeseburgers and fries (Tiger Woods, 1998). Jordan Spieth, a Texan, did Texas barbecue in 2016.
Some men are creatures of habit. Bubba Watson served the exact same menu in 2013 and 2015: Caesar salad, grilled chicken breast with sides of green beans, mashed potatoes, corn, macaroni and cheese, and cornbread.
“All interesting choices that made different statements based largely on personality, geography and the message they were sending to the other champions,” Player said. “The South African champions selected a typical braai or barbecue, for example, with some very good South African wines. The international winners love sharing their culture at the dinner, showing how the tournament has grown globally.”
Player selected his menus to show respect to all players and countries and to take note of how international the Masters has become.
Phil Mickelson, an American, picked paella in 2011, leaving some puzzled.
“I like when the guys bring their culture into the meal,” said Dave DiBenedetto, editor in chief of Garden & Gun, a Southern lifestyle magazine that also covers golf. “I was curious about Phil’s pick, but then I realized it was in honor of Seve Ballesteros.”
Ballesteros of Spain, a two-time Masters winner, was ill at the time and could not make the tournament that year. Mickelson selected a Spanish menu, including gazpacho, beef tenderloin with manchego cheese and tortilla, and Spanish apple pie with ice cream.
“Phil took the honor of picking his own meal and gave that honor to a friend who couldn’t be there because he was sick,” DiBenedetto said.
The meals are almost always prepared by the staff of the club kitchen, except for Vijay Singh after his 2000 win. The club permitted Singh to invite chefs from Atlanta, who imported ingredients from Thailand for chicken Panang curry, sea scallops in garlic sauce and Chilean sea bass with a chili glaze, served family style. After the meal, Singh brought the chefs to the dining room, where they received a standing ovation.
“It is always fun,” Player said. “Lots of jokes. Stories. I used to sit next to Bobby Jones and cut his meat as his hands were riddled with arthritis. Ben Hogan hated that it had become an autograph session.
“We always joke and laugh about the different menu choices, so yes we do notice,” Player said. “Some enjoy the different dishes the current champion selects, others choose to order something specific to fit their dietary needs, which is understandable.’
And if the night’s dinner selection isn’t appealing, players can always order off the menu. The turkey club is always a safe choice.
