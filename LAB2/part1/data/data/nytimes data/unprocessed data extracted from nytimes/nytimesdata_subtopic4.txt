RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. — Ally McDonald started the weekend as the highest L.P.G.A. nonwinner on the ANA Inspiration leaderboard. Could she become the second consecutive player, after Pernille Lindberg, to make the year’s first major her first L.P.G.A. victory?
Back in Mississippi, her home state, the players who competed against McDonald in high school know better than to discount her chances. After she took the first-round lead, two men posted recollections on the L.P.G.A.’s Facebook page of being outclassed by McDonald, who won the boys’ state championship in her senior year at Itawamba Agricultural High School.
McDonald, 26, competed on the boys’ team because there wasn’t enough interest to field a girls’ squad. “Once I got to probably my freshman, sophomore year, the state changed regulations and I had to move back to the boys’ tees,” McDonald said on Friday, adding, “They said if I was going to play with the boys, then you’re going to have to play where the boys play from.”
McDonald, who carded a two-over 74 on Saturday and is six strokes behind the leader, Jin Young Ko, recalled winning the state title on a course that was longer than Mission Hills Country Club’s 6,834-yard layout, and in their Facebook posts, Peyton Dunlap and Chandler Thompson remembered her “whipping up” on them. There were a few exceptions, said McDonald, who went on to star at Mississippi State, “but as a whole, the guys that I was surrounded by always respected me.”
On the L.P.G.A. Tour, the women are playing for more than money, trophies and world-ranking points. “What we’re working toward is having the same amount of respect that the men get,” said Jessica Korda, the women’s world No. 11.
Korda, who is in a group tied for eighth with, among others, McDonald after a third-round 71, is the women’s leader in the inaugural Aon Risk Reward Challenge, a competition on the PGA and L.P.G.A. Tours featuring a running tally of players’ scores on designated holes. At the end of the season, the players on each tour with the lowest scores in relation to par will receive $1 million bonuses.
“It’s a great step in the right direction,” Korda said, referring to the equal prize money.
The Tuesday before the first round of the ANA Inspiration was Equal Pay Day, the point in 2019 that women had to work until to earn what men made in 2018. In golf, the gender pay disparity is glaring.
When Georgia Hall won the Women’s British Open at Royal Lytham last August, she earned $490,000. A month earlier, Francesco Molinari collected $1.89 million for his victory at the men’s British Open at Carnoustie.
“It’s not only golf, clearly, it’s society, and we need to aim for having the same opportunities and the same prize fund in this eventually,” Molinari said last month.
Molinari has spent time around Hall at events for AON, a global professional services firm that uses both as brand ambassadors. Like McDonald’s male high school teammates, Molinari has more respect for Hall after getting to know her.
“The main thing is when you meet women like that, you see in the end we do the same thing, we have the same drive, the same passion, the same dreams,” he said. “Everything is exactly the same.”
The onus is not on the women to narrow the gap, he added, but on their male peers and on those who control the corporate coffers.
“What we can do as players is support the ladies’ tour,” Molinari said. “But I think the main thing is the exposure they get. It’s nowhere near where it should be, and that creates less interest in sponsors, less money.”
Molinari’s words rang as true as bird song Saturday as the best women in the world took a back seat to the top up-and-coming women, whose final round of the Augusta National Women’s Amateur, played on the same course that will host next week’s Masters, was shown on NBC. The three hours of network coverage bestowed upon the likes of the winner, the women’s world No. 1 amateur, Jennifer Kupcho, and the runner-up, Maria Fassi of Mexico, was three hours more than was conferred on McDonald, Korda, Hall and Company at the ANA Inspiration.
To Molinari’s point, neither Bank of America nor AT&T, two of the corporate sponsors whose girl-power-themed ads were in heavy rotation during Saturday’s Augusta women’s amateur final-round coverage, sponsors an L.P.G.A. event.
“I think all we can do is try to play the best golf we can and show the public and the sponsors and the media what we can do,” Hall said.
On this great week for women’s golf, is it progress that the Augusta National Women’s Amateur runner-up had a bigger stage and audience than the reigning Women’s British Open winner?
On the eve of the ANA Inspiration, which started on Thursday, the L.P.G.A. commissioner, Mike Whan, told reporters: “In my mind, the Augusta Women’s Amateur is an evolution, not a revolution. But maybe in time, it will be the revolution that I want it to be.”

(Reuters) - Malaysian golfer Arie Irawan died of ""apparent natural causes"" on Sunday in his hotel room on the Chinese resort island of Hainan, the PGA tour said in a statement. He was 28.
Arie, who turned professional in 2013 and won two events on the Asian Development Tour in 2015, had missed the halfway cut at the Sanya Championship, the second event on the PGA Tour China Series.
""The PGA Tour and the China Golf Association grieve at this loss of one of our members and share sincere condolences with Arie's wife, Marina, and his parents, Ahmad and Jeny,"" the PGA tour statement added.
""When something of this magnitude occurs in the golf world, we all grieve at the same time.
""Out of respect for the family, officials cancelled the final round of the Sanya Championship, the tournament becoming a 54-hole event.""
The coroner's report had not been completed, the statement said.
Trevor Sluman, who shot a third-round six-under 66 to take a two-shot lead on Saturday, was declared the champion and his victory will count as an official PGA TOUR Series-China win.
The American offered his condolences after he learned of the round's cancellation.
""My heart goes out to Arie's family and his beautiful wife, Marina,"" Sluman said.
""Along with the rest of the Tour, we're thinking about them at this time. It's very bittersweet today, and I think the rest of the year will be dedicated to Arie and the impact he had on this Tour.""
Arie's golf career was interrupted in 2016 when he was involved in an accident on a moped and sidelined for several months. He was ranked 1,366th in the world this week.
He married Marina Malek last May and she sometimes worked as his caddie, even if Arie admitted that she did not know much about golf.
""If I make a bad score she will say 'it is okay, it is okay',"" he told Malaysia's The Star newspaper last year.
""She keeps me calm, relaxed and happy so I just go out there and play golf. That helps me a lot. She has always been there for me through the bad and good times.""

AUGUSTA, GA — Tommy Fleetwood may already be one of golf's most recognizable players but the mop-topped Englishman is determined to be marked out as winner rather than for a great head of hair.
Looking more like a member of Hall of Fame rock band Fleetwood Mac than the PGA Tour, the 28-year-old, with his scruffy beard and long locks spilling out from under a baseball cap, was easily distinguishable from the cookie cutter golfing crowd getting in some practice on Monday at Augusta National ahead of the Masters.
Considering Fleetwood's PGA Tour resume does not yet include a title, he would not have drawn much attention had it not been for his ""better to burn out than fade away"" approach to tournament play which has amplified his rocker image.
That ""all in"" attitude was on full display during the final round of the Players Championship last month when he was trailing Rory McIlroy by two strokes with two holes to play. Fleetwood attacked the pin on the infamous 17th island green and paid the price as his title hopes ended in a watery grave.
""I don't know why people would expect me to play for the middle of the green if I had a chance of catching Rory,"" Fleetwood told reporters. ""Maybe that's my difference than some other people, I'm always going to play to win.
""Not that golf will ever define me as a person but I'm never going to look back on my career and say, oh, I finished third at the Players, that was a good week. Or, oh, I finished top five at the Masters, I made a couple of nice pars on the last to finish top five.
""That's probably something I'll never say to my kids or grandkids. That's not something to be that proud of.
""Winning is what it's all about.""
While Fleetwood is still chasing a maiden PGA Tour title, he does know his way to the winner's circle with four victories on the European Tour.
He has regularly featured on the leaderboard at majors, including a runner-up finish at last year's U.S. Open and has shown good form this season with three top 10s.
More importantly Fleetwood believes his Masters apprenticeship has reached the point where he can fight for a green jacket.
After missing the cut in his first visit to Augusta in 2017, Fleetwood improved to a 17th place finish last year. He showed signs that he was getting comfortable with the layout after carding a six-under 66 in the third round.
""Year one, it's all so new,"" said Fleetwood. ""Year two, you've been here already, so you're more comfortable with it and it just kind of progresses.
""There's a different atmosphere.
""It's the first major of the year and ... everything that's happened before just doesn't really matter.
""You know, this is it.""

AUGUSTA, Ga. — It has been 11 years since Tiger Woods last won a major and 14 since he claimed a Green Jacket yet like Augusta National itself some things never seem to change as the 43 year-old again took his place in the Masters spotlight on Tuesday.
""If Tiger wins my goodness what's that story going to be, it might make the morning papers -- for the next three months,"" six-time major winner Nick Faldo replied when asked what might be the Masters' biggest storylines when play begins.
Since Woods made his Masters debut in 1995 until a rainy practice round on Tuesday, the American has been the main attraction at the year's first major.
Even when Woods was not at Augusta National, missing the 2014, 2016 and 2017 tournaments due to injury, he was never out of the Masters conversation.
Without a major win since notching number 14 at the 2008 U.S. Open, Woods's Masters drought stretches back even further to 2005 before either of his children, 11 year-old Sam and 10 year-old Charlie, were born.
For golf fans it is a dry spell that is hard to comprehend and for Woods one he admits he never saw coming.
""I would say that I wouldn't have foreseen that, for sure,"" said Woods. ""After I won my 14th, I felt like I still had plenty more major championships that I could win, but unfortunately I just didn't do it.
""Hopefully this year, I put myself there again, and hopefully I'll get it done.""
PROMISING SIGNS
As Thursday's first round approaches Tiger-mania is picking up steam.
After successful back fusion surgery and a long tedious recovery Woods returned to the winner's circle last year, picking up his 80th career title with a stunning victory at the Tour Championship.
Perhaps an even more promising sign of a major breakthrough came at last year's British Open and PGA Championship where he contended in both events.
""It proved to me that I could win again,"" Woods said of his Tour Championship victory. ""You know, I was close a couple of times.
""I just need to clean up my rounds and maybe need to get a break here or there.""
Nowhere does the Tiger mystique hang over an event more than at the Masters.
Augusta National has long been a happy place for Woods who along with his four wins has been runner-up twice with a third and three fourth-place finishes.
""I know that I can play this golf course,"" he said. ""I've had some success here. This is unlike any other golf tournament. The golf course is special.
""The tournament does an incredible job of creating a special atmosphere but it's also the patrons and how you can tell birdie roars and eagle roars. It's neat to hear.
""I've felt it and it's exciting to be part of and hopefully I can be part of it come Sunday night.""

(Reuters) - Dutchman Daan Huizing made nine birdies to take the lead in the first round of the Jordan Mixed Open, the first professional tournament with men and women competing against each other for the same prize, on Thursday.
Huizing shot an eight-under 64 in Aqaba to lead England's Meghan MacLaren, a Ladies European Tour winner, and her compatriot Jack Senior by one stroke.
Forty professionals and one amateur player each from the Challenge Tour, the over-50s Tour and the Ladies European Tour are in the field, competing for a prize fund of around $400,000.
""Today was pretty complete and I was shaping the ball nicely, both ways, which is something I've worked on very hard over the winter,"" Huizing told reporters.
""I made some good putts and mentally I was in good shape as well, sticking to my process, so there are a lot of good signs and I'm looking forward to tomorrow.""
MacLaren, who sparked debate in January over the disparity in pay between men's and women's events, was happy to finish among the leaders after setting the early clubhouse target.
""If I'm going to write about it and talk about it all the time, then I better back it up with my golf,"" MacLaren, the only woman to finish in the top 10, said. ""If I'm up there it means the girls can take advantage.
""I'm delighted to do it at this tournament because hopefully it will send a message. But any time you shoot seven under in any tournament you're not going to be too far off the lead.""
The course was designed by Australian Greg Norman who was world number one for over 300 weeks in the 1980s and 1990s.
""To construct a format in which women and men compete together over the same course is an impressive feat,"" Norman said in a statement.
""There is no doubt that events that showcase golfing talent regardless of gender, such as the Jordan Mixed Open... are the future of the game.""
The Challenge Tour players are playing from tees making up a 7,152-yard course, the seniors cover 6,601 yards and the women 6,139 yards.
""Our first and primary priority was to engineer a format that could showcase golfing talent regardless of gender,"" director of operations Chris White said.
""This not only means taking into consideration carry yardages, both off the tee and throughout the player's whole bag, but also the positioning of bunkers and hazards.""
Although the Jordan tournament is the first, official mixed gender tournament, men and women have competed against each other previously, most notably at the Wendy's 3-Tour Challenge, a single-day event which ran from 1992-2013.

AUGUSTA, Georgia — A lot of fathers found themselves out of jobs on Friday as golfers playing in the Augusta National Women's Amateur (ANWA) opted for club caddies over daddies for the final round.
After the opening two rounds of the 54-hole tournament staged at Champions Retreat in nearby Evans, awed young women, many with their equally-awed fathers on their bags, got first look at the revered layout that is home for the Masters, the year's first major.
But walking with their daughters in Friday's practice round is as close as some dad caddies will come to Augusta National with several deciding on a switch and handing their fathers pink slips.
While dads may know their daughters better than anyone, local caddies, some who have worked Augusta National for decades, know the course and particularly the baffling greens.
For some, including Jennifer Kupcho, who will take a one- shot lead over Mexico’s Maria Fassi into the final round, that kind of knowledge trumps family ties.
The world's top-ranked amateur, Kupcho's decision to go with a local caddie was an easy one, although the American laughed she had not yet broken the news to her father Michael.
""I had my caddie there with me the first time I played so we had fun and he knows what he is doing,"" said Kupcho, who used the same caddie Brian Murphy when she played Augusta as a guest. ""I think he's hired.""
HISTORIC DAY
Instead of being part of an historic day on which the first competitive women's round will be played at Augusta National and a champion crowned, Michael Kupcho will watch from outside the ropes along with Kevin Harford, who was on his daughter Haylee's bag the first two rounds.
A tough choice, however, was made easier when Harford told his daughter the smart move might be to go with a local caddie.
""We came into the day kind of trying to figure it out and I was going to decide afterwards but I think I am going to go to a local caddie because they know so much,"" said Haylee, who sits at one-over, six off the pace.
""But my dad was able to kind of walk to get some notes and feel it out so we could make that decision.
""He's willing to do anything that makes me happy and is best for me so he kind of came to me on the second hole and said I don't know maybe you should take the caddie.""
For Spain's Marta Perez, who describes herself as a golfer who plays with passion and emotion, having someone on her bag who can read her is more important than reading greens.
And in her case father Jose knows best.
""My dad, he is my coach, he started coaching me when I was eight years old so this is special for me,"" said Perez.
""We had a discussion if it was better to have a local caddie tomorrow but I want to stick with our plan I think it is great that he is here, he knows me more than anyone.
""I think it is special for him to be here with me because we are going to remember this forever.""

(Reuters) - Kim Si-woo reeled off five birdies in a six-hole stretch en route to the first-round lead at the Texas Open in San Antonio on Thursday.
The South Korean carded six-under-par 66 for a one-stroke advantage over Mexican Abraham Ancer, Venezuelan Jhonattan Vegas and Americans Chris Stroud and J.T. Poston at TPC San Antonio.
Kim's place at next week's Masters is already assured but the four players behind him all need to win on Sunday to punch the final ticket to the first major championship of the year.
Rickie Fowler and Jordan Spieth, among only a handful of the big names using the Texas Open to tune-up for the Masters, both shot 68 on an unusually benign day in a typically windy location.
Spieth more than most could do with a boost in confidence before heading to Augusta National, where his 2015 victory kicked off a major year that with a little luck could have ended with a calendar grand slam.
But he has been out-of-sorts this year so was in an upbeat mood after his round.
""Other than one three-putt it was kind of a bogey-free type round, putting myself in position on those approach shots to make par at worse,"" he told Golf Channel.
""Swing is getting there, putting stroke feels really good, it's progressing day to day.
""(I'm pleased with) the overall way I attacked the golf course to limit the amount of mistakes.""
Fowler, second behind Patrick Reed at the Masters last year, was also pleased with his round.
""It's always nice to get out and make some birdies early, shake off some rust,"" said Fowler, who skipped last week's WGC-Match Play.
A strong week would also be a nice tonic for world number 61 Kim, who has struggled over the last month.
Starting his round at the 10th, he was plodding along at even par after seven holes, but birdied the next two with putts of five feet before slipping with a bogey at the first.
He responded magnificently with five birdies in the next six holes to grab the lead.
""If I'm reading (the greens) good I can putt well,"" he said.

AUGUSTA, Ga. — The Mexican flag has been waving proudly at Augusta National with amateur Alvaro Ortiz taking the baton from Maria Fassi and carrying it into this week's Masters with his eyes on a Green Jacket.
After a four-decade absence, Augusta National is getting a fresh taste of Latin flair served up by a new generation of Mexican golfers primed to battle for titles.
Fassi provided Ortiz with a tough act to follow by finishing runner-up to Jennifer Kupcho in the inaugural Augusta National Women's Amateur after a stirring back-nine battle with the American on Saturday.
Now Ortiz steps into the spotlight as he becomes the first player from his country since Victor Regalado in 1979 to play at the Masters and only the second Mexican amateur following Juan Antonio Estrada who featured at Augusta from 1962-64.
The determined Ortiz finished runner-up in the two previous Latin America Amateur Championship tournaments before this year claiming the title and his Masters invite at the third attempt.
""It was a huge deal for my family and me for sure and the whole country,"" said Ortiz, who will turn professional immediately after the Masters. ""When I came back to Mexico after winning, it was all cheers and people were so happy.
""People were so proud that I was going to be able to put a Mexican flag up there.""
Ortiz said he had received plenty of advice ahead of Thursday's opening round with most people telling him to relax and enjoy the experience.
But the 23-year-old, showing no fear and more than a little cockiness, said he would be trying to win a Green Jacket like everyone else, although admitting if given a chance to sign for a top 10 right now he would take it.
""In my mind, I'm out here to compete and I want the Green Jacket,"" he said. ""I think every player is thinking like that.
""Of course, winning the low amateur would be nice,"" he said referring to the Silver Cup awarded to the lowest amateur to make the cut.
""Making the cut would be a really good finish too but if you give me a top 10 right now, I'll sign it for sure.""
While a top 10 finish would guarantee a Masters invite next year, Ortiz is soaking up every moment of his experience now.
He will spend Monday night in the Crow's Nest above the Augusta National clubhouse, where amateurs have traditionally slept, and promised to bite into the local delicacy -- a pimento cheese sandwich -- at some point.
""Yeah, everybody was talking about that,"" Ortiz said with a smile. ""Actually, I received more arguments about the... chicken barbecue sandwich, which I think is pretty good. I already tried that one, but I'll have to try the pimento cheese.""

AUGUSTA, Georgia — Women will have their day at Augusta National on Saturday when the golf club, once ground zero in the gender equality battle, hosts the final round of the Augusta National Women's Amateur (ANWA).
The word historic has been attached to the first ever competitive women's round at the home of the Masters and the occasion will be given the full treatment, with NBC providing live coverage and Augusta National rolling out the pomp, ceremony and tradition that is its trademark.
The image of 30 women competing at a club which only seven years ago did not have a single female member is being held up as another small victory for equality.
Martha Burk, who put Augusta National's all-male membership policy under a microscope, will not be celebrating mocking the ANWA as a public relations stunt but the 77-year-old activist says she and her group of protesters will take credit for sparking the little progress that has been made.
""I just don't have any doubt about that at all if no public pressure or international spotlight had been shined on it thanks to us they would still be doing the same thing and getting away with it,"" Burk told Reuters. ""I'm sorry I'm just not buying it.
""People are going to say it is just sour grapes because she did not succeed in her crusade back in 2003 but I think what progress we are seeing is a direct result of what we did.""
What Burk did 16 years ago was put unwanted scrutiny on Augusta National Golf Club and its gender discrimination policy.
Founded by Bobby Jones and Clifford Roberts and opened for play in 1933, Augusta National became a sanctuary for some of the world's most powerful men and for decades remained unmoved by outside forces and events.
It would be nearly 80 years until Augusta National relented in 2012, with former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and financier Darla Moore becoming the first women to don the iconic Green Jackets that distinguish members and Masters champions.
Holding up Augusta National as a relic of the past, the National Council of Women's Organisations spearheaded by Burk took their fight to the club's doorstep during 2003 Masters week, drawing the attention of the world's media.
Augusta National could not stop the protest but was able to keep it well away from the club's doorstep, a court order restricting the event to a muddy field out of view of patrons and sponsors.
The protest failed to draw the numbers it hoped for, collapsing into a near farce with clowns and an Elvis impersonator getting as much attention as Burk herself.
While the mood was light, the seriousness of the issue was underscored by Burk having to demonstrate wearing a bullet proof vest while the FBI tapped her phone chasing down death threats.
""If social media had been around I would be dead,"" Burk said. ""I got so many death threats over Augusta, that day I was wearing a bullet proof vest and I had hired body guards because people were just rampant about it and I really do believe if social media had existed somebody would have tracked me down and shot me.""
ABSOLUTE SECRECY
One of the world's most exclusive clubs, Augusta National operates in absolute secrecy. Even the smallest detail such as who dry cleans the Green Jackets is classified.
The club's most heavily guarded secret, however, is its membership and when Burk was leaked a list of the 300 Green Jackets her group mounted a campaign urging consumers to boycott Masters sponsors.
Her organization also facilitated two sex discrimination lawsuits against Smith Barney, a division of Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley, whose CEOs were Augusta members, and collected $79 million in settlements.
It was that legal action, Burk believes, that produced the first cracks in Augusta National's resolve.
""I did not feel particularly defeated,"" said Burk, reflecting on her 2003 protest. ""I know people expected me to go crawl into a hole and never come out because we weren't successful but we just kept trucking along.
""We had a list of all the members and the companies they were affiliated with and I think the club knew that they weren't going to be the last two lawsuits.
""I knew you could not put that genie back in the bottle it was going to come up as it has every year.
""I knew that eventually something would come of it.
""Will they ever be true converts as opposed to Easter Sunday Christians? I don't know but at least they are making the right noises.
""It is never going to go away for them.""

AUGUSTA, Georgia — Women will have their day at Augusta National on Saturday when the golf club, once ground zero in the gender equality battle, hosts the final round of the Augusta National Women's Amateur (ANWA).
The word historic has been attached to the first ever competitive women's round at the home of the Masters and the occasion will be given the full treatment, with NBC providing live coverage and Augusta National rolling out the pomp, ceremony and tradition that is its trademark.
The image of 30 women competing at a club which only seven years ago did not have a single female member is being held up as another small victory for equality.
Martha Burk, who put Augusta National's all-male membership policy under a microscope, will not be celebrating mocking the ANWA as a public relations stunt but the 77-year-old activist says she and her group of protesters will take credit for sparking the little progress that has been made.
""I just don't have any doubt about that at all if no public pressure or international spotlight had been shined on it thanks to us they would still be doing the same thing and getting away with it,"" Burk told Reuters. ""I'm sorry I'm just not buying it.
""People are going to say it is just sour grapes because she did not succeed in her crusade back in 2003 but I think what progress we are seeing is a direct result of what we did.""
What Burk did 16 years ago was put unwanted scrutiny on Augusta National Golf Club and its gender discrimination policy.
Founded by Bobby Jones and Clifford Roberts and opened for play in 1933, Augusta National became a sanctuary for some of the world's most powerful men and for decades remained unmoved by outside forces and events.
It would be nearly 80 years until Augusta National relented in 2012, with former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and financier Darla Moore becoming the first women to don the iconic Green Jackets that distinguish members and Masters champions.
Holding up Augusta National as a relic of the past, the National Council of Women's Organisations spearheaded by Burk took their fight to the club's doorstep during 2003 Masters week, drawing the attention of the world's media.
Augusta National could not stop the protest but was able to keep it well away from the club's doorstep, a court order restricting the event to a muddy field out of view of patrons and sponsors.
The protest failed to draw the numbers it hoped for, collapsing into a near farce with clowns and an Elvis impersonator getting as much attention as Burk herself.
While the mood was light, the seriousness of the issue was underscored by Burk having to demonstrate wearing a bullet proof vest while the FBI tapped her phone chasing down death threats.
""If social media had been around I would be dead,"" Burk said. ""I got so many death threats over Augusta, that day I was wearing a bullet proof vest and I had hired body guards because people were just rampant about it and I really do believe if social media had existed somebody would have tracked me down and shot me.""
ABSOLUTE SECRECY
One of the world's most exclusive clubs, Augusta National operates in absolute secrecy. Even the smallest detail such as who dry cleans the Green Jackets is classified.
The club's most heavily guarded secret, however, is its membership and when Burk was leaked a list of the 300 Green Jackets her group mounted a campaign urging consumers to boycott Masters sponsors.
Her organisation also facilitated two sex discrimination lawsuits against Smith Barney, a division of Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley, whose CEOs were Augusta members, and collected $79 million in settlements.
It was that legal action, Burk believes, that produced the first cracks in Augusta National's resolve.
""I did not feel particularly defeated,"" said Burk, reflecting on her 2003 protest. ""I know people expected me to go crawl into a hole and never come out because we weren't successful but we just kept trucking along.
""We had a list of all the members and the companies they were affiliated with and I think the club knew that they weren't going to be the last two lawsuits.
""I knew you could not put that genie back in the bottle it was going to come up as it has every year.
""I knew that eventually something would come of it.
""Will they ever be true converts as opposed to Easter Sunday Christians? I don't know but at least they are making the right noises.
""It is never going to go away for them.""

AUGUSTA, Georgia — When Justin Rose launches his 14th bid for Masters glory this week he will be armed with expert knowledge of Augusta National's notoriously tricky greens and something perhaps even more valuable -- a good friend.
After three months apart, the newly re-minted world number one told reporters on Monday that he was pleased to be reunited with long-time caddie Mark 'Fooch' Fulcher, who had to take time off following heart surgery in January.
""I feel like we've learned together so much here, I wouldn't expect a nugget of information I don't know to come out during practice,"" Rose said after a practice round.
He added that Fulcher's presence would be especially valuable in the later rounds of the tournament, when emotions run high.
""It's when the going gets tough,"" Rose said. ""We have so many positive experiences out there under pressure that we can draw on together.""
The 2013 U.S. Open champion has clinched a top-10 finish on five separate occasions at The Masters.
But perhaps no single outing at Augusta National was more formative to Rose than his devastating playoff loss to Spaniard Sergio Garcia in 2017.
""I felt like that was the first major I've been close to and not won, really, like a heartbreaker,"" Rose said. ""I think I took comfort in the fact that you can't get through a career without something like that happening.""
It was far from the only setback. Injuries to his shoulder and back nagged at Rose in 2014 and 2016, respectively, and he pulled out of an August 2018 World Golf Championships event citing joint tightness.
The 38-year-old Olympic gold medalist has had time to bounce back, notably netting his 10th PGA tour victory in January with a two-shot win over Adam Scott at Torrey Pines.
Rose, who took a month off in February after missing the cut at the Saudi International, is now looking to add to his trophy case with a second major win.
""I would take four, as long as it's one of each,"" Rose said. ""That would be awesome. That would be enough.""

(Reuters) - South Korean Kim Si-woo almost aced the same hole for the second day running en route to a one-stroke lead over Canadian Corey Conners in the third round of the Texas Open on Saturday.
A day after holing a nine-iron from 167 yards at the par-three 16th on Friday, Kim took dead aim with a seven-iron at the same hole, which measured 190 yards on Saturday.
His ball landed a couple of yards in front of the cup and nearly went in on the second bounce before settling four feet away.
Kim threw his club into the air and placed his hands on his head upon narrowly failing to pull off what would have been an astronomically unlikely feat.
""I saw that first bounce and then right at it. I thought going in for sure this time,"" Kim told Golf Channel. ""Just missed it.""
He also missed the birdie putt, but made amends by sinking a birdie from similar distance at the last for a three-under-par 69 at TPC San Antonio.
Conners shot 66 to jump into second place on 14-under while
American Charley Hoffman carded 64, the best round of the day, to vault within two shots of the lead on an afternoon that started rainy before clearing up by the back nine.
Kim, seeking to lead wire-to-wire, has two victories on the PGA Tour, notably the 2017 Players Championship. The 23-year-old is not the most consistent performer, but has shown he can beat anyone when on his game.
Conners has yet to win at the highest level, and is so low on the tour's pecking order that he had to run the gauntlet of a Monday qualifier -- competing for four spots -- just to get into the Texas Open.
Victory on Sunday would earn him the last spot in next week's Masters.
""I've managed my game really well,"" Conners said.
""I've struck the ball really solidly and I was able to roll in a few putts today. Gave myself a ton of chances, hit a lot of quality iron shots set up by some good tee balls.""
Hoffman has four PGA Tour wins, including the 2016 Texas Open.
His 64 included seven birdies, along with an eagle at the par-five 18th, where he struck a superb three-wood from 290 yards that had an eye on the pin the entire way.
""Flushed it,"" said the laid-back Californian. ""It landed way softer than I anticipated. Very lucky to leave myself an uphill 10-footer.""

Jin Young Ko vaulted from fifth-ranked to No. 1 overall in the Rolex Women's World Golf Rankings on Monday, one day after the South Korean claimed her first major title.
Ko fired a 2-under-par round of 70 on Sunday to win the 2019 ANA Inspiration at Mission Hills Country Club in Rancho Mirage, Calif.
The 23-year-old Ko finished at 10-under 278 to become the fifth South Korean winner of the tournament.
Now, she's the fifth South Korean player to reach No. 1 status, joining Inbee Park, Sung Hyun Park, So Yeon Ryu and Jiyai Shin.
""Reaching World No. 1 is exciting and I cannot believe that I have achieved this honor,"" Ko said in a statement. ""I always keep my focus on the golf course and on my playing, but to win a major championship and be called the best player in the world is absolutely a great honor. I want to thank my family, my caddie and my manager for all of their support.""
Her title Sunday was Ko's second victory of 2019, as she also claimed the 2019 Bank of Hope Founders Cup in mid-March. With the win, she earned 625 points and extended her lead in the Race to the CME Globe, where she entered the tournament 177 points ahead of Nelly Korda (1,155).
Sung Hyun Park, supplanted at No. 1 after five weeks, struggled to a 6-over 78 to finish at 4 over in a tie for 52nd. She fell to second place, just ahead of Thailand's Ariya Jutanugarn -- who started the year at No. 1.
Australia's Minjee Lee and Japan's Nasa Hataoka round out the top five.
American Lexi Thompson, who finished third on Sunday, jumped three spots to No. 6.

Augusta, Ga. — While the Masters is renowned for attracting the world's top players, a busy PGA tournament schedule and a field of competitors perpetually in flux means you never know who else might be in the field at Augusta National.
First-timer Keith Mitchell likes it that way.
The 27-year-old American makes his Masters debut by virtue of securing his first PGA championship last month at the Honda Classic, claiming victory with a final, 15-foot birdie putt.
""There are forty-something events, there are going to be guys that get their first win every year,"" Mitchell told reporters on Monday.
""What's so great about our sport is the unknown, someone who you might have never heard of wins this week and then you might be able to follow him for the next ten years.""
While the University of Georgia graduate played the Augusta National course as a college student, he is better acquainted with life among the throngs of spectators.
Of course, a practice round in the glare of The Masters spotlight changed that.
""There were probably more people watching me warm up on a Monday here than at a lot of tournaments I've played in my life,"" Mitchell said.
""I've always watched people and admired how they hit the shots and hit their wedges and the shapes of the drivers, and then I was the guy that people were watching.""
With six top-10 career PGA finishes, Mitchell will look to establish his foothold in the year's first major, when The Masters kicks off on Thursday.
""I still kind of feel like a rookie and still feel just kind of in awe of the place,"" Mitchell said. ""And I hope that never goes away.""

(Reuters) - After missing the proverbial boat for the inaugural Augusta National Women's Amateur, the Jutanugarn sisters Ariya and Moriya instead made do with a chance to caddie in the par 3 competition at the Masters on Wednesday.
They shared the bag toting duties for fellow Thai Kiradech Aphibarnrat, even teeing it up on one hole, where all three swung simultaneously.
Ariya and Moriya turned professional in 2012, seven years before women finally got a chance to stride Augusta National's famous fairways in competition, albeit sans professionals.
""We want to play it,"" said world number three Ariya of the course as she and Moriya stood in their white caddie overalls outside the clubhouse on a warm and cloudless afternoon.
A visit last year allowed Ariya to admire the beauty of Augusta.
""Last year when I walked with Kiradech all 18 (holes) twice, I thought this course is amazing,"" she said.
""I thought one time in my life I would really like to play here. I'm really jealous.""
Ariya and Moriya have earned between them $11 in career prize-money on the LPGA Tour.
But that does not stop them from wishing they had enjoyed a chance to compete at Augusta National.
""We don't have that chance when it is our time,"" said Moriya, before adding ""hopefully one day.""

(Reuters) - A jubilant Kim Si-woo aced the 16th hole to push his lead to four strokes after the second round of the Texas Open at San Antonio on Friday.
A group of six players, including headliners Jordan Spieth and Rickie Fowler, were left in second place after the overnight leader's hole-in-one.
Kim, who started the day with a one-stroke advantage, drove a nine iron to the green at the 167-yard par-three then watched the ball bounce into the hole.
The South Korean world number 61 tossed his club aside and thrust both arms into the air in celebration at his second career hole-in-one on the PGA Tour.
""I saw the bounce, but I never see it go in,"" said the 23-year-old, who estimated he has made six or seven holes-in-one in all.
Kim, aiming for his third PGA Tour victory, ended the round at 12-under 132 thanks to four birdies and the ace in his second consecutive 66.
""I saw the solo lead last four holes [and I said] I can make birdie, just trying to go aggressive,"" said Kim.
His previous PGA wins came at the Wyndham in 2016 and the Players Championship in 2017.
Spieth and Fowler, who both shot 68 for the second round in a row, shared second with fellow Americans Harold Varner (66) and Adam Schenk (66) as well as Canadian Corey Conners (67) and Kim's compatriot Lee Kyoung-hoon (67).
MASTERS TUNE-UP
Fowler at one point led Kim on nine-under for the tournament but back-to-back bogeys at the 15th and 16th were costly.
The 2018 Masters runner-up had been rolling along with four birdies and an eagle at the par four fifth hole against one bogey before the let down.
The eagle came after Fowler's drive had carried 328 yards to within four feet of the hole. He collected a fifth birdie at the 17th to ease his displeasure.
""I'm happy with it,"" Fowler said of the round. ""Hit some good shots out there, made a few putts. Yeah, 15, 16, kind of a little unforced errors.""
The wind was a factor in both bogeys, he said.
Former Masters champion Spieth, along with Fowler among only a handful of big names using the Texas Open to tune up for Augusta next week, also had an eagle. His came at the par-five eighth, his 17th hole of the day.
After two bogeys sandwiching a birdie in his first three holes, the Texan rebounded for four more birdies and the eagle to go with another bogey.
""I had more control with my long clubs today,"" Spieth said. ""Still didn't hit many fairways, but it felt better, if that makes sense.
""So normally the better results come from the club starting to feel more in control. So I'll just do a little bit of light work this afternoon and go into the weekend with a chance to win.""

(Reuters) - Ko Jin-young joined the long list of South Korean LPGA major champions on Sunday with a three-shot victory over compatriot Lee Mi-hyang at the ANA Inspiration in Rancho Mirage, California.
Ko, last year's Rookie of the Year, overcame a late wobble in the final round to became the fifth Korean to win the event after Grace Park (2004), Yoo Sun-young (2012), Park In-bee (2013) and Ryu So-yeon (2017).
She is the 15th woman from South Korea to win a major, the most of any country other than the United States, and the victory is projected to see her top the world rankings.
""I had a great round and a great week. I felt nervous today but I just tried to keep myself calm,"" said Ko.
After her lead had been reduced to one shot with three holes to play following two quick bogeys Ko responded like a true champion, a perfectly-judged 10-foot birdie putt at the 16th proving the decisive blow at Mission Hills .
She clinched in style with another birdie at the last for a two-under-par 70, bursting into tears when the putt fell.
""My caddie told me on the 18th that I had a two-shot lead and to not worry, just enjoy it,"" Ko said.
""So many Korean players had a great tournament, and it's a real honor for me to win.""
Ko finished at 10-under 278, while Lee carded 70 for second place on seven-under, a shot ahead of American Lexi Thompson (67).
Kim In-kyung, who started the day in second place, fell out of contention with a double-bogey at the 11th, where her ball got stuck up a tree, forcing her to take a penalty stroke.
She shot 74 and tied for fourth with Spaniard Carlota Ciganda, five shots behind Ko.
The 23-year-old Ko said she had been dreaming of winning the event for five years and had always wanted to make the traditional winner's jump into Poppie's Pond.
""I always think about when I can go in that pond,"" she said. ""That's today.""
Despite the distractions and pressure of leading a major on a Sunday, Ko said she got over the line by trusting her swing.
""I just focused on my swing, on the putting, that's why I win this week,"" she said.
""I won. I can believe it now.""

(Reuters) - Ko Jin-young surged from behind to earn a one-stroke lead over Kim In-kyung that could have been higher were it not for some late trouble in the third round of the ANA Inspiration in California on Saturday.
The 23-year-old carded a four-under-par 68 on the difficult Mission Hills course in Rancho Mirage to reel in overnight leader Kim in the first women's major of the season.
Even a double-bogey at the par-three 14th could not dent Ko's positive outlook after she posted an eight-under 208 total with one round remaining.
""I had a great round still,"" she smiled.
While Ko played a great front nine and an average back nine, it was the opposite for Kim, whose four-shot lead starting the day turned into a four-stroke deficit at the turn.
Kim steadied after her double-bogey at the ninth to shoot a 73, however, playing a bogey-free back nine and finishing in style by sinking a six-foot birdie at the last that left her nipping at the heels of her fellow South Korean.
The 18th is the same hole where Kim missed a one-foot putt in the final round that cost her victory in 2012 in one of the most dramatic moments in major history.
""I played quite well on the back nine. I'm surprised I'm still close to the lead,"" said Kim, who eventually put her disappointment behind her to win a different major, the 2017 Women's British Open.
Another Korean, Lee Mi-hyang (68), was boosted by a hole-in-one from 181 yards at the 17th and jumped into a share of third with American Danielle Kang (70), three shots from the lead.
Ko reeled off six birdies in her first 10 holes and surged to a four-stroke lead until disaster struck at the 14th.
The 124-yard hole required no more than a flick with a wedge, but she struck the ball a little heavy and it failed to clear the pond guarding the green.
Ko dropped two shots and gave renewed hope to her pursuers, who had been watching helplessly in the proverbial rear-view mirror as the Korean threatened to run away with it.
But world number five Ko, imbued with self-belief on the back of recent hot form that has taken her to the top of the LPGA money list, displayed composure beyond her years to keep a positive attitude.
""I'm not robot,"" she said. ""I'm human. I don't think about bad things.
""This course is really hard, so anybody can miss a shot.""

AUGUSTA, Georgia — With the successful staging of the Augusta National Women's Amateur on Saturday, the home of the Masters removed a little more of the stain left by decades of gender discrimination.
But more polish will be needed if one of the world's most exclusive clubs hopes to clean the slate entirely.
""You are now part of history of Augusta National along with all the great Masters champions who have been right here in this Butler Cabin,"" said Augusta National chairman Fred Ridley as he presented the winner's trophy to Jennifer Kupcho.
The fact is, however, that women have long been a part of the history of Augusta National, albeit the dark chapter of exclusion.
Founded by Bobby Jones and Clifford Roberts and opened for play in January 1933, Augusta National was a private sanctuary for some of the world's most powerful white men and for decades immune to outside influences and pressures.
Ron Townsend became the first African-American member in 1990 but it would be another two decades before women were admitted with former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and financier Darla Moore allowed through the doors in 2012.
While the pace remains glacial, change has nonetheless crept into the Augusta DNA.
Club membership is top secret but it is believed that four to six of the 300 or so members are women and have one of the iconic green jackets hanging in their lockers.
Augusta National also hosts the hugely popular Drive, Chip and Putt Championship for both boys and girls and has now put its name and branding muscle to a women's tournament.
The images of women competing at a club where they had previously been denied entry was a powerful one that was universally applauded.
Some, like activist Martha Burk, who in 2003 led a protest against Augusta National's men only policy, remain skeptical. She described the event as a ""baby step"" and ""tokenism"".
Certainly it was an emotional day for golfing greats Nancy Lopez, Pak Se-ri, Lorena Ochoa and Annika Sorenstam, who took part in a ceremonial tee shot then watched as 30 young women seized an opportunity that had never been open to them.
""When we were talking I was tearing up,"" said Lopez. ""I was trying to hold back tears because there's so much pride involved in this.
""It was just a tremendous feeling to be there and represent amateur golf, professional golf and what golf stands for here at Augusta National.""
""GREAT MOTIVATION""
There was no downplaying the significance of the moment for Lorena Ochoa, who compared it to golf being played at the Olympics.
""It's going to be a great motivation for the new generations,"" she said.
""This is as big as a tournament that you have in your mind -- the U.S. Amateur, or the Olympics -- that you dream that you want to win.""
Without the Augusta National name attached to it, a tournament of this type would have been one watched by no more than a handful of family and friends.
Instead women's amateur golf on Saturday found itself in the sporting spotlight.
The final round was broadcast live on national television and a gallery worthy of a major tournament descended on the course to witness a bit of history.
While the golfing world was all but silent in 2003 when Burk was pushing for change, top men's players were squarely behind the women on Saturday.
Masters champion Bubba Watson, wearing his green jacket, watched from the first tee, while others like Rory McIlroy and Jack Nicklaus offered support on social media.
While Augusta has put its name to the tournament, only one round was played at the iconic course and the question remains as to what happens next for women's golf and Augusta National.
""This is an historic moment, and hopefully they will continue to carry the torch, and who knows what opportunities will come 10, 15 years from now,"" said Sorenstam. ""This is just the beginning.
""We are trying to increase the interest in the game of golf, and tournaments like this will certainly do it.
""I've never seen so much exposure for a tournament, and to see these girls come up here and step it up and have so much fun and enjoy it, I mean, this is a dream come true.""

RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. — Let other players take dead aim at titles and trophies. Jin Young Ko is finding success by directing her focus elsewhere.
“I want to be the happiest player on the golf course,” Ko said.
Ko, the latest star in South Korea’s bright constellation, burst into tears Sunday after closing with a two-under-par 70 to win the ANA Inspiration. It was her second L.P.G.A. title in less than a month and her first major championship.
Ko, who posted a 72-hole total of 10-under 278, finished three strokes ahead of her compatriot Mi Hyang Lee, who carded a final-round 70. Lexi Thompson, a former champion, shot a 67 for third, four strokes back.
For Ko, 23, happiness was a 15-foot birdie putt on the 72nd hole, after which she collapsed into the embrace of her caddie, David Brooker, who has guided three players to this championship.
“We are a really good team,” Ko said.
Ko capped her win by leaping into Poppie’s Pond with Brooker by her side.
Brooker said he was approached last year by an intermediary sent to gauge his interest in caddying for Ko. Brooker had worked with golfers who had played competitive rounds with her, so he had seen Ko’s game up close and was impressed with her driving accuracy and self-possession.
But he had an agreement to work for Paula Creamer, a 12-time winner worldwide, through the end of last season, her 14th as a professional. At the end of 2018, after Ko was named the L.P.G.A.’s top rookie, Brooker made the switch.
In her first six starts with Brooker on her bag, Ko has five top-3 finishes, including two victories. Her final-round scoring average is 66.83 strokes. It is a tossup as to who is the hottest player on the planet: Ko or the men’s world No. 3, Rory McIlroy, who has seven top-9 finishes, including one victory, in seven starts in 2019.
The 23-year-old Ko could not have asked for a more capable Sherpa than Brooker to help her plant her name at the top of the ANA Inspiration leader board. He entered the week having made 16 caddie appearances since 1997 at Mission Hills Country Club and two celebratory leaps into Poppie’s Pond, with Grace Park in 2004 and Lorena Ochoa in 2008.
Brooker knows the greens like his backyard, which is why Ko trusted him to read many of her putts.
“He helps me all the time on the green or the fairways,” she said.
Brooker’s guidance can be more subtle. After Ko played in the afternoon Friday and signed for a 71, she said she wanted to spend what little daylight remained working on her swing. Brooker talked her out of it, explaining that the gusting wind would make any range work counterproductive.
He suggested that she spend the time instead on her main area of emphasis during the off-season: chipping and putting.
“We are really good team,” Ko said.
Ko has four L.P.G.A. titles — and 14 over all — since she turned pro in 2013. Before earning her L.P.G.A. membership, Ko starred on the Korean L.P.G.A. tour. She was playing on her homeland circuit in 2015 when she took a three-stroke lead into the final round of her first major start, the Women’s British Open.
Ko, then 19, finished second to her compatriot Inbee Park.
And though that runner-up finish offered validation that her game stacked up well against the best, she said last year that she was hesitant to jump headlong to the L.P.G.A.
Before a tournament in Seoul last October, Ko said she engaged in considerable “soul searching” before she decided to leave home to compete on the American-based tour. Unlike many of her countrywomen, Ko does not maintain a residence in the United States.
“She doesn’t want a base over here,” Brooker said.
Ko’s homing instincts remind him of Ochoa, who was the women’s world No. 1 when she retired at 28 because she could no longer bear to be apart from her family and away from her native Mexico for long stretches.
“I don’t think she’s going to have one of those 20-year careers,” Brooker said. “I could see her playing out here five or six years and then retiring to have a family. She is not motivated by money, she’s not motivated by titles. She just wants to have fun.”
Ko can find the hilarity in courting disaster. On Saturday, she began the day four strokes off the lead, raced to a five-stroke advantage after 10 holes, then gave most of it back with a double bogey at No. 14 and a bogey at No. 15. After she used a pitching wedge to hit her tee shot into the water at the par-3 14th, Ko playfully rested her head on Brooker’s shoulder, sighed and said, “Oh, what have I done?”
Her third-round wobble proved instructive for Ko, who kept calm when she smelled the whiff of disaster on her back nine Sunday. After bogeys on the 13th and 15th holes whittled her lead over Lee to a single stroke, Ko rebounded with a birdie on the par-3 16th to give herself breathing room.
“She is just so smart for her age,” Brooker, said. “She knows what she’s doing out there.”

Seven years after missing a 1-foot putt on the final hole of regulation and losing a playoff, In-Kyung Kim was back on top at the ANA Inspiration.
Kim, a 30-year-old South Korean, shot a seven-under-par 65 in mostly calm morning conditions on Friday at Mission Hills in Rancho Mirage, Calif., to take a three-stroke second-round lead over Katherine Kirk in the first L.P.G.A. major of the year.
“Every stage, every passage of life has meaning to it and serves some purpose to it,” Kim said. “I’m just here doing my best.”
In 2012, Kim missed the short par putt to fall into a playoff and lost when Sun Young Yoo birdied the first extra hole. Kim struggled with the loss before finally ending a long victory drought late in the 2016 season in China. Her confidence renewed, she won three times the next year, capped by a major victory in the Women’s British Open.
“Sometimes winning is great, but for me as an athlete, you want to see some progress in your game,” Kim said. “That’s what I’m focusing on at the moment. That gives me joy. Anything else really is just a bonus, an extra.”
On Friday on the tree-lined layout toughened by thick, dewy rough, tighter fairways and some longer holes, Kim birdied all four of the par-5 holes and played a nine-hole stretch in the middle of the round in six under. After three-putting the par-4 seventh for her first bogey in 25 holes, she saved par on the par-3 eighth with an 8-footer and closed the round with an 8-foot birdie putt on the par-4 ninth to reach eight-under 136.
“I had makable putts that went in,” Kim said. “Yesterday, I also had a lot of opportunities, but in the afternoon, when the wind blows on the back nine, you can’t really be too aggressive to the flag.”
Kirk, a 37-year-old Australian, bogeyed the final two holes in a 68.
“I think my best golf is still ahead of me, which is nice to say at 37,” said Kirk, who won the last of her three tour titles in 2014. “All the experience, too, that I have had, I can use to that my advantage or at least try to use it to my advantage.”
Ally McDonald, the first-round leader, and Jin Young Ko were four strokes back. Lexi Thompson, the 2014 champion, shot 72, leaving her five strokes back with top-ranked Sung Hyun Park (70), Charley Hull (69), Jing Yan (71) and Danielle Kang (69).
TEXAS OPEN
Si Woo Kim made a hole in one on the 16th role to maintain his lead after two rounds in San Antonio. Kim, the 2017 Players Championship winner, has a four-shot lead over six players, including Rickie Fowler and Jordan Spieth. Fowler led on the back nine until making consecutive bogeys late in the round.

RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. — Jin Young Ko won the ANA Inspiration on Sunday at Mission Hills for her first major title and second victory in three weeks.
Ko closed with a 2-under 70 in hot and mostly calm conditions for a three-stroke victory over Mi Hyang Lee. She celebrated with the traditional winner's leap into Poppie's Pond.
After bogeys on 13 and 15 cut her lead to a stroke, Ko made a 6-foot birdie putt on the par-4 16th and closed with a 15-foot birdie putt on the par-5 18th.
Ko finished at 10-under 278. The 23-year-old South Korean won for the fourth time on the LPGA Tour, completing a desert sweep after taking the Founders Cup in Phoenix. She leads the money list and has five top-three finishes in six events this year.
Ko also gave caddie David Brooker his third victory in the event. The Englishman also leaped into Poppie's Pond with Grace Park in 2004 and Lorena Ochoa in 2008.
Lee parred the final six holes in a 70.
A stroke ahead of playing partner In-Kyung Kim entering the round, Ko had a three-stroke lead at the turn and faced little pressure until stumbling with the bogeys on 13 and 15. Her drive on the par-4 13th bounded down the fairway and jumped into the thick right rough, and her long approach ended up short of the green in the left rough. After missing a 12-foot birdie putt on the par-3 14th, she hit into the left greenside bunker on the par-4 15th and missed a 12-foot par try.
Lexi Thompson was third at 6 under after a 67.
Kim closed with a 74 to tie for fourth at 5 under with Carlota Ciganda. The 30-year-old South Korean lost a chance to win the event seven years after missing a 14-inch putt on the final hole of regulation and losing on the first hole of a playoff.
Ciganda finished with a 68.
PGA TOUR
SAN ANTONIO (AP) — Corey Conners won the Texas Open as Monday qualifier for his first PGA Tour title and a sport in the Masters.
The first Monday qualifier to win on the tour in nine years, the Canadian birdied three of the final five holes for his second straight 6-under 66 and a two-stroke victory over Charley Hoffman. Conners finished at 20-under 268 at TPC San Antonio.
Hoffman, the 2016 Texas Open winner, had weekend round of 64 and 67.
Ryan Moore closed with a 64, a shot off the course record, to finish third at 17 under.
PGA TOUR CHINA
SANYA, China (AP) — Officials at the Sanya Championship said Sunday that 28-year-old Malaysian golfer Arie Irawan died in his hotel room from ""apparent natural causes,"" and the PGA Tour Series-China canceled the final round of the tournament.
American Trevor Sluman led after 54 holes with an 18-under total of 198 and was declared winner of the tournament. Three Americans — Matt Gilchrest, Max McGreevy and Michael Perras — were tied for second, two strokes behind.
The PGA Tour Series-China said in a statement that Irawan missed the 36-hole cut Friday in the tournament at Sanya Yalong Bay Golf Club. It said the official coroner's report had not been completed.
""Out of respect for the family, officials canceled the final round of the Sanya Championship ... it's a true tragedy what has happened. Sometimes, though, things happen in life that are bigger than a sporting event,"" the tour said.

It is hard to imagine Augusta without Whitey Lester, a downtown fixture for decades and the city’s last strip-club impresario.

AUGUSTA, Ga. — “Folks,” the radio host wrote on his Facebook page, “reports of Whitey Lester’s death were apparently incorrect.”
It was just before Christmas, and the host, Austin Rhodes, was in the awkward position of
retracting
his on-air announcement about James Lester, who is known to everyone in Augusta as Whitey — and who remains very much alive.
It was a cringe-worthy error. But it also set off a mini-explosion of civic speculation about what Augusta, derided as “Disgusta” by detractors, might eventually be like without Mr. Lester, downtown’s very last strip-club impresario, the man whose businesses have for decades offered a lubricious counterpoint to the Masters Tournament, the hallowed yearly pilgrimage for golf fans hosted by the Augusta National Golf Club that begins this week.
Bartenders, strippers, real estate speculators, golf fans, preachers and politicians — they are all wondering what a post-Whitey Lester world might look like, and whether his clubs really would go with him.
Despite reports that Mr. Lester, who is in his mid-70s, has been in ill health, his son, Butch Lester, said in a brief interview that his father was nowhere near death, and he lamented that so much seemed to turn on the matter.
“That’s a lot of fuss for one man living or dying,” he said.
But it is hard to imagine the town without him. It was Mr. Lester who was responsible for the regionally famous striptease act known as The Snake Lady, an unholy pretzel of human and reptilian flesh that titillated many a golfer, soldier and late-teenage boy.
The dancer and a boa constrictor or two would emerge with the “Jaws” theme playing. A voice would announce a visitor from the “Devil’s den.”
He was the obvious
go-to quote
for The New York Post in 2010 when it trumpeted the 19th-hole hot-cha-cha that has long defined Augusta’s relationship with its famous golf tournament.
For years, Mr. Lester was also a headline-generating juggernaut for the local paper. He was the man who defied Bible Belt convention and survived a career in the cross hairs of evangelical Christians, prudish city officials, and even — in that odd way that the long putt of history sometimes breaks — an assistant United States attorney general named Robert S. Mueller III.
These days, according to his critics, Mr. Lester is also standing in the way of progress. His detractors contend that his two strip clubs along Broad Street, the Discotheque Lounge and Vegas Showgirls, are the last seedy obstacles hindering a downtown revitalization that might finally
help Augusta
shed its reputation as a sort of unglamorous urban crust around the sparkling green geode that is the Augusta National.
“We don’t want to continue to be the butt of jokes,” said Matt Aitken, a former member of the city-county commission and a real estate agent who has a number of properties listed near Mr. Lester’s clubs. “We want to be on the cutting edge of economic prosperity, and to be cool.”
A former mill town of 200,000 people about a two-hour drive east of Atlanta, Augusta has waited a long time for its makeover. Its urban core suffered more than most, not only from suburbanization, but
fire
,
floods
and a bitter 1970
race riot
. For decades, the downtown was defined by empty storefronts, pawn shops, and places like the Discotheque, the more famous of Mr. Lester’s clubs.
But now, finally, there is energy. There is a fledgling tech sector, helped along
by the planned move
of the United States Army’s Cyber Command headquarters from Virginia to nearby Fort Gordon. There is a handsome new $40 million convention center and a lovingly restored 1940 theater. There are pedestrians. There is a restaurant on Broad Street that serves quail bisque and pork belly rillette.
It all starts to taper off the closer one gets to the block with the strip joints, to the chagrin of the real estate agents dreaming of lofts and coffee shops. That block “is like a big missing tooth in the whole city,” said Jonathan Aceves, an agent and head of the neighborhood association for Olde Town, the residential area just to the east.
But the fate of that block of Broad Street and the mortality of Mr. Lester are tangled like woman and snake. The law made it so. In 1994, when six strip clubs were operating downtown, city officials made it illegal for nude clubs to serve alcohol. But they allowed the owners of the existing clubs, including Mr. Lester, to keep their alcohol licenses until the clubs closed or the owner died.
And so everybody waits.
They do not mean anything personal by it. But “people made business decisions based on the fact that these clubs would eventually close,” said Joe Edge, president of Sherman & Hemstreet, the company where Mr. Aitken works.
Augusta is the birthplace of the Southern Baptist Convention and, predictably, many have wanted Mr. Lester gone. In 1986, the mayor at the time, Charles A. DeVaney, was livid when a photo book meant to celebrate America’s cities — and sponsored by the United States Conference of Mayors — used a picture of the Discotheque to illustrate the city.
“Savannah gets the river, Macon a beautiful fountain and Augusta gets a nightspot that advertises a snake lady,” Mr. DeVaney complained.
In 1991, city leaders, still on the warpath, passed a law that banned nude dancing in clubs that sold alcohol. But the Discotheque management filed a court challenge and got an injunction, and the Georgia Supreme Court eventually ruled the law unconstitutional.
The next year, Mr. Lester faced his biggest test when he was indicted on four counts of underpaying federal income tax, part of a four-year investigation into what federal officials believed was an illegal gambling operation being run out of the Discotheque and a cavernous pool hall Mr. Lester owns next door called Riverfront Pub & Sports.
According to court documents, Mr. Mueller authorized the local United States attorney’s office to apply for an order allowing the wiretap of Mr. Lester’s office. The Discotheque and the pool hall were seized and padlocked by federal officials on a Friday morning in February. The authorities also seized hundreds of thousands of dollars — and hauled away the snakes.
More than a dozen people pleaded guilty to gambling charges as part of the inquiry. But the civil and criminal cases against Mr. Lester went nowhere. His properties were returned to him on April 3, just before the start of that year’s Masters Tournament.
Benjamin E. Nicholson V, one of Mr. Lester’s lawyers at the time, said that Mr. Lester was relieved to open just before the crush of Masters traffic. “Whitey had a contingent of Japanese that would spend a million bucks at the Masters,” Mr. Nicholson recalled, “and that made his year.”
Mr. Nicholson recalled that one snake died in federal custody and taxpayers compensated Mr. Lester handsomely for it.
When it comes to the local power structure, Mr. Lester has always counted powerful friends among his enemies. Few were surprised when, in 2012, he served as
an honorary pallbearer
at the funeral of the longtime local sheriff. And few were surprised when, in the run-up to this year’s Masters Tournament, city officials briefly considered a proposal that would allow Mr. Lester to pass his license down to family members.
When Mr. Edge caught wind of the proposal, he raised hell, and filed an online petition opposing it. It garnered 1,500 signatures and the idea went nowhere.
While it is legal to operate a strip club beyond downtown in Augusta’s industrial zones, none have opened because of a prohibition on liquor licenses. But this week, amid concerns that
tourism might be impacted
by a dearth of strip clubs, Augusta commissioners agreed to lift the prohibition. It was not immediately clear whether the Lester family would move their businesses.
On a recent afternoon at the Riverfront Pub, an employee eating chicken fingers at the bar said that Mr. Lester was not available for comment. The place was covered with photos reflecting a life in the nimbus of a certain kind of fame.
One photo featured Mr. Lester, bearded and smiling and looking like a roadie for a Southern rock band, next to the basketball legend Scottie Pippen. There were photos of gamblers and golfers and expert billiard players named Weenie Beanie and Cornbread Red. There was a photo of Muhammad Ali, signed by the legend: “To Mighty Whitey,” it says. “Good luck.”
Later that night at the Discotheque, Gina Virella, 32, a dancer, said she was studying to be a nurse. She was not too worried about her future. Some of the other dancers, she said, would have to move out of town when the place closed.
There was trap music on the sound system, and a framed newspaper article from the day Mr. Lester beat the feds.
There was also a framed cartoon that showed a lady from the local chamber of commerce with brochures on all of the attractions Augusta wants its visitors to see.
“Yeah those places sound great,” a bug-eyed male visitor tells her, “But what I’m really looking for is the famous Discotheque!!!”

(Reuters) - England's Meghan MacLaren finished second in the inaugural Jordan Mixed Open on Saturday, two strokes behind Daan Huizing of the Netherlands.
MacLaren, a Ladies European Tour winner, held a two-stroke lead going into the third round but ended at 14 under after a closing 72 as Huizing carded 68 to finish 16 under par.
The event held at the Ayla Golf Club in Aqaba was the first professional tournament in which men and women competed against each other for the same prize.
MacLaren, who started with two rounds of 65, struggled in the final round as she bogeyed the sixth and 10th holes before double-bogeying the 11th.
""I'm obviously pretty disappointed not to win this week, having been in such a good position,"" MacLaren said. ""But it was still an honor to be here and represent women's golf alongside two other great tours.""
Huizing was delighted with his victory.
""It's a big moment for me,"" Huizing said. ""I've had a rough time at home recently so this is a really sweet way to prove to myself that I've got it.
""I think it's an historical event. It's a different vibe and very special to be the first winner and I hope it's something that can be continued in the future.
""Meghan, thank you very much for the great battle today. You played great.""
Forty professionals and one amateur player each from the Challenge Tour, the over-50s Tour and the Ladies European Tour were in the field, were playing for a prize fund of about $400,000.

Ally McDonald made a 5-foot birdie putt on the final stroke of the first round on Thursday to take the lead in the ANA Inspiration.
McDonald shot a four-under-par 68 at Mission Hills in Rancho Mirage, Calif., playing in the last group of the day off the first tee. The tree-lined course was made more difficult with thick rough, tighter fairways and some lengthened holes.
She birdied all four par-5 holes, the last in fading light on the water-guarded 18th.
“I just drove the ball really well,” McDonald said. “Gave myself a lot of opportunities to make good approach shots into the green.”
Only 28 of the 112 players broke par in the tournament, the first L.P.G.A. major championship of the year, with McDonald and the other afternoon starters facing gusts. She had a one-stroke lead over the 2014 champion, Lexi Thompson; Jin Young Ko; Hyo Joo Kim; and Linnea Strom. Thompson, Ko and Kim played in calmer morning conditions, but with the thick rough wet from dew.
McDonald, 26, played at Mississippi State after becoming the only female player to win the state boys’ high school championship. She had made only two previous starts this season, her third on the tour. She tied for 58th two weeks ago in Phoenix in the Founders Cup and missed the cut last week in Carlsbad.
“I think in this position that I’ve never been in, it’s so easy to get ahead of yourself,” McDonald said. “For me, I’m just going to take it easy. I know that on the very first day, a great round is awesome, but there is so much more golf left to play.”
McDonald birdied the last three holes on the front nine and added another on the par-5 11th. She gave back a stroke on the par-3 14th before pulling ahead on 18.
Strom, also playing in the afternoon, made a 25-foot birdie putt on the par-3 17th, with the pin on the far right side, to reach four under. She then bogeyed the 18th after hitting her drive over the right-side cart path and under a tree. Strom was making her fifth start in her first season on the LPGA Tour.
“I know it’s a tough course, but there are some birdies out there,” said Strom, a former Arizona State player from Sweden.
Thompson birdied the final two holes, hitting to a foot on 18 after her caddie, Benji Thompson, talked her into a lower-lofted wedge.
“I wanted to hit my 50 degree, which was max what the yardage was,” Thompson said. “He was like, ‘No, just chip the 47, take the spin off, in case a gust does come up.’ Sure enough, it did. Just chipped up there. I was like, ‘Thank you so much, Benji.’ ”
Jessica Korda had seven birdies in an adventurous 70. She also had a double bogey after driving out of bounds on the par-4 third and three bogeys.
“A serious roller coaster,” Korda said. “Glad I got off it on 18.”
WOMEN’S PLAY AT AUGUSTA
The N.C.A.A. champion Jennifer Kupcho held on for a one-under-par 71 for a one-shot lead over Maria Fassi of Mexico in the Augusta National Women’s Amateur, leaving her one round away from a chance to become the first woman to win a tournament at the home of the Masters.
TEXAS OPEN
Si Woo Kim birdied five of his final eight holes for a six-under-par 66 and a one-shot first-round lead over four others in San Antonio. Ricky Fowler and Jordan Spieth were part of a group that was another shot back in the event, the last on the PGA Tour before the Masters.

AUGUSTA, Ga. — Rory McIlroy feels as prepared as ever for the Masters.
He is spending more time with his nose in a book than with his hands on a putter. ""The Greatest Salesman in the World"" by Og Mandino is among the best books he has read in the last year. He has been working with Brad Faxon on his putting, but their best sessions take place over a cup of coffee.
His morning routine goes beyond stretching. There is juggling — yes, juggling — meditation and mind training.
""I was watching the Women's Amateur over the weekend and I saw a few women on the range juggling, so it's catching on,"" McIlroy said Tuesday. ""How many balls can I juggle? Just three. I'm a rookie.""
It's all geared toward becoming a complete person.
And whether it makes him a complete player by capturing the only major he has yet to win, well, that would be a bonus.
McIlroy is in the early stages of this process, and it's hard to argue with the results, even if results don't drive him like they once did. He has yet to finish out of the top 10 in his seven tournaments this year, which includes a victory at The Players Championship, the next best thing to a major.
But that green jacket is a powerful pull on the mind, and McIlroy has reason to believe he can fit comfortably into one.
He famously lost a four-shot lead with an 80 in the final round in 2011 but, even at age 21, showed enough resolve and enormous talent to win the U.S. Open in the very next major. He played in the final group on Saturday in 2016 with Jordan Spieth until falling back with a 77. He played in the final group Sunday last year with Patrick Reed, three shots behind, and fell out of the mix before reaching the back nine.
""I know I've played well enough and I've shot enough good scores around here over the years that if I can put my best effort forward, I'm going to have a good chance to do well here,"" McIlroy said. ""But it's definitely different. My mind set is a little different in terms of ... I'm still practicing. I'm still getting better. I'm not getting ahead of myself, not thinking about the tee shot on Thursday or thinking about what is to come this week.
""I would dearly love to win this tournament one day,"" he said. ""If it doesn't happen this week, that's totally fine, I'll come back next year and have another crack at it. But I'm happy with where everything is — body, mind, game.""
No one was particularly happy with Mother Nature on Tuesday, as more storms arrived that shut the course down for about three hours in the morning and pounded an already soft Augusta National with rain before giving way to patches of sunshine in the afternoon.
Wednesday is a short day of practice because of the Par 3 Tournament.
The curtain raises Thursday with a host of players capable of getting in McIlroy's way of joining golf's most elite club. Only five other players have captured the career Grand Slam — Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods.
This is McIlroy's fifth crack at the Masters with a Grand Slam at stake. In the modern era of the Grand Slam that dates to 1960, no one went more than three years between the third and final leg.
Phil Mickelson is in a similar situation, if not worse. He lacks only the U.S. Open — he has a record six silver medals — and is 0 for 4 since the Grand Slam has come into view. He also believes McIlroy's game is at a high level.
""That's always a challenge when you put so much emphasis on playing a particular event, but it's also the chance to bring out your best,"" Mickelson said. ""And he's had such a phenomenal start to the year, he's been playing such great golf consistently week in and week out, I think contending will be a given. He'll be in contention. You just need those little breaks ... that push you over the winner's circle and that's probably all that he's waiting for this week.
""You can't force it. It just has to happen.""
The books McIlroy has been reading are recommendations from successful businesspeople. Along with Mandino's book, he liked Ryan Holiday's ""The Obstacle is the Way"" and ""Ego is the Enemy,"" and he's just now starting on the biography of Steve Jobs.
In an interview at the Match Play, he was asked if he was spending more time on his golf or on his attitude.
""Life,"" he said. ""I hit balls once last week. That was it. So much of this game is mental. It's taken me a while to get to this point, but the proof is there of what I've been doing, the way I've been playing, how I've been approaching the game.""
So what happens if he's right in the mix Sunday afternoon, facing the most dynamic back nine in golf, the coveted green jacket there for the taking? What if that Sunday afternoon includes Woods, who eliminated McIlroy at the Match Play in a finish so irritating that McIlroy left without speaking to the media?
""I haven't thought about it,' McIlroy said. ""I guess there's a lot of bridges to cross until we get to that point.""

RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. — Jin Young Ko turned a four-stroke deficit into a five-stroke lead in 10 holes at the ANA Inspiration. She nearly gave it all back, setting up a final-round shootout in the first major championship of the golf season.
Ko ended up with a one-shot advantage over second-round leader In-Kyung Kim, shooting a 4-under 68 in unexpected calm conditions Saturday at Mission Hills to reach 8-under 208.
Kim birdied the par-5 18th for a 73, giving herself a chance to win the event seven years after missing a 14-inch putt on the final hole of regulation and losing to Sun Young Yoo on the first hole of a playoff.
Mi Hyang Lee and Danielle Kang were 5 under. Lee had a hole-in-one on the par-3 17th in a 68. Kang shot 70.

AUGUSTA, Georgia — Jennifer Kupcho struck a blow for gender equality and entered golf history books on Saturday when she was crowned Augusta National Women's Amateur champion by firing a final-round five-under 67 for a four-shot win over Maria Fassi.
Following the first women's competitive round played at Augusta National, it was a double celebration for Kupcho as she hoisted the silver and gold Tiffany-designed cup at a club that just seven years ago did not have a single woman member.
""You are now part of history of Augusta National along with all the great Masters champions who have been right here in this Butler Cabin,"" Augusta National chairman Fred Ridley said as he presented Kupcho with her trophy in the same location where the Masters champion is presented with the winner's green jacket.
With Augusta National set to host the Masters next week, Fassi and Kupcho proved that women can also produce nerve-jangling drama with a back-nine battle worthy of any major.
Kupcho's elation was mixed with relief as she struggled with a migraine and blurred vision from the eighth through 11th holes that threatened to scuttle her title hopes.
""I actually got a migraine on the eighth green and kind of over to the left I just couldn't see it was blurry,"" said Kupcho. ""I told my caddie I'm looking for you to read the putts and tell me where to hit it and I will do my best to hit it there.
""Amazing enough, I have gotten these migraines before so I knew the blurriness would go away and I would just have a headache. On the 11th tee was where it finally started to go away and I could finally see.""
The Masters is often decided on the back nine on a Sunday and that was the case for the women who played their final round on Saturday, as Kupcho played the final six holes in five under.
Showing why she is the world's top-ranked amateur, the 21-year-old carded birdies at 15, 16 and 18 along with a brilliant eagle on the par five 13th that wiped out Fassi's two stroke lead.
Opened for play in 1933, Augusta National became the private sanctuary for some of the world's most powerful men and it was almost 80 years before the club welcomed its first women members in 2012, former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and financier Darla Moore.
GREAT STAGES
After the opening two rounds of the 54-hole tournament were held at Champions Retreat in nearby Evans, the women finally got the opportunity to step on to one of the sport's great stages.
The first competitive round played by women at Augusta National attracted a large crowd but it was not the typical gallery seen at the Masters.
The crowd more resembled one you might find at a U.S. women's soccer game with plenty of teenage girls and mothers and fathers with children in tow.
While the sight of women battling for a trophy was new for Augusta National, so were the sounds as the galleries offered encouragement with shouts of ""Atta girl"" and ""Way to go girls"".
There were plenty of Augusta members in their iconic green jackets who mingled among the crowd cheering on the golfers while others offered support on social media.
""So cool seeing these women live out their dreams right now,"" tweeted Rory McIlroy, who will be in Augusta next week looking to complete a career grand slam.
Following a Masters tradition, the round began with ceremonial tee shots. LPGA greats Nancy Lopez, Pak Se-ri, Lorena Ochoa and Annika Sorenstam did the honors.
After American Anna Redding struck the first competitive shot, the focus shifted to Kupcho and Fassi, the two close friends and college rivals sharing an emotional hug before teeing off.
The two embraced again on the 18th green, promising more battles in the future.
""I did all I could, she played a great game she finished really strong and I am really proud of her and I know we are going to be battling for wins in the future,"" said Fassi. ""Yes we were competing against each other but we were friends before all of that.
""Making it at Augusta National, being the first time, it is just a dream come true.""

AUGUSTA, Georgia — A day after Augusta National crowned a first women's champion it was Kid's Day at the home of the Masters on Sunday, one of world's most exclusive clubs taking on an amusement park vibe.
Once the private sanctuary for some of world's richest and most powerful men, Augusta National shed some of its stodgy old boy image during a 24-hour goodwill blitz.
First the club hosted the final round of the inaugural Augusta National Women's Amateur championship on Saturday and then on Sunday it was invaded by 80 boys and girls between the ages of seven and 15 for the Drive, Chip and Putt National Championship.
The images of women competing at a club where just seven years ago they had been denied membership and the sight of smiling kids cavorting and playing for trophies on the 18th green stand in stark contrast to Augusta National's darker days when neither seemed particularly welcome.
Founded by Bobby Jones and Clifford Roberts and opened for play in January 1933, Augusta National for decades was unmoved by outside forces and events.
But it seems even at Augusta National things are a changing.
With Masters week set to kick off on Monday, there were few signs, aside from the presence of a few former champions in green jackets, that the year's first major was about to be contested as kids competed while others tumbled and cartwheeled down the fairway.
RULES RELAXED
The rules that will be strictly enforced next week - when no running will be allowed on the manicured landscape - were relaxed as youngsters playfully scurried around, with security personnel turning a blind eye.
""Everything seems to have evolved around here -- in a good way,"" Canadian Mike Weir, who will be making his 20th Masters start this year and won the Green Jacket in 2003, told Reuters.
""Sure, (it is) very different.
""This event the Drive, Chip and Putt has been going on a number of years so it is really cool to see the excitement on the kids' faces.
""I wasn't here yesterday but I did get to see a little bit of it and it looked like a great event. The young ladies really seemed very excited to be here and quite a finish as well.""
Jennifer Kupcho's four-shot victory over Maria Fassi on a course where women had never played a competitive round before Saturday was widely lauded as a watershed moment for women's golf.
The hope behind the Augusta National Women's Amateur is that it will inspire young players and one didn't have to look far on Sunday to see an immediate impact.
""It is so amazing, just the history of this place where there were no girls allowed and now there is a tournament for women,"" said Mia Cepeda, who competed in the girls 12-13 division of the Drive, Chip and Putt. ""It is definitely one of my goals.
""This is one thing but to actually play on the course would be just so super cool.""

(Reuters) - Canadian Corey Conners clinched an astonishing two-shot victory over American Charley Hoffman at the Texas Open on Sunday to punch the final ticket to the Masters.
Conners, ranked 196th in the world, compiled a crazy, rollercoaster six-under-par 66 that included 10 birdies in the final round at TPC San Antonio.
He followed four early birdies with four consecutive bogeys on the front nine before storming home with six birdies and three pars to claim his first PGA Tour title.
""It just doesn't seem real,"" Conners told reporters after finishing at 20-under 268 to secure his second shot at the Masters after playing as an amateur in 2015.
Hoffman birdied the par-five 18th to shoot 67 and claim second place, a shot ahead of fellow American Ryan Moore (64).
South Korean overnight leader Kim Si-woo (72) faded to equal fourth with American Brian Stuard (66) on 15-under.
""I've been close a few times and feel like I've learned a lot in those situations and that really helped today,"" said Conners, the 15th Canadian to win on Tour.
""I couldn't be more excited to get over the edge. There's so many perks that come with it.""
The 27-year-old from Ontario was so low on the pecking order that he was not even exempt into the Texas Open.
Instead, he had to run the gauntlet of a Monday qualifier, among 73 players competing for four spots.
Six players ended up in a playoff for the final berth, and Conners was the man to emerge triumphant and he went on to become the first Monday qualifier to win since 2010.
Conners started the final round a shot behind Kim, but powered to a four-shot lead after just five holes as the birdies flowed.
But what the golfing gods give, they also take away, and the Canadian lost those four strokes as quickly as he had gained them as Hoffman took the lead with a birdie at the ninth.
""Got off to a great start, birdied number five and walked to sixth tee thinking, 'wow, this is really awesome' and then reeled off four bogeys,"" Conners said.
""I didn't get too down on myself. I knew I was playing really well. It was nice to have a little break between nine and 10 and give myself a bit of a pep talk.""
Although Hoffman did not drop a shot on the back nine and picked up three more birdies, it that was not enough to stop a rampant Conners, whose putter was running hotter than a Texas summer as wife Mallory watched on nervously from the gallery.
Conners came to the last with a three-shot lead and held his nerve to book the final seat on the Sunday night charter flight to Augusta, where the first major championship of the year will tee off on Thursday.
""The last few holes are a bit of a blur,"" he said.
""Big change of plans. It was just going to be an off week but it's not now.""

PALM BEACH, Fla. — Behind the clipped hedges of President Trump’s sumptuous private clubs in South Florida, including his Mar-a-Lago estate where he has spent many getaway weekends, there has long been a built-in contradiction to the policy the president has repeatedly described as “America First.”
Many of his employees have foreign passports.
Romanians serve dinner in lavish banquet halls. South Africans tend to guests at the spa. Britons bake elegant pastries. Most are young people hired as guest workers on special visas, living over the winter high season in a gated community with a sand volleyball pit and a movie theater. In the mornings, they dress in trim uniforms and are chauffeured by van over a bridge to the luxury compound six miles away in Palm Beach.
But that’s only part of the Trump resort work force in South Florida.
Alongside the foreign guest workers and the sizable American staff is another category of employees, mostly those who work on the pair of lush golf courses near Mar-a-Lago. Not offered apartments, they have been picked up by Trump contractors from groups of undocumented laborers at the side of the road; hired through staffing companies that assume responsibility for checking their immigration status; or brought onto the payroll with little apparent scrutiny of their Social Security cards and green cards, some of which are fake.
That second pool of immigrant labor is an embarrassing reality for a president who has railed against undocumented immigrants, one his company is scrambling to erase.
Mr. Trump has long acknowledged that running the hospitality industry on a tight supply of American labor is extraordinarily difficult — the reason Mar-a-Lago has frequently turned to legal guest workers for jobs that typically span only, in the case of Florida, the pleasant winter months. “It’s very, very hard to get people,” he explained during the 2016 campaign. “But other hotels do the exact same thing.”
In the case of the Trump Organization, the hiring of some immigrant labor may be about to change: Facing growing questions about its employment of undocumented workers, the company has quietly begun to take steps to eliminate any remaining undocumented workers from its labor pool in South Florida.
In March, seven veteran maintenance workers at Trump National Jupiter, the golf club 18 miles north of Mar-a-Lago that Mr. Trump bought in 2012, were informed that the work force was being reorganized. Workers had until March 22 to provide proof that they were legally eligible to work in the United States, they were told.
One by one, the workers — from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico — began to depart. Only one of the seven was a legal resident.
“They got rid of me after so many years of hard work because I don’t have papers,” said Doroteo Hernández, 42, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico who worked for 10 years on the maintenance crew at Jupiter, one of Mr. Trump’s favorite golfing spots on his weekends at Mar-a-Lago.
Mr. Hernández, a diminutive man with a weather-beaten face and workman’s hands, said that in late March he handed over 11 well-worn, button-down shirts embroidered with his name and the name of the club, 11 pairs of khakis and a club cap to his supervisor, who praised him and gave him a farewell hug.
“I’m battling on,” said Mr. Hernández, who supports his parents and siblings in Mexico. “Everyone just wants to take care of their family.”
Similar
scenes have played out
at a number of Trump Organization golf properties since The New York Times first reported that two undocumented housekeepers had for several years
worked in proximity to Mr. Trump
at his golf property in Bedminster, N.J.
Additional laborers
working without legal authorization came forward at other Trump golf properties, some of them deliberately
kept off the lists
of workers vetted by the Secret Service.
The undocumented workers raise questions not only about the Trump Organization’s hiring practices, but also about security at Mar-a-Lago and the luxurious golf properties that surround it — recently subject to scrutiny after a woman carrying two Chinese passports and
a thumb drive containing malicious software
was detained on March 30 at Mar-a-Lago.
Though maintenance workers, drivers and painters from Mexico and Central America would not normally be thought of as security threats, the presence of workers with fraudulent identity documents poses additional complications in vetting those who may be in proximity to the president at his leisure properties in Florida and elsewhere.
In Palm Beach County, home to dozens of hotels, golf resorts and residential communities, there is a steady demand for menial labor, some of it performed by foreigners who come in on H-2B guest worker visas. The Trump Florida properties requested 148 of these immigrant workers for the 2018-19 season, an increase over most past years. This is one area of immigration that the Trump administration
has pushed to expand
.
Meanwhile, across the county, immigrant enclaves have grown in the shadows of multimillion-dollar homes — places where the streets are lined with much humbler homes, butcher shops called carnicerías, and money-order offices where on Fridays immigrants wire money home to relatives. Unlike those living in the gated complex, the immigrants here are mainly Central American, Mexican and Haitian.
A number of staffing company offices — discreet, sometimes with mirrored glass windows — are tucked into strip malls. Here, workers can submit applications to be placed on job sites, sometimes the same day.
Staffing companies were originally intended to serve as external human resource departments, supplying temporary workers and handling their paperwork, according to Richard Celler, an employment lawyer in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. But now, Mr. Celler said, “it’s morphed.” He said employers had come to run their regular workers through the companies to cut the cost of workers’ compensation insurance and to narrow their liability.
“It’s the outsourcing of labor,” he said.
There is another important advantage.
Greg Schell, a lawyer based in Lake Worth, Fla., who represents farmworkers and other migrant workers, said that as employers have faced increased scrutiny from federal authorities over hiring undocumented labor, they have turned to staffing companies, some of which engage in careful immigration verification, some of which do not. These companies enable many Florida farms and golf resorts, which can have difficulty finding legal workers, to maintain large work crews without assuming legal responsibility for their immigration status, Mr. Schell said.
“The whole concept is to have someone else bear the responsibility,” he said.
Not long ago, groundskeepers and golf maintenance workers were directly employed at the Trump properties in Florida and frequently moved between them, according to former employees. However, in recent years, the organization transferred the work crews at Mar-a-Lago and nearby golf courses over to Barnett Management, a staffing company with headquarters in West Palm Beach that specializes in supplying golf maintenance, landscaping, farm and nursery workers, as well as setup staff for events and banquets.
In late February, Jeff Payer, the Jupiter club’s golf course superintendent, called in Mr. Hernández and the six other maintenance workers who were still on the payroll of another staffing company, Ryvor Golf, the immigrant workers said. Mr. Payer informed them that they would be transferred to Barnett, which was already handling the majority of the club’s roughly three dozen golf maintenance workers and groundskeepers, they said.
“He told us, ‘You can keep working, we trust you and know your work,’” recalled Roberto Carlos Méndez, 29, a Guatemalan. Mr. Payer declined to be interviewed and did not respond to questions.
But in early March, several of the former workers said, a Barnett representative who visited the club said they could not stay on, telling them that only workers with legal immigration papers would be allowed to transfer to Barnett’s payroll.
“I spoke personally to the Barnett guy. He told me that, unfortunately, I didn’t qualify to stay at the club,” said Mr. Méndez, who had worked at the Jupiter property since sneaking across the border nearly four years ago.
In separate interviews, five of the workers offered the same account. All said they were in the country illegally and had been hired despite having phony identification cards and Social Security numbers and as recently as two-and-a-half years ago, during the 2016 presidential campaign. Florida law does not require employers to use the E-Verify electronic verification system to check employees’ documents, though some companies, including Barnett, use it voluntarily.
No one from the management at the Jupiter club, or at any of the Florida Trump properties, responded to interview requests for this article, nor did officials from the Trump Organization. But none of the immigrants doubted that club managers were aware all along that they were undocumented, and were disappointed to see them go.
“They knew immigrants working there are here illegally,” said Giovanni Velásquez, a 23-year-old from Guatemala who said he had been allowed to continue working as long as he did because he was needed. “The know-how that I have, the work I do, can’t be easily replaced. No American wants to do it.”
Mr. Méndez said that he spent 10 minutes with the Barnett representative trying to ascertain why the Ryvor workers were being let go while workers already on Barnett’s payroll, some of whom he believed were also undocumented, were untouched.
“I told him, ‘I don’t understand,’” he said. “He responded that going forward, they will not take people without papers.”
This transition to a greater reliance on staffing companies appeared to begin around 2016, former workers said, though it is not clear if there was any connection to Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign.
Barnett officials declined to discuss the recent staff moves at Jupiter, or any other matters. “Barnett Management complies with all federal laws and regulations with respect to the hiring of employees,” Corey Witzel, the general counsel for Barnett’s parent company, MVP Staffing, said in an email.
In addition to the workers who recently lost their jobs at the Jupiter club, around a dozen other undocumented workers at local pickup spots and a resource center for day laborers told The Times that they had worked stints at the golf club, brought in by contractors to install irrigation plumbing, spray insecticide and paint houses. One of them said he had worked there for years.
A man who gave only his first name, Santos, 31, said that “they give us a permisito” — a pass — “so we could go in.” He said he had worked nearly three years painting houses at the golf club starting in 2012.
A 24-year-old who also gave only his first name, Alfonso, said that he, too, worked at the Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter as part of a painting crew, and was allowed to continue there even after Mr. Trump became president. “Nothing changed with the election,” he said.
As the deadline approached for the undocumented maintenance workers at the Jupiter club to leave their jobs, many pondered their futures. Mr. Méndez, one of the Guatemalan immigrants, said that he was offered maintenance work at other golf clubs, but for less than the $11 hourly wage he made at Jupiter. “If we take a job at a golf club for less, we are moving backward instead of advancing,” he said.
Daniel Federico Gómez, 23, said he had not found a job, either, though he had started to train the replacements who would be taking the workers’ places at Jupiter.
Two days before the March 22 deadline, Mr. Gómez and Mr. Méndez were the last of the undocumented group still on the job.
Mr. Velásquez had found work at an Italian restaurant washing dishes for $10 an hour. “I have to start all over,” he said. “All my experience is on the golf course.”
As for Mr. Hernández, a friend found him a landscaping job. Sitting in his neat apartment after his second day of work, he was still not sure about his salary. Mr. Payer, the golf superintendent, had found work for him and his co-workers at another golf course, Mr. Hernández said, but it was too far away for someone like him, who cannot obtain a Florida driver’s license because he has no proof of legal residence.
On his last day at Jupiter, he returned every part of his tattered Trump uniform. “They cannot say I took a single thing that didn’t belong to me,” he said.
His boss, however, had insisted he keep the cap with the club logo.

DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. — LPGA founder and pioneering golfer Marilynn Smith has died at 89.
The LPGA Tour said she died Tuesday in Goodyear, Arizona, surrounded by family and friends. Smith last was seen in public March 24 at the Bank of Hope Founders Cup, greeting players as they walked off the 18th green.
Smith was one of the 13 founders of the LPGA Tour. Her 21 victories, two majors and endless support of her tour led to her induction into the World Golf Hall of Fame.
Commissioner Mike Whan said on the tour's website that Smith was his ""North Star and most importantly my friend.""
Smith was president of the LPGA from 1958 to 1960. In 1973, she became the first woman to work a PGA Tour event as a TV broadcaster.
The LPGA Tour began in 1950. The only surviving founders are now Shirley Spork and Marlene Bauer Hagge.

The president’s tax returns would provide insight into how much money he is making, or losing, each year, but they would not fully illuminate the sources of his wealth.
By
Susanne Craig
and
Jesse Drucker
Democrats are hoping that President Trump’s federal tax returns will serve as a Rosetta stone to unlock the secrets of his murky finances.
Mr. Trump, on the other hand, has spent the past three years refusing to divulge the returns and even dismissing them as boring.
Now, the fight over whether members of Congress have the right to see the president’s tax returns is intensifying. The House tax-writing committee has demanded them, and
late Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said his department would not comply with the request by the date set by the committee
. Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump repeated that he would not disclose his returns, falsely claiming that there is no law that gives Congress the authority to obtain them.
Mr. Trump is the first president in four decades to not publicly release his tax returns. The refusal — coupled with his continued ownership of a far-flung network of closely held businesses — has fanned suspicions that he has something to hide.
So, what might lawmakers find if they obtain Mr. Trump’s tax filings?
For starters, his recent returns could illuminate the sources of his income and any tax-avoidance strategies he may have used, but it would not fully decode the family’s personal and business finances.
Leaked pages of the president’s old tax returns and other financial documents already have shed light on his finances. They indicate that Mr. Trump most likely
avoided paying income taxes
for a number of years and that in other periods The New York Times found he
participated in fraudulent tax schemes
to minimize his tax bill. His federal ethics filings show hundreds of millions of dollars in outstanding loans and a business network owned through a web of corporate entities.
The House Ways and Means Committee last week requested six years of Mr. Trump’s personal tax returns, along with the returns filed by one of his trusts and seven subsidiaries he controls. They also asked for records of any audits.
The returns would partly reveal the sources of the president’s income, and whether his businesses are profitable. They would show how much, if anything, Mr. Trump has been paying in taxes and might show whether he has been aggressive in reducing his tax bills. They will show whether Mr. Trump has personally donated to charity.
The returns requested by the committee, however, would not fully answer longstanding questions about the identities of Mr. Trump’s business partners, the ultimate sources of his income or whether he is entangled with entities that have interests before his administration.
Even if Representative Richard E. Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts, who leads the committee, is successful, it does not mean the tax returns will become public. By law, they are supposed to remain solely in the hands of the committee; an unauthorized release would be a felony.
[Update: House chairman says treasury’s
reasons to withhold Trump’s tax returns
“lack merit.”]
Ever since he declared his candidacy, Mr. Trump — a self-proclaimed billionaire — has faced questions about whether he is exaggerating his wealth.
Mr. Trump has never substantiated his assertion that he is a billionaire, though he has
repeatedly made the claim
to banks and other institutions. The disclosure of his tax returns probably would not settle the debate over Mr. Trump’s net worth.
Tax returns do not provide lists of assets or liabilities, unless they generate income or deductions. Even then, the returns most likely would not provide values of those assets or liabilities.
Still, Mr. Trump’s full tax returns — his personal returns and the ones for all of the components of the Trump Organization — would give a sense of the profitability of his businesses.
The returns would also reveal whether his companies have taken a hit since he entered the White House. (Mr. Trump
has said he has lost vast amounts of money
since he became president.)
Mr. Trump for years ran the Trump Organization, a privately held company that manages real estate, golf resorts, brand and licensing deals and other interests. Much about the businesses’ finances remains unknown.
The federal ethics disclosures Mr. Trump has made about his holdings so far have been limited. For example, there is no requirement that he report the identities of investors who have put money into his businesses.
Mr. Trump acquired many properties, in particular golf courses, with cash, but where did that cash come from? Mr. Trump’s son Eric once told a journalist that the Trump Organization’s golf properties were paid for with Russian money. Eric Trump has denied making that statement.
While Mr. Trump’s federal filings have reported some outstanding loans, investments and income from each business, they do not include debts where he has a partial interest or older loans that have been paid off. In theory, the existence of those older loans — and the lenders behind them — could be disclosed on his historical tax returns because certain types of interest on debts can be tax-deductible.
In reality, much of that information is unlikely to be contained in the limited number of returns requested by Congress. The panel is seeking the returns for only a small number of Mr. Trump’s companies. But he controls hundreds of separate L.L.C.s that contain individual businesses, as varied as a particular building or the rights to license his name overseas. Each one of those businesses may file its own tax return, separate from the ones requested by the committee.
Mr. Trump owns and operates businesses in the United States and overseas. He earns revenue from golf club memberships, from leasing space in his buildings and from licensing deals to put the “Trump” name on other developers’ properties.
Mr. Trump’s government disclosure reports show ranges of how much revenue his various subsidiaries collect, as provided by Mr. Trump, but they do not indicate the companies’ overall profitability.
For example, his most recent government ethics report states that his Irish golf business reported revenue of $14 million in 2017. However, Irish regulators require that the golf subsidiary make its filings public. Those disclosures show the business actually lost about $2 million that year. Mr. Trump’s returns could provide further detail about the profitability of his other businesses. More broadly, his tax returns can be compared with the ethics disclosures to check the accuracy of the filings.
Mr. Trump’s personal tax returns will also itemize his stock- and bond-market transactions and people and institutions he is receiving income from, domestic and foreign. This would include income he has received from banks.
If Democrats get Mr. Trump’s taxes, they will be looking for any aggressive or illegal maneuvers — such as
the fraudulent tactics
he has used in the past.
Sophisticated tax filers use their returns to paint the picture of their finances they want the government to see. It usually takes a lot of digging to find out what is going on behind the numbers.
For example, as The New York Times reported last year, Mr. Trump and his siblings set up a sham corporation in the early 1990s to disguise millions of dollars in gifts from their parents.
In that case, The Times had access to far more than just tax returns:
It also relied on
confidential business filings, public records and information from sources to document the fraud.
At the time the article was published, a lawyer for the president, Charles J. Harder, said the allegations of fraud and tax evasion were 100 percent false, and highly defamatory.
What will be more immediately apparent in Mr. Trump’s tax returns is what sort of deductions he has used to reduce his tax bill, and how aggressively he has used them.
In 1995, for example, Mr. Trump paid no income tax, and records show he has not paid income tax in several other years.
The president has said he has avoided taxes because of the generous deductions given to real estate owners like himself. One deduction is depreciation, which permits real estate investors to deduct a portion of the cost of their buildings from their taxable income.
“I have a write-off. A lot of it is depreciation, which is a wonderful charge,”
he said during a presidential debate in 2016.
“I love depreciation.”

AUGUSTA, Ga. — Bryson DeChambeau believes science was at work late in the afternoon at Augusta National, creating a force in the atmosphere where big roars from great shots filter through the back nine.
An easier description: Another exciting finish at the Masters, this time on a Thursday.
Brooks Koepka got it started, adding to his reputation of playing his best golf in the majors. He rolled in a 20-foot putt birdie from behind the 12th green, the first of four straight birdies to take the lead. DeChambeau answered with four straight birdies at the end of his round, with two shots inches away from being even better.
His 8-iron on the par-3 16th grazed the edge of the cup. His 6-iron into the 18th was even better, so good that it rolled smack into the middle of the pin and bounced back an inch or two .
Both wound up in a share of the lead at 6-under 66.
""Absolutely, there is an energy and there is something in science that does talk about that,"" said DeChambeau, who has a scientific answer for everything. ""It's great to have momentum and great atmosphere and gets you all pumped up, creates adrenaline flow. ... I believe that's partially what happened today.""
They were one shot ahead of 48-year-old Phil Mickelson, who delivered thrills of his own.
Mickelson found some momentum after shots in the pine trees at No. 10 and in the water on No. 11, both leading to bogey when he thought it could have been worse. He answered with three birdies on the next four holes, including a shot into the 16th that stopped inches from the cup .
He had a 67, his best start since 2010, when he won his third green jacket.
""It looked like, after bogeying 10 and 11, that would kill some momentum. It was the other way around, because I made two great bogeys that should have and could have been doubles,"" Mickelson said. ""And then when I got to the holes that I could birdie, I took advantage of it with some good shots.""
Tiger Woods missed all the action. He played earlier in the round and methodically scored a solid 70. It was a good start for Woods in his quest to end 11 years without a major, and he was atop the leaderboard briefly until a late bogey. He sounded satisfied.
""I've shot this number and won four coats, so hopefully, I can do it again,"" said Woods, who slightly miscalculated. The last green jacket he won in 2005 began with a 74. The goal was to not fall too far behind early, and he is just four shots behind.
Rory McIlroy's bid for the last leg of the career Grand Slam began with a 73, which featured six bogeys.
""I made five birdies — that wasn't the problem,"" McIlroy said. ""I just made too many mistakes.""
Even more surprising to McIlroy was no one from the early starters took advantage of soft turf from recent rains.
""It's there for the taking, and I'm surprised someone hasn't run off,"" McIlroy said.
And that's right about when Koepka and DeChambeau took off.
""Honestly, I was hitting it great all day,"" DeChambeau said. ""Just an accumulation of great golf that finally showed in the score.""
He two-putted for birdie on the par-5 15th. He narrowly missed his first hole-in-one in competition. From the woods right of the 17th fairway, he went just over the back of the green and chipped in from 35 feet.
He didn't see until later how good his shot was into the 18th because he was in light rough short of the fairway bunker, unable to see the green but knowing it was good from the roar of the crowd.
""Oh my gosh,"" DeChambeau said when he watched the replay for the first time. ""I guess I should have pulled the flagstick.""
He is not the only player to putt with the flagstick in the cup — allowed under the new Rules of Golf — just the only one to apply science to the decision .
Koepka played in the last group of the day, and didn't have great energy in his group. Jordan Spieth had to rely on his short game to salvage a 75, matching his highest score at Augusta. Paul Casey, coming off a victory three weeks ago in Florida, failed to make a birdie in his round of 81.
Blinders on, Koepka played bogey-free in his first time at the Masters in two years. He missed last year recovering from a wrist injury that left him wondering if he would ever play again. Then he won a second straight U.S. Open, held off Woods to win the PGA Championship and has established himself as a major player.
""I think just an understanding of how to play and handle the bigger tournaments, and understanding how to deal with pressure a little bit better,"" Koepka said of his recent run of three majors in his last six tries.
He holed out from behind the green at No. 12 , picked up birdies on the par 5s and rolled in a bending 20-footer in between on the 14th.
Dustin Johnson and Ian Poulter were at 68, while Jon Rahm and Adam Scott were among those at 69.
Justin Rose, who returned to No. 1 in the world and was among the favorites this week because of his recent history at the Masters, opened with a 75.
""It's just a great test of golf to start out the first round of Masters,"" DeChambeau said. ""And to be honest, it's great to sift through some of the really good players and maybe not so great players in this event right now. And look, it's not to say they are bad players. It's just very difficult out there and every aspect of your game has to be on point.""

AUGUSTA, Ga. — Staid and tradition-driven Augusta National is suddenly on the cutting edge of technology.
The club that hosts the Masters isn't particularly known for its embrace of the new. The club agonizes over the slightest change to its course layout. Etiquette is paramount. History is revered.
A pimento cheese sandwich at concession stands is still just $1.50 for crying out loud.
But pop open a laptop when the tournament begins Thursday and for the first time the Masters plans to have nearly all of the 20,000-plus shots available to view on its website just a few minutes after they happen.
Club chairman Fred Ridley said the option is the first of its kind in golf.

LPGA co-founder and World Golf Hall of Fame member Marilynn Smith died Tuesday at the age of 89, the league announced.
Smith, who founded the LPGA with 12 others in 1950, would have turned 90 on April 13. Her death leaves Marlene Bauer Hagge and Shirley Spork as the only surviving co-founders.
""Marilynn was my Founder, my North Star and most importantly my friend,"" said LPGA Commissioner Mike Whan. ""In her life, she broke barriers, shattered stereotypes and made others 'believe.' I'll miss her weekly handwritten cards, her daily calls to my office and her love for every LPGA teacher, tour player, and staff member. Quite simply, Marilynn left this world better than she found it -- and set a standard that will guide us forever.""
Smith remained active in the game, most recently greeting finishers at the Founders Cup in Phoenix on March 24.
Smith posted 21 victories on the tour with two major championships. She was president of the LPGA from 1958-60 and was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2006.
Smith became the first woman to work a men's event as a TV broadcaster in 1973.

MELBOURNE — As Wiebe Wakker turned off his car in Sydney, Australia on Sunday afternoon it marked the end of a more than three-year journey for the Dutch adventurer and Blue Bandit, his converted electric Volkswagen Golf.
Wakker's Plug Me In initiative is the longest journey in an electric car ever recorded and was started to inspire and educate on a carbon-free future, according to the campaign's website.
Wakker departed the Netherlands on March 15, 2016 and has spent a total of 1,119 days travelling more than 95,000 km (59,000 miles) and visiting 33 countries to try and draw attention to the durability and sustainability of electric cars.
The drive had relied on the support of strangers across the globe who offered the traveller food, a place to stay and the essential means to charge his car along the way.
""I got about (1,800) people to sign up and make me zig zag all the way through Europe, the Middle East, India, Southeast Asia and finally today I arrived here,"" Wakker told supporters after reaching his finishing line.
Soon after 2 p.m. local time (0400 GMT), Wakker and a motorcade of electric cars crossed Sydney's iconic Harbour Bridge, before finishing his long journey at the Royal Botanical Gardens by the Sydney Opera House.

Brooks Koepka and Bryson DeChambeau each shot a 6-under 66 and are tied for the first-round lead at the Masters.
Koepka and DeChambeau followed a similar path Thursday, making the turn at 1-under before scorching the back nine of Augusta National. Koepka played a bogey-free round, making birdies on five out of six holes on Nos. 10, 12, 13, 14 and 15.
He had a chance to move to 7-under on 18, but his putt curved just right of the hole.
DeChambeau ended his round with six birdies on the final seven holes. His only misstep was a bogey on No. 14.
Phil Mickelson shot a 67 and is one shot behind the leaders. Ian Poulter and Dustin Johnson shot 68s to finish two shots back.
___
6:30 p.m.
Brooks Koepka has made three straight birdies on the back nine to jump into first place at Augusta National.
Koepka missed the 2018 Masters with a wrist injury, but won the U.S. Open and PGA Championship to emerge as one of the rising young stars on tour. The 28-year-old made the turn at 1-under, but made four birdies over the next five holes to move up the leaderboard in a hurry.
Koepka's run at least temporarily broke a logjam at the top of the leaderboard that included nine players tied for the lead at 3-under at one point.
Ian Poulter, Bryson DeChambeau and Dustin Johnson were tied for second at 4-under.
___
4:30 p.m.

The other players in Woods' group Thursday are among the early leaders: Haotong Li is at 2-under while Jon Rahm as at 1-under.
Rory McIlroy got into some trouble on his first tee shot after landing right of the fairway in the trees. He eventually made bogey.
McIlroy, who has never finished higher than fourth at the Masters, made it back to even par after making a 4-foot birdie putt on No. 3.
Corey Conners made an eagle on No. 15 to move into the lead at 3-under par.
___
10:55 a.m.

___
9:35 a.m.
Gary Player got the best of Jack Nicklaus off the tee. Nicklaus had the last word in the press room.
The 83rd Masters began with honorary tee shots, a tradition that dates to 1963 at Augusta National. Player, with a new endorsement deal at age 83, drilled his tee shot halfway up the hill on the left side of the fairway. Nicklaus, 79, was next and hit some 30 yards shorter.
They spent the next hour in the interview room. One of the topics was on amateur great and Augusta National co-founder Bobby Jones. Player, who won nine majors, said he felt a player needed to win at least six majors to be considered great.
Nicklaus spoke next on Jones. He said he agreed with everything Player had to say, except that someone needed 10 majors to be considered a great player.
The banter never ends.

WASHINGTON — It’s no secret that President Trump really, really dislikes wind power. He’s been vocal on the subject for years, ever since a
battle with Scottish officials
over a
plan
to build what he called a “really ugly wind farm” within sight of his golf resort in Aberdeen.
More recently, in rallies and speeches, Mr. Trump has stepped up his attacks on wind turbines,
suggesting
that their noise can cause cancer (there’s absolutely no evidence of this) and predicting power failures when the wind stops blowing (also not true).
Here’s a closer look at a few of his recent comments.
During a sometimes rambling digression about wind turbines at the National Republican Congressional Committee's annual spring dinner
in Washington on Tuesday
,
Mr. Trump said
: “They say the noise causes cancer.”
The suggestion that turbine noises cause cancer is completely unfounded. “The American Cancer Society is unaware of any credible evidence linking the noise from windmills to cancer,” a spokeswoman for the group said in an email.
Separately, some researchers have been investigating claims that noise from wind turbines might cause other health problems like nausea, headaches or sleeplessness. So far, experts
haven’t found strong evidence of links
to those conditions, although that debate is likely to persist.
When compared to the research around coal power, an energy source that Mr. Trump has long championed, the difference is stark.
There is ample evidence linking the particulate pollution from coal plants to
heart disease
,
respiratory problems
, and
lung cancer
. When Mr. Trump moved to relax restrictions on coal plant pollution last year, his own Environmental Protection Agency estimated that the change could lead to as many as
1,400 additional premature deaths each year
by 2030.
There’s been a major shift in how America makes electricity over the past two decades. Each state has its own story.
At the same dinner, Mr. Trump made this claim: “If you have a windmill anywhere near your house, congratulations, your house just went down 75 percent in value.”
There have been a few smaller studies suggesting that wind-farm development may have depressed property values in some areas. But the balance of evidence
suggests that this is uncommon
. Much larger studies, including an
analysis of more than 50,000 home sales
across nine states conducted by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in 2013, have found no evidence that home values are
generally
affected by nearby wind projects.
In any case, Mr. Trump’s golf course in Scotland
does not appear to have suffered
financially after the construction of the wind farm nearby.
At a rally in Ohio last month, Mr. Trump
suggested that wind power was too unreliable
to be useful. “Let’s put up some windmills,” he said. “When the wind doesn’t blow, just turn off the television darling, please. There’s no wind. Please turn off the television quickly!”
It’s true that wind turbines generate electricity only when the wind is blowing. But that doesn’t mean the power in your home will suddenly go out when the wind dies down.
Across the United States, regional grid operators typically rely on
a diverse array of power sources
throughout the day so that the lights stay on. During sunny hours, they can draw electricity from solar panels. When it’s windy, they can make use of power from wind farms. If power from those renewable sources starts to drop, operators can use power from natural gas turbines or hydroelectric dams to fill in the gaps.
So far, America’s grid operators have been very good at this balancing act, even as coal has declined and renewables have surged in popularity. Last year, wind power accounted for
nearly one-fifth of the electricity generated
in the Texas grid, and people were still able to watch TV there. When power failures around the country do occur, it’s almost always
because of severe weather knocking out
transmission
lines
, not because wind turbines stopped spinning.
However, it’s also fair to say that if wind and solar power continue to expand — the two sources produced
8.2 percent of the nation’s electricity last year
and are growing rapidly — grid operators could face new challenges in juggling those intermittent sources.
Possible solutions for that might include
adding batteries or other energy storage
to balance supply and demand, or improving weather forecasts so that operators can better predict the
output
of wind farms. Or building more transmission lines to get access to wind power from distant regions, on the principle that the wind is usually blowing somewhere
in the country.
Experts
have concluded
that it’s technically possible for the United States to
manage
a lot more wind and solar power than it uses today.
For instance, a
2016 modeling study published in Nature Climate Change
found that, using existing technology, the country could get 55 percent of its electricity from wind and solar if it built a network of high-voltage transmission lines. That study analyzed reams of historical weather data and concluded that the lights would stay on even with daily and seasonal fluctuations in the wind.
To be sure, there are
plenty of legitimate debates
about what the power grid of the future should look like and how big a role renewable energy ought to play in that mix. But the fact that the wind can come and go is hardly a slam-dunk argument against using wind power.

WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. — Fred Rosen, the retired Ticketmaster tycoon, was eating a melted ham-and-brie sandwich at the exclusive
San Vicente Bungalows
and spouting forth about belts.
Yes, what people use to hold up their pants. You can buy one at Walmart for $4, he noted. Or you can get one at Gucci for $1,500. “Every product I can think of has a luxury version, which got me thinking,” Mr. Rosen said. “Why not movies?”
It’s an idea that has captivated one entrepreneur after another over the years: For a high price, allow tech billionaires, Wall Street titans, professional athletes, Russian oligarchs and other ultra-wealthy people to rent movies — as soon as they come out in theaters — for viewing at home. Think of it like Netflix for one-percenters. But such upstarts have always sputtered, including one backed by Best Buy in 2013 that charged
$500 per movie
on top of $35,000 in setup costs. Film studios, fearful of angering theater chains, have been reluctant to participate. Piracy has also been a concern.
Mr. Rosen, 75, and a septuagenarian golfing buddy, Dan Fellman, who is Hollywood’s
foremost film distribution expert
, may have finally figured out how to make it work. They have quietly founded
Red Carpet Home Cinema
, which rents first-run films for $1,500 to $3,000 each. Red Carpet has contracts with Warner Bros., Paramount, Lionsgate, Annapurna and Disney’s 20th Century Fox and Fox Searchlight divisions — resulting in some 40 movies annually, including blockbusters like “Aquaman” and “A Star Is Born.”
Those partnerships reflect entertainment-industry relationships that Mr. Rosen and Mr. Fellman have cultivated over decades. Most studios do not see them as disrupters from Silicon Valley, something that has
stalled start-ups
like
Screening Room
, which has tried without success since 2016 to speed first-run movies to homes for a premium price. (Sean Parker of Napster and Facebook fame is behind that one.)
Red Carpet also arrives at a time when the movie industry is undergoing sweeping change — not the least of which involves the manner in which Netflix is
challenging the traditional way that films are released
. For the most part, theater owners insist on a three-month period of exclusivity to play new films. Netflix has started to chip away at that practice, offering theaters an exclusive window of three weeks or less for films like “Roma” and “Bird Box.”
Most studios see broader distribution change as inevitable, noted Harold L. Vogel, author of the textbook “Entertainment Industry Economics.”
“Consumers want to have more control,” Mr. Vogel said.
Even so, studios are treading carefully. None of the film companies that have signed on as Red Carpet partners would discuss the venture publicly. Several major movie operations, including Universal, Sony Pictures and Disney’s other labels, are Red Carpet holdouts. They also declined to comment.
“I feel pretty comfortable that we can gain more studio partners,” Mr. Rosen said. “We are a niche offering — I’m too old for disruption — but even if a studio makes $25 million to $50 million annually from us, that’s found money.”
Theater owners, in the meantime, seem to be taking a wait-and-see approach to Red Carpet.
“I have no take on that,” said Adam Aron, chief executive of AMC Entertainment, the dominant theater chain in the United States. In contrast, Mr. Aron has readily criticized start-ups like MoviePass, the
subscription ticketing service
.
The folksy Mr. Rosen, who took over Ticketmaster in 1982 and helped
turn it into a goliath
, and Mr. Fellman, who started his studio career in 1964, worked out details for Red Carpet over rounds of golf at the well-to-do Hillcrest Country Club in Los Angeles. The luxury service operates a bit like a private club. There is a rigorous application process, and participants must have a credit card with a limit of at least $50,000. Those who become customers must buy a $15,000 box that connects to a home theater system (installed by a technician) and comes loaded with piracy protections.
Prices for rentals are set by the participating studios, with higher fees for blockbuster-style movies like “Shazam!” and lower costs for dramas like “The Shape of Water.” Each rental allows for two viewings in a 36-hour period.
How big could Red Carpet get? There are more people who can afford it than you might think. Nearly 46,000 Americans have annual income of
more than $2 million
, according to Social Security Administration data from 2017. Mr. Rosen and Mr. Fellman, however, insisted over lunch in mid-March that they were not interested in size.
“We’re not even looking for 10,000 people,” Mr. Rosen said. With fewer than 4,000 customers, Red Carpet could have $300 million in annual revenue, according to Mr. Fellman’s projections.
Red Carpet, which counts Sherry Lansing, the former chief executive of Paramount, as an investor, has been operating in about 25 homes as part of a beta test since December. “I’m recommending the service to my friends,” the Red Carpet website quotes Ms. Lansing as saying.
Mr. Fellman added: “I’m not interested in starting a business that is disruptive to the theatrical experience. Maybe we get 400 homes in New York and L.A. Maybe 100 in each of the 30 biggest cities in the United States.” (Celebrities and Hollywood big shots have long been able to see first-run films in their homes — free — as part of something known as the Bel-Air Circuit. Studios allow a limited number of
preapproved V.I.P.s
to “borrow” copies of new movies.)
“We told studios, ‘You set the terms,’” Mr. Fellman said. “They appreciated that. What doesn’t work in Hollywood is going in and wagging a finger and saying, ‘This is how it’s going to be.’”

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump's tax returns will never be handed over to Democratic lawmakers, White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said on Sunday, defying an effort in Congress to learn more about the real estate mogul's personal finances.
Asked on ""Fox News Sunday"" if congressional Democrats will succeed in obtaining the Republican president's tax returns, Mulvaney said: ""No, never. Nor should they.""
He dismissed an effort to obtain the returns, launched on Wednesday by U.S. House of Representatives tax committee Chairman Richard Neal, as a political ploy from Democrats who will never stop attacking Trump.
“Democrats are demanding that the IRS turn over the documents. That is not going to happen, and they know it. This is a political stunt,” Mulvaney said.
Democrats countered that Neal's request to the Treasury Department for Trump's returns is grounded in law and a needed inquiry, given Trump's refusal to disclose his tax records and to divest himself of his business interests.
""This is a legitimate authority that the Congress has. This president, by the way, is the least transparent president that we've had in half a century,"" Democratic Representative Dan Kildee, a tax committee member, told ABC's ""This Week.""
Democratic Representative Ben Ray Lujan noted that presidents for decades have voluntarily released their income tax returns. ""This is not political, as our Republican colleagues are making it out to be,"" he told ""Fox News Sunday.""
An attorney for Trump on Friday blasted House Democrats' request for six years of Trump's personal and business returns as ""a misguided attempt"" to politicize the tax laws, accusing lawmakers of harassment and interference in IRS audits.
In a statement that mapped out the legal battlefield ahead, Trump lawyer William Consovoy said the request filed by Neal flouts ""constitutional constraints.""
Republican Senator Mitt Romney urged Trump to release his tax returns as promised but criticized Democratic efforts to force the issue through legislative action as ""moronic.""
""The courts are not going to say that you can compel a person running for office to release their tax returns,"" he said on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""
One of many investigations targeting Trump on Capitol Hill and in the U.S. court system, the House Democrats' probe into the president's tax returns could pull back the curtain on his business empire and his reputation as a dealmaker.
As a presidential candidate in 2016, Trump broke with a decades-old practice of making his tax returns public and continues to refuse to release them as president, while retaining ownership in many enterprises, ranging from golf courses and hotels and other properties.
If Congress takes the administration to court over Trump’s taxes then little case law would be available to help guide judges, legal experts said, both because the statute cited by Neal to obtain the returns has hardly ever been contested, and because most document disputes between the legislative and executive branches of government are resolved by negotiation.
The losing party could appeal, ultimately to the U.S. Supreme Court. If litigation extends into 2021, a judge could also force a newly elected Congress to start the process over, said Ross Garber, an attorney who specializes in political investigations.

SAN ANTONIO — Si Woo Kim narrowly missed a second hole-in-one on consecutive days and saw his four-shot lead trimmed to one over Monday qualifier Corey Conners after Saturday's third round of the Valero Texas Open.
Kim aced the 16th hole at the TPC San Antonio on Friday, and he missed it by inches on the way to a third round 3-under 69. He was at 15 under, and Connors, trying to become the first Monday qualifier to win on the PGA Tour since 2010, was a stroke back after shooting a 6-under 66.
Charley Hoffman, the 2016 Texas Open winner, moved up the leaderboard with a birdie-birdie-eagle finish and the week's best round of 64. He was two back of Kim at 13-under.
Scott Brown turned in a second straight 67, and Jhonattan Vegas also shot 67. Both were at 11 under with Kyoung-Hoon Lee (69) and four strokes back.
Rickie Fowler and Jordan Spieth started the day tied for second, four shots back. Both finished eight shots out of the lead after ballooning to rounds of 1-over 73.

(Reuters) - South Korean Kim In-kyung shot a sparkling seven-under 65 to take a three-stroke lead into the weekend at the ANA Inspiration at Mission Hills in Rancho Mirage on Friday.
The former women's British Open winner made a birdie at the last, her eighth of the day, to finish on eight-under 136 at the halfway stage of the first major of the year.
Australian Katherine Kirk, who tied for the lead at one stage but dropped shots at her last two holes, was in second place at five-under after a 68.
First-round leader Ally McDonald (72) was at four-under tied for third with Ko Jin-young (71), while world number one Park Sun-hyun (70) was the third South Korean on the leaderboard, in a tie for fifth a further shot back.
Kim, playing the back nine first, rolled in three birdies in a four-hole stretch twice, the second time to go eight under.
She dropped a stroke with her only bogey at the seventh hole but got it back with the final birdie to close her round.
""I put some good speed on it,"" Kim said of her putting. ""I think I got a little bit better job of that today.""
Seven years ago, Kim narrowly missed out on her first major when she failed to convert a one-foot putt on the final hole and lost a playoff to compatriot So Sun-young at Rancho Mirage.
""Long time it was one of my goals,"" Kim said of winning the title at Mission Hills. ""But now I am just happy to be out here. I have a better understanding of what I am doing out here.""
American Lexi Thompson, the 2014 champion, struggled as wind whipped up late in the day, hitting back-to-back bogeys on the seventh and eighth holes and carding an even 72 for a share of fifth with Park and three others five shots off the pace.
""It was a really hard day, not only with the wind, but some of the pin locations I don't think they really thought through with the extreme winds and crosswinds that they had coming in,"" Thompson told reporters.
""But I hit it very solid today, so still a lot of positives to take from the day going into the weekend.""
Canadian Brooke Henderson had been just a stroke off the lead when a triple-bogey at the par-three 14th ruined her round. She finished the day seven strokes behind Kim after a 72.
Swede Pernilla Lindberg's title defense ended in a flurry of bogeys as she shot a 78 to miss the cut along with American Michelle Wie (77).

(Reuters) - An attorney for President Donald Trump on Friday blasted U.S. House Democrats' request for six years of Trump's tax returns as ""a misguided attempt"" to politicize the tax laws, accusing lawmakers of harassment and interference in IRS audits.
In a statement that mapped out the legal battlefield ahead, William Consovoy said the request, formally filed on Wednesday by U.S. House of Representatives tax committee Chairman Richard Neal, flouts ""constitutional constraints.""
""The requests for his private tax information are not consistent with governing law, do not advance any proper legislative purpose, and threaten to interfere with the ordinary conduct of audits,"" Consovoy said.
""We are confident that this misguided attempt to politicize the administration of the tax laws will not succeed,"" he said.
One of the many investigations targeting Trump on Capitol Hill and in the U.S. court system, the House Democrat's probe into the president's tax returns could pull back the curtain on his business empire and his reputation as a savvy dealmaker.
Unlike previous presidents over recent decades, Trump has refused to make public past tax returns, while retaining ownership in many enterprises, ranging from golf courses and hotels to Trump Tower in New York City and his Mar-a-Lago private club in Florida.
Concerns about possible conflicts of interest have simmered since Trump moved into the White House in January 2017, along with lingering questions from his presidential campaign about his net worth, tax profile and past financial dealings.
Seeking answers to such questions, Neal this week invoked a law that gives the head of the tax committee the power to ask the Internal Revenue Service for a president's returns. He is seeking both Trump's personal and business tax returns.
Asked on Friday about Neal’s request, Trump said before leaving the White House for a trip to California, “From what I understand the law is 100 percent on my side.""
Congressional Republicans oppose Neal's effort, saying such a move sets a dangerous precedent by turning the confidential tax documents of a U.S. citizen into a political weapon.
A tax committee spokesman said it had no comment for now. An IRS spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and a spokeswoman for the Justice Department declined to comment.
""THEY DISLIKE HIS POLITICS""
When Neal filed his request to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig two days ago, Neal said it was ""critical to ensure the accountability of our government and elected officials.""
Trump has long maintained that he cannot release his returns because they are under IRS audit. The IRS, which is overseen by the U.S. Treasury Department, has said that Trump could release his returns even while under audit.
Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen recently testified in Congress that he did not believe the president was being audited, but may have used the audit claim to avoid scrutiny that could lead to an audit and IRS tax penalties.
In a letter to Treasury General Counsel Brent McIntosh on Friday, Consovoy called the request ""a transparent effort by one political party to harass an official from the other party because they dislike his politics and speech.""
He argued that any request from the House committee for private tax returns would need to have a legitimate legislative purpose, which he said Neal's request lacked.
Consovoy said the IRS should not comply with the request until it receives a formal legal opinion from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel.
Consovoy is also Trump’s personal lawyer in a case accusing him of violating anti-corruption provisions of the U.S. Constitution with his Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., which is pending at the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

WASHINGTON — When President Trump met with his embattled homeland security secretary on Sunday to
force her out
after months of stormy eruptions over immigration policy, the only other person in the room was Mick Mulvaney, who made no effort to head off the final confrontation and instead helped draft the letter of resignation.
When Mr. Trump decided to
get rid of his Secret Service director
, officials said, Mr. Mulvaney delivered the message rather than try to talk the president out of it. When Mr. Trump considered whether to
ask a court to invalidate the Affordable Care Act
despite
opposition from his own top legal advisers
, Mr. Mulvaney’s response: Follow your gut.
In his first 100 days as the president’s acting chief of staff, Mr. Mulvaney has assumed a central role in Mr. Trump’s circle but one markedly different than the previous two occupants of his corner office. For the first time since taking office, Mr. Trump has a chief of staff who has made it his job to encourage rather than restrain the president’s conservative instincts — to let Trump be Trump, in effect.
A former congressman from South Carolina and a leader of the Tea Party movement, Mr. Mulvaney is not a product of the Republican establishment like Reince Priebus, the first chief of staff, or the military hierarchy, like John F. Kelly, the second. Instead, he arrived at the White House from the revolutionary wing of the conservative movement, whose goal even before Mr. Trump entered politics was to blow up what it considered a corrupt and liberal Washington.
“I don’t think that he sees the role of the chief of staff to alter the personality of the person he works for,” said former Representative Trey Gowdy, a friend and fellow South Carolina Republican who golfed with the president and Mr. Mulvaney last month. “They have a good relationship, but the president’s the boss.”
Some outsiders see the cascade of hard-line policy ventures, unorthodox appointments and high-level purges of recent days as a sign of Mr. Mulvaney’s expanding influence, assuming that he is pushing Mr. Trump to the right. But insiders call that a misconception, insisting that Mr. Mulvaney at most is pushing on an open door and otherwise is merely liberating Mr. Trump to pursue the courses he prefers.
The lesson Mr. Mulvaney took from the unhappy experiences of Mr. Priebus and Mr. Kelly — both of whom were cast out unceremoniously via Twitter or comments to reporters — was that Mr. Trump is not interested in being managed by aides who think they know better, and so he has tried to build a process that he thinks better serves the president.
To some Republicans who had become resigned to an ungovernable White House, Mr. Mulvaney has been a welcome presence, one who has tamped down some of the tribal rivalries that played out in vicious form through clandestine disclosures to the news media.
“I think he’s become an asset because he’s learned how to keep the Trump train running,” said Scott Reed, the top political adviser to the United States Chamber of Commerce. “A combination of managing the staff, raising the morale and limiting the leaking has made him a successful Trump chief of staff.”
But to his critics, including some Republicans, Mr. Mulvaney’s approach has unleashed the president in dangerous ways. After forcing a
five-week government shutdown
at the start of the year, Mr. Trump in recent days threatened to
close the nation’s southern border,
selected
unconventional nominees
for the Federal Reserve despite significant vetting issues and began clearing out the top ranks of the Department of Homeland Security.
In a speech on the Senate floor on Tuesday, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, lamented the “chaos” in the White House stemming from the president’s “whimsical, erratic” behavior.
“I hope that the president or some of the people around him will realize that his administration is far from a fine-tuned machine,” he said. “It’s a slow-motion disaster machine that the American people see in action every day.”
Even some Republicans on Capitol Hill hold Mr. Mulvaney in low regard, particularly senators who view him as a former congressman with little deal-making experience and scant inclination to learn. In recent days, some criticized the expanding homeland security purge while others complained that Mr. Mulvaney does not meet with them enough.
During tense negotiations amid the government shutdown earlier this year, Senator Richard C. Shelby, the Alabama Republican and Appropriations Committee chairman, complained bitterly about Mr. Mulvaney’s penchant for undoing weeks of bipartisan work with a quick comment to Mr. Trump in the Oval Office. Mr. Shelby told Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the committee’s top Democrat, that Mr. Mulvaney was “the most dangerous man” in Washington, according to three people familiar with the exchange.
Mr. Shelby has not repeated that in public, but when a reporter on Capitol Hill asked him about Mr. Mulvaney last week, the senator tartly interrupted to offer a correction.
“You mean the
acting
chief of staff?” he said before walking away.
Mr. Trump has yet to formally remove the “acting” before the title, but after more than three months Mr. Mulvaney shrugs that off, telling others that everyone who works for the president serves at his pleasure and therefore is acting.
Indeed, Mr. Mulvaney is operating not as a temporary caretaker, but as someone who expects to stay for a while, bringing to the West Wing a clutch of aides from the Office of Management and Budget, where he served as director. He has engaged in team-building exercises like retreats at Camp David, most recently last week to discuss efforts to create a replacement for the Affordable Care Act.
He is generally liked by the staff, which recoiled at Mr. Kelly’s military style. Mr. Kelly made clear that he hated the job, muttering out loud when he left on many evenings that he might not return the next day. By contrast, Mr. Mulvaney tells people that he loves the job, an attitude that allies said has improved morale.
Even some Democrats praised Mr. Mulvaney for reaching out. Representative John Yarmuth of Kentucky, chairman of the House Budget Committee, said his relations with Mr. Mulvaney were “excellent” and noted that he was invited to Camp David for a trust-building visit.
“Mick’s never going to resolve Trump’s erratic behavior,” Mr. Yarmuth said. “He’s never going to be able to do anything about that. But over all, I think he’s been a much more effective chief than Kelly has.”
Still, Mr. Mulvaney has been criticized internally, by colleagues unwilling to be identified, for creating his own fief. And he has been faulted for appealing to Mr. Trump’s nativist instincts and desire to cater to his hard-core political base.
Mr. Trump does not share Mr. Mulvaney’s special passion for hawkish fiscal policies but signed off on a largely symbolic budget that incorporated some of those priorities, only to overrule his aides when proposed funding cuts to Special Olympics were publicized.
“The biggest problem I sense with Mulvaney is because of his own politics, he tends to push Trump further to the right than even Trump might want to go,” said Leon E. Panetta, who held the job under President Bill Clinton. “As chief of staff, your greater responsibility is to present to the president the options for what he should decide.”
Mr. Mulvaney has told people that he strives to do just that, ensuring that the president hears different points of view. During the deliberations over the Affordable Care Act, allies noted that Mr. Mulvaney made sure that Mr. Trump heard objections lodged by the Justice Department and White House counsel.
While Mr. Mulvaney has kept the essence of Mr. Kelly’s policy-development procedure, he consults with Mr. Trump earlier in the process to get his direction, rather than wait until the end. Although he was known as a firebrand in the House who stood up to Republican leaders, he is deferential to Mr. Trump, calling him “boss,” while making a point of spending off hours on the golf course with him.
In the West Wing, Mr. Mulvaney is seen as someone who knows when to fight battles, as opposed to Mr. Kelly, who often found himself at odds with Mr. Trump’s adult children and informal advisers. He does not try to manage access to the president as Mr. Kelly did. Rather than fight Mr. Trump’s natural desire to meet and talk with a variety of people, Mr. Mulvaney has taken a decentralized approach that he calls chief of staff by committee, empowering different advisers to provide the president their guidance.
It is a style most associated with Presidents Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter, each of whom resisted having a strong chief of staff at first, preferring what was called a “hub and spoke” model in which many people had access to the Oval Office. Both eventually abandoned the approach, concluding that it did not work, and Mr. Mulvaney eschews the hub-and-spoke term to avoid associations with those failed experiments.
People close to the president say Mr. Mulvaney gets too much credit — or blame — for Mr. Trump’s rightward turn on policy. Mr. Trump’s instinct is to appeal to core supporters who he fears will leave him, and he is the one who wants to demonstrate to them that he is continuing a hard line on immigration.
David Bossie, president of the conservative group Citizens United and a former deputy campaign manager for Mr. Trump, said the president was adjusting to a changing political environment.
“The president is responding to that new world order and that’s the mind-set,” Mr. Bossie said. “He is under siege by congressional Democrats, and that is how he’s operating — under siege.”
And Mr. Mulvaney is in the trench next to him.

The gravity of the event and the nuances of Augusta National are the driving factors behind only three rookies winning the green jacket in the 82 Masters contested since 1934.
Ten professionals among the 87-player field will be making their Masters debuts this week.
There are few household names, but plenty of talent that could make some noise this week. Rating the rookies in this year's field:
Eddie Pepperell, England (World Golf Rank: 40): Pepperell first popped onto the worldwide scene by posting the low round on Sunday at last year's Open Championship. He made another final-round run at The Players last month, again showing that he can handle the biggest stages. We like the 28-year-old's game -- and mental makeup -- to be hovering around the first page of the leaderboard come Sunday.
Matt Wallace, England (36): Some will recall Wallace's hole-in-one at last year's PGA Championship. But the Englishman is well known on the European Tour after posting three victories in 2018. His form hasn't been stellar since a solo second at the Dubai Desert Classic in January -- a T6 at Bay Hill being his only other top-10 this year. But Wallace's game garners a lot of respect from fellow players.
Lucas Bjerregaard, Denmark (43): Other pros had hinted at the Dane's all-around game before he slayed Tiger Woods en route to a semifinal showing at the WGC-Match Play event last month. He missed the cut last week and fatigue has to be a concern after a busy stretch in the U.S. for the European Tour star.
Keith Mitchell, United States (60): It's understandable that Mitchell's results have tailed off since winning his first PGA Tour event at The Honda Classic and then posting a T6 the next week at Bay Hill. He went T47 at The Players before failing to advance out of the group stage at Match Play. Mitchell has a lot of game and, more important at Augusta National, length to spare.
Corey Conners, Canada (84): Talk about a whirlwind turn of events. Conners had to Monday qualify just to be in last week's field at the Valero Texas Open. He then went on to win the event and secure the final spot in this year's Masters -- along with a slew of other perks. He's an unlikely contender but should at least be playing with nothing to lose.
Aaron Wise, United States (67): In the field courtesy of his victory at the AT&T Byron Nelson last year, there is little to suggest that Wise is prepared to make a run this week. He has four missed cuts in his past seven starts and only one top-20 result. His swing is highly inconsistent at the moment, which was on full display during his Match Play loss to Woods.
Andrew Landry, United States (128): Landry admitted losing some focus after winning his first PGA Tour event at last year's Valero Texas Open. He didn't make the cut in his title defense, which has been fairly standard of late. He has five MCs in nine events in 2019 and hasn't posted a top-20 result since last July.
Adam Long, United States (108): Another first-time winner this season at the Desert Classic, Long promptly missed his next five cuts. On the Web.com Tour this time last year, Long will no doubt enjoy the pageantry and the azaleas, but sticking around for the weekend would be considered a significant accomplishment.
Kevin Tway, United States (98): It has been going steadily downhill for Tway since beginning the 2018-19 season with a victory at the Safeway Open. That includes six consecutive missed cuts dating back to February.
Michael Kim, United States (330): How does the world's 330th-ranked player make his way into the Masters field? By winning last year's John Deere. Since then, Kim has missed 13 of 18 cuts, including all eight in 2019. He tied for last in the limited-field Tournament of Champions and missed two more cuts prior to that.

Figuring he can get more for his money, a homeowner sells his condo and searches the Hudson River waterfront for a gleaming rental. See if you can guess which he chose.
After 10 years of subletting and renting with roommates in Jersey City, Vick Sharma was ready for a change. “I was 30 and thought it was time to move up and branch out to a solo place,” said Mr. Sharma, now 38.
He calculated that his monthly outlay would be similar whether spent on a rental or a purchase, so he bought a one-bedroom condominium with more than 700 square feet in the developing Liberty Harbor area of Jersey City. And for almost seven years he lived there happily, walking to the PATH train to commute to his job in finance in Midtown Manhattan. But over time his housing costs increased, his taxes and monthly condo dues both going up.
“The property has appreciated and I can rent for less, so I think it’s time to exit,” Mr. Sharma said to himself. As an owner, his monthly outlay was $3,600, so that figure became his upper limit for a rental.
[Did you recently buy or rent a home? We want to hear from you. Email:
thehunt@nytimes.com
]
He intended to remain nearby. “Jersey City is turning into a mini-Brooklyn-type feel,” said Mr. Sharma, a Rutgers University graduate who grew up in central New Jersey. “So your entertainment level is pretty nice if you don’t want to go into the city.”
His condo had all of the amenities common in Jersey City’s new buildings, including a dishwasher and a washer-dryer, along with an outdoor swimming pool. “I wanted to mirror the setup,” he said.
After he sold the condo last summer, he had a month to find a new rental. He was looking for a one-bedroom big enough to fit his L-shaped sofa and round dining table, “so you can walk around without bumping into things,” he said.
He didn’t care about the view, “because my old place didn’t have a view.”
He considered three buildings, all of which had one-bedrooms well within his price range:
No. 1
The Alexander (Edgewater, N.J.)
The palatial building opened four years ago in Edgewater, about 10 miles up the Hudson River from Jersey City. “It kind of looks like the Venetian in Las Vegas,” Mr. Sharma said. “It’s pretty nice.”
It had a lavish lobby and a full array of amenities, including indoor and outdoor pools, and a small, on-site convenience store that was like “a fraction of Duane Reade,” he said. A strip mall was across the street.
Commuting options were a shuttle to the Edgewater Ferry Landing or a bus to Port Authority.
No. 2
9 Regent Street (Jersey City)
Part of the 89-acre Liberty Harbor development, this 10-year-old, eight-story building, also known as the Zenith, has an array of amenities including an outdoor pool, as well as a calendar of social events.
The available units when Mr. Sharma was hunting were loft-style spaces, with a sleeping area upstairs overlooking a living area below. It was a quick walk to the PATH train or the ferry terminal, as well as to Liberty State Park.
No. 3
333 Grand Street (Jersey City)
The newest addition to the Liberty Harbor site is a sister building to the Zenith, also with plenty of social events. The 40,000 square feet of amenities included a music room, theater, outdoor pool (still under construction) and a two-level gym with a rock-climbing wall and a golf simulator.
It is also a quick walk to the PATH train or the ferry terminal.

SUNRISE, Fla. — Dale Tallon and Joel Quenneville are together again, this time with the Florida Panthers.
Quenneville, who is second on the N.H.L.’s career victory list, was hired Monday to coach the Panthers. It’s also a reunion, after Tallon hired Quenneville to coach the Chicago Blackhawks in 2008 and wound up watching him win three Stanley Cups there in a six-year span.
Tallon, now the Florida general manager, wasn’t there for those Chicago titles; he was fired less than a year after delivering Quenneville. Finally, he gets a chance to work with Quenneville again.
“Fate is a wonderful thing in my life,” Tallon said. “It’s like a blessing for me. This is a blessing. There are a lot of coaching jobs available. We wanted to get it done because he’s a popular guy and a lot of teams out there would love to have him as their coach.”
Quenneville’s hiring was announced less than 36 hours after the Panthers’ season ended. Players were gathered Monday for exit interviews, an annual end-of-season rite. This time, they stuck around to meet the new boss, too.
“I believe this team is close to winning,” Quenneville said. “I was fortunate, luckiest guy in the world when I walked into the Chicago situation there — a team ready, sitting on go to win. I feel the same here now.”
It’s a bold move for the Panthers, who paid big to get Quenneville. He was owed $6 million for the 2019-20 season by the Blackhawks and it’s believed this deal keeps him in that salary range. It also represents a serious shift in the organization’s thinking, considering five of the last six coaches hired by Florida were first-time head coaches.
Not Quenneville. His 890 wins are second only to Scotty Bowman in N.H.L. history. He’s one of 11 coaches with three Stanley Cups.
“His record is impeccable,” Tallon said. “I think this is going to be a complete shot in the arm for the whole organization, on and off the ice. This is big time. This is a major step forward for our franchise.”
Quenneville replaces Bob Boughner, who was fired Sunday after two seasons. Buffalo Sabres Coach Phil Housley was also fired Sunday, the day after the regular season ended, and the Los Angeles Kings said Willie Desjardins, their interim coach for most of the season, would not return next season.
Tallon wasn’t looking to fire Boughner, and made clear that he still holds him in high regard.
But when Tallon read an article that suggested Quenneville was itching to coach again, the wheels started spinning. Tallon started by going to Panthers owner Vincent Viola to discuss the option and plot strategy. He then obtained permission from the Blackhawks to talk to Quenneville, who was fired by Chicago in November and was still under contract.
Then the sales pitch started. Late Sunday, an understanding was reached. Monday morning, the deal was announced.
“This doesn’t come around very often, opportunities like this,” Tallon said. “We had to think about what’s best for the franchise long-term. And this is a fabulous day for our franchise.”
Quenneville going to Florida makes sense on many levels. He likes golf. He’s into horse racing, as is Viola. He and Tallon have stayed close.
“Words can’t even express how excited our family is to come down to South Florida,” Quenneville said. “This is where we wanted to be.”
There’s also clear promise on the ice.
Aleksander Barkov, Jonathan Huberdeau, Evgeni Dadonov and Mike Hoffman had big scoring years, and Vincent Trocheck has emerged as a true leadership voice. Goaltender Roberto Luongo, who is considering a return, is another clear leader. Florida plans on being aggressive on July 1 to find free agents who will immediately shore up a porous defense. Playing for Quenneville will be a selling point for those free agents.
“I don’t want expectations to be, ‘Oh, let’s fight for a playoff spot,’” Tallon said. “I want to be the best. Vinnie’s given us that opportunity. He wants to win, I want to win, and now this sends the message worldwide: This team means business. And we’re going to go after it.”
When Tallon hired Quenneville in Chicago, the Blackhawks hadn’t won a playoff series in 11 years. Quenneville turned things around in a hurry.
Tallon is betting he can do it again.
“Me and Q,” Tallon said, “we’re on the back nine and we want to finish it off in style.”

One evening in 1996, as the Yankees clinched their first World Series in 18 years, Donald J. Trump was presiding over a masquerade ball at his sprawling Westchester County estate.
Mr. Trump intended to convert the home, a limestone mansion called Seven Springs, into a golf club, and he had recruited one of the county’s best-connected lawyers to help him do it: Albert J. Pirro Jr. The costume party was a lavish fund-raiser for Mr. Pirro’s wife, the Westchester district attorney, who greeted dozens of masked guests in her own striking get-up.
Jeanine F. Pirro had dressed as Queen Isabella of Spain.
“I was at the ballgame with George Steinbrenner, and it was great, just great,” Mr. Trump
told an attendee
at the time. “But this is just great, too.”
At the time, Ms. Pirro seemed destined for political stardom. Her fiery style had earned her a spot on the national TV circuit as a pundit on the O. J. Simpson case. The New Yorker was preparing
a fawning profile
, complete with Helmut Newton portrait. A run for lieutenant governor was in the offing; a United States Senate seat not out of the question.
But fates diverged for the luminaries in the room that night. Mr. Trump never got that golf course, though he eventually found success in bigger endeavors. Mr. Pirro would go to jail for tax evasion, tailed by rumors about Mafia ties and revelations that he fathered a child out of wedlock.
And Ms. Pirro fell to earth. Though she was never charged, her husband’s crimes damaged her political hopes; a Senate run in 2005 collapsed after she
stumbled over her announcement speech
. Later, she admitted to trying to wiretap Mr. Pirro’s yacht to catch him in an affair. (The couple are now divorced.) She scratched out a second act in daytime TV, hosting a low-rated courtroom show with C-list guests like Joey Buttafuoco. Another series, “You the Jury,” was
canceled after two episodes
.
And yet Ms. Pirro, 67, is in the midst of a late-in-life renaissance — as improbable and as polarizing as any of the twists in her unusual career.
Banished to a Siberia time slot — Saturday at 9 p.m. — Ms. Pirro has used
an unrelenting defense
of President Trump to put her weekly Fox News show, “Justice With Judge Jeanine,” at the heart of the national political conversation.
Stymied in her hopes for a Senate seat, she now has a direct line to the president. Her thunderous monologues calling for the imprisonment of federal prosecutors, or accusing the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, of treason, attract a devoted audience — not least in the West Wing, where Mr. Trump, a regular viewer, urges his millions of Twitter followers to tune in.
“She was in the right place at the right time with the right approach, and she’s taken advantage of it,” said Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president’s lawyer and a frequent guest, who shared a table with Ms. Pirro at Mr. Trump’s 2005 wedding to Melania Knauss.
Despite the Saturday time slot, Ms. Pirro averages an audience of more than two million viewers an episode. That’s more than the average number of people who watch the MSNBC host Chris Hayes on weeknights. “Saturday Night Live” parodied her on “Weekend Update” last month.
The president has taken notice. “I like being on air with your beautiful ratings,” Mr. Trump told Ms. Pirro when he called in for a chummy interview in October, one of three he has granted the host.
If “Meet the Press” is aimed at the Washington establishment, “Justice With Judge Jeanine” is red meat for the Make America Great Again set. “Judge Pirro has understood the MAGA movement since Day 1,” said Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager.
Her reputation among pro-Trump conservatives has only grown since March, when she
was suspended
by Fox News after questioning the patriotism of Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, asking on air if the Muslim lawmaker’s religious beliefs undermined her loyalty to the United States. The remark prompted protests at Fox headquarters and a rare intramural rebuke by the network, which renounced her comments.
Ms. Pirro has a history of remarks deemed Islamophobic,
declaring in 2015
that “we need to kill them, the radical Muslim terrorists hellbent on killing us.” But if the suspension was meant as punishment, it served only to supercharge her support from Mr. Trump, who tweeted a rallying cry: “
Bring back @JudgeJeanine Pirro
.”
Ms. Pirro never apologized. When she made her return on March 30, her show drew 2.56 million viewers, beating the competition on ABC and CBS.
For those who view Ms. Pirro as a camera-hungry opportunist — an accusation that has followed her from her days as a local prosecutor,
when she sought out appearances
with national TV hosts like Geraldo Rivera — her recent success is evidence of a willingness to bend principles for fame.
“I couldn’t imagine many of those comments coming from the person I knew,” said Mayo Bartlett, a lawyer who served under Ms. Pirro as an assistant district attorney. “After 9/11, there were a lot of anti-Muslim and anti-Arab hate crimes, and I had the green light from her to prosecute those cases. We stood with that community when they were really being targeted.”
A daughter of Lebanese-American parents, Ms. Pirro was raised Catholic in blue-collar Elmira, N.Y. Her mother was born in the United States, but spent much of her childhood in Beirut, where she later met Ms. Pirro’s father, a veteran of the United States Navy, after World War II.
“I learned to fight from my mother,” Ms. Pirro wrote in a 2003 memoir. “She impressed upon me throughout my childhood that I had to fight for myself, and I had to help those who were not strong enough to fight for themselves.”
Inspired by “Perry Mason,” Ms. Pirro dreamed of becoming a prosecutor, eventually starting one of the country’s first domestic-violence prosecution units. She was a centrist Republican in deep-blue New York, praised by Democrats like Geraldine Ferraro.
Now the Council on American-Islamic Relations is calling for Ms. Pirro to be fired. Ibrahim Hooper, the group’s communications director, pointed to the arrest last week of a man who threatened to kill Ms. Omar. Ms. Pirro, he said, “contributes to the toxic atmosphere in which that kind of violent behavior rises to the surface.”
Ms. Pirro declined to be interviewed for this article. In response to Mr. Hooper’s comment, Fox News referred to its prior statement
condemning
Ms. Pirro’s remarks about Ms. Omar, the Muslim lawmaker.
On the air, Ms. Pirro has echoed comments from her past, particularly when she attacks the investigation into possible ties between Mr. Trump and Russia, which she recently called “the biggest scandal in American history, bar none.”
In 2006, under investigation for bugging her husband’s boat, she called
the inquiry
a “witch hunt.” During Mr. Pirro’s trial in 2001, she denounced prosecutors for “a desperate attempt by them to bring me in this wherever they can.”
Although Ms. Pirro signed the couple’s joint tax return, she maintained she was unaware of her husband’s misdeeds. His trial dredged up embarrassing details about the Pirros’ spending, like a $1,800 wrought-iron pen for Ms. Pirro’s two Vietnamese potbellied pigs, Wilbur and Homer.
Fox News started “Justice With Judge Jeanine” in 2011. The show got a boost in 2015 from “The Jinx,” the popular HBO documentary about the real estate scion Robert Durst. As district attorney, Ms. Pirro reopened an investigation into the disappearance of Mr. Durst’s first wife. Though she never brought charges, Ms. Pirro later trailed Mr. Durst to his murder trial in Texas and spoke on TV so frequently about the case that she
earned a gag order
from the judge.
Ms. Pirro’s book “He Killed Them All: Robert Durst and My Quest for Justice” was
called a gift
to Mr. Durst’s defense lawyers by her critics, who faulted her attacks on investigators involved in the case. Relatives of Mr. Durst’s slain wife challenged some of the book’s claims. And the co-author, Lisa DePaulo,
sued Ms. Pirro
, saying the host forced her to perform menial tasks and tried to include material that she knew to be untrue. (The lawsuit was dismissed last month.)
On Instagram, Ms. Pirro presents a sunnier view of her life. She poses with her standard poodle, Sir Lancelot, and offers glimpses of her Westchester estate, which is outfitted Trump-style with imported marble. David Hebert, who served as a spokesman and assistant district attorney under Ms. Pirro, said in an interview that Ms. Pirro rose from setbacks “like a phoenix” and wished that critics knew her as “generous, kind, thoughtful.”
“We did a lot of work in the district attorney’s office reaching out to people who are disadvantaged and disenfranchised, to women and children and immigrants,” recalled Mr. Hebert, who is now the city manager of Oakland Park, Fla. “We made a special point of communicating on a regular basis with people who were not legal that they should not fear law enforcement.”
On Saturday, Ms. Pirro opened her Fox News program by lamenting the number of immigrants attempting to enter the United States. “One hundred thousand in one month, brought in just this past month,”
she declared
. “That’s what I just said — 100,000 in one month. That’s bigger than the town that I grew up in.”
In an interview, Mr. Giuliani was asked if he thought it unseemly for Ms. Pirro, a former prosecutor, to describe Justice Department leaders as potential traitors plotting a coup.
“Who better to criticize them,” Mr. Giuliani replied, “than someone who knows how it’s done?”

Trust the pork producers; fear the wind turbines.
By
Paul Krugman
Opinion Columnist
There’s a lot we don’t know about the legacy Donald Trump will leave behind. And it is, of course, hugely important what happens in the 2020 election. But one thing seems sure: Even if he’s a one-term president, Trump will have caused, directly or indirectly, the premature deaths of a large number of Americans.
Some of those deaths will come at the hands of right-wing, white nationalist extremists, who are a
rapidly growing threat
, partly because they feel empowered by a president who calls them “
very fine people
.”
Some will come from failures of governance, like the inadequate response to Hurricane Maria, which surely contributed to the
high death toll
in Puerto Rico. (Reminder: Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens.)
Some will come from the administration’s continuing efforts to sabotage Obamacare, which have failed to kill health reform but have stalled the decline in the number of uninsured, meaning that many people still aren’t getting the health care they need. Of course, if Trump gets his way and eliminates Obamacare altogether, things on this front will get much, much worse.
But the biggest death toll is likely to come from Trump’s agenda of deregulation — or maybe we should call it “deregulation,” because his administration is curiously selective about which industries it wants to leave alone.
Consider two recent events that help capture the deadly strangeness of what’s going on.
One is the administration’s
plan for hog plants
to take over much of the federal responsibility for food safety inspections. And why not? It’s not as if we’ve seen safety problems arise from self-regulation in, say, the
aircraft industry
, have we? Or as if we ever experience major outbreaks of food-borne
illness
? Or as if there was a reason the U.S. government stepped in to
regulate meatpacking
in the first place?
Now, you could see the Trump administration’s willingness to trust the meat industry to keep our meat safe as part of an overall attack on government regulation, a willingness to trust profit-making businesses to do the right thing and let the market rule. And there’s something to that, but it’s not the whole story, as illustrated by another event: Trump’s declaration the other day that wind turbines
cause cancer
.
Now, you could put this down to personal derangement: Trump has had an irrational hatred for wind power ever since he failed to prevent construction of a wind farm near his Scottish golf course. And Trump seems deranged and irrational on so many issues that one more bizarre claim hardly seems to matter.
But there’s more to this than just another Trumpism. After all, we normally think of Republicans in general, and Trump in particular, as people who minimize or deny the
“negative externalities”
imposed by some business activities — the uncompensated costs they impose on other people or businesses.
For example, the Trump administration wants to roll back rules that limit emissions of mercury from power plants. And in pursuit of that goal, it wants to prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from
taking account
of many of the benefits from reduced mercury emissions, such as an associated reduction in nitrogen oxide.
But when it comes to renewable energy, Trump and company are suddenly very worried about supposed negative side effects, which generally exist only in their imagination. Last year the administration
floated a proposal
that would have forced the operators of electricity grids to subsidize coal and nuclear energy. The supposed rationale was that new sources were threatening to destabilize those grids — but the grid operators themselves denied that this was the case.
So it’s deregulation for some, but dire warnings about imaginary threats for others. What’s going on?
Part of the answer is, follow the money. Political contributions from the meat-processing industry
overwhelmingly favor
Republicans. Coal mining supports the G.O.P.
almost exclusively
. Alternative energy, on the other hand, generally
favors Democrats
.
There are probably other things, too. If you’re a party that wishes we could go back to the 1950s (but without the 91 percent top tax rate), you’re going to have a hard time accepting the reality that hippie-dippy, unmanly things like wind and solar power are becoming
ever more cost-competitive
.
Whatever the drivers of Trump policy, the fact, as I said, is that it will kill people. Wind turbines don’t cause cancer, but coal-burning power plants do — along with
many other ailments
. The Trump administration’s
own estimates
indicate that its relaxation of coal pollution rules will kill more than 1,000 Americans every year. If the administration gets to implement its full agenda — not just deregulation of many industries, but discrimination against industries it doesn’t like, such as renewable energy — the toll will be much higher.
So if you eat meat — or, for that matter, drink water or breathe air — there’s a real sense in which Donald Trump is trying to kill you. And even if he’s turned out of office next year, for many Americans it will be too late.

The board of Condé Nast announced a new chief executive Thursday, naming Roger J. Lynch to take charge of the century-old publisher of Vogue, Vanity Fair and The New Yorker as the company looks to stem its financial losses and transform itself into a creator for the digital age.
Mr. Lynch is an outsider who comes from the worlds of technology, television and finance. Most recently he served as the head of Pandora, the streaming music service that SiriusXM
acquired
last year. Mr. Lynch and several other Pandora executives stepped down at the end of January.
“Condé Nast has really culturally significant and iconic brands,” Mr. Lynch, 56, said in an interview. “That’s why I got interested. I’m really looking forward to it.”
He will replace Robert A. Sauerberg Jr., who announced
in November
that he would step down once his successor had been found. Mr. Sauerberg, who ran the once-plush Condé Nast for less than four years, struggled to turn around the business, which was slow to adapt to digital platforms. The company’s sales declined, like those in the rest of the magazine industry.
[Read more about
Mr. Sauerberg’s tenure
at Condé Nast and his departure.]
Mr. Lynch, who is scheduled to start on April 22, will lead both Condé Nast and Condé Nast International. The sibling companies have historically been operated separately, but are being combined to save on costs and streamline much of the business.
Before taking the new job, Mr. Lynch will move from San Francisco to New York, where he lived in the 1990s when he was a banker at Morgan Stanley. He will replace Mr. Sauerberg on the four-person Condé Nast board; members also include Jonathan and Steven O. Newhouse, whose family has run the company since 1959, and Thomas Summer, the chief financial officer of Advance Publications, Condé Nast’s Newhouse-owned parent company.
Mr. Lynch has his work cut out for him. In 2017, Condé Nast
lost more than $120 million
, but it narrowed those losses last year after cutting costs through layoffs and increasing revenue from digital video. The company stopped putting out print editions of some of its magazines,
including Glamour
, and has been seeking buyers for Brides, Golf Digest and W.
Steven O. Newhouse, a nephew of the company’s longtime chairman,
S. I. Newhouse Jr.
, who died in 2017, helped lead the search for the new boss. He said the board had settled on Mr. Lynch after more than half a dozen meetings starting in December.
“We felt really comfortable dealing with Roger,” Mr. Newhouse said in a brief interview. “His experience dealing with disruption and uncertainty — which in the media business is now the norm — and his entrepreneurial skills gave him a unique skill set.”
Mr. Lynch, a veteran of TV and internet businesses, was well compensated at Pandora, receiving roughly $12.7 million in salary, stock awards and bonuses in 2017. After the Pandora sale was announced last year, he declined SiriusXM’s offer for him to stay on. It was around that time that Condé Nast reached out to him.
The unorthodox choice came partly at the suggestion of David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker, according to Mr. Newhouse. A few weeks after the board announced its search, Mr. Remnick sent Mr. Newhouse a list of six names that included Mr. Lynch.
Mr. Remnick has become something of a talent scout at Condé Nast. He also recruited
Radhika Jones
in 2017 when Vanity Fair was on the search for a new editor following the departure of its longtime leader Graydon Carter.
There was no aha moment in choosing Mr. Lynch, according to Jonathan Newhouse, a cousin of the company’s late patriarch who has directed its international operations since 1991 and was recently named the chairman of the board. “And that was good,” he said. “We didn’t want someone who was flashy. This was a rational process, and it took a lot of meetings.”
He added, “My role now is to support Roger as he takes on this responsibility, which he’s so superbly qualified to carry out.”
Mr. Lynch, a Virginia native who has bounced around the globe running businesses and start-ups, mostly in the tech industry, spent a large portion of his career at Dish, the satellite TV service. There, he ran the streaming service Sling, the first product to replicate a bundle of cable and network channels on a digital platform.
His experience in television and streaming could help Condé Nast amplify its digital video business, which has become a major source of revenue for the publisher.
“I definitely see that as part of the future,” Mr. Lynch said. “It’s very expensive to produce, but it’s also very lucrative.”
The larger challenge, as he sees it, is to find ways for the company to tap into the areas where audiences have flocked.
“It’s not fruitful to try to use logic to predict how consumers will behave,” he said. “It’s much more fruitful to see how they behave and adapt your business models to that.”
That is likely to mean trying new ventures and exploiting some of the company’s more successful digital efforts. Aside from online video, Vogue China has become a moneymaker for the company, thanks to its robust presence on the Chinese mobile app WeChat, which can be thought of as a combination of Facebook, Twitter, Amazon and Google.
Altogether, the company’s international business has become a bright spot, generating $50 million in profit for 2017, largely in Asia. The United States and European arms still incur losses.
In addition to his turnaround effort at Pandora, Mr. Lynch helped take Mark Cuban’s internet company Broadcast.com public more than 20 years ago, during his days as a Morgan Stanley banker. The deal eventually made a billionaire out of Mr. Cuban, who is now known as the owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball franchise and as a panelist on the reality show “Shark Tank.”
“He reminds me of that all the time,” Mr. Lynch said. “Internet valuations were hard to understand or rationalize at the time. I think the first day the stock tripled.”
Mr. Lynch also has a hobby: He plays lead guitar in a classic-rock cover band, the Merger. Other band members are also chief executives, he said, and the group has played charity events and once
opened for Lady Antebellum
.
His past work as a deal maker may raise eyebrows at 1 World Trade Center, the United States headquarters of Condé Nast, but he said a sale of the business was not on the agenda.
“I’m not going into this expecting that to happen,” Mr. Lynch said. “The family has owned it for decades, and I expect it to stay that way. That’s part of the appeal. I wouldn’t have taken this job otherwise.”

PHILADELPHIA — Since her book “Lead From the Outside” came out in paperback last month, Stacey Abrams has been showing up in places befitting a woman whose razor-thin loss in the 2018 Georgia governor’s race turned her into a national political star.
On “Morning Joe,” she parried questions about a possible presidential run. On “The Late Show,” Stephen Colbert surprised her by reading from one of the romance novels she has published under a pseudonym.
But last Friday, Ms. Abrams dropped in on a much quieter venue: the Library Company of Philadelphia, founded in 1731 by Ben Franklin, which bills itself as the oldest cultural institution in the United States.
It wasn’t a stop on Ms. Abrams’s book tour. Instead, she was there to participate in an intimate two-hour conversation about the history of voter suppression with four leading scholars. It will be published next year by the University of Georgia Press as part of a new series called
History in the Headlines
, which aims to bring historical expertise to bear on today’s most hotly debated issues.
The Trump era has been a red-alert moment for many historians, who have mobilized in the classroom, on op-ed pages and on social media to combat what they see as the erosion of democratic norms and an attack on truth itself.
For the conversation, the moderator,
Jim Downs
, a professor at Connecticut College, had recruited what he called a “dream team”: Carol Anderson, the author of
“One Person, No Vote
;” Heather Cox Richardson, an
expert
in the history of the Republican Party; Heather Ann Thompson, the author of a Pulitzer Prize-winning account of
the Attica prison revolt
; and Kevin M. Kruse, who has become famous for his
epic Twitter threads
smiting the dubious historical claims of pundits and politicians.
Before the event, they seemed galvanized at the prospect of talking with someone who has, as Dr. Kruse put it, skin in the game.
“When the email went out saying she was coming, I was like —,” Dr. Anderson, a professor at Emory University, said, clutching her heart. A few minutes later, Ms. Abrams approached.
“I just thank you for what you do,” Dr. Anderson said, introducing herself. “You just bring it, in whatever forum. You
bring
it.”
Asked why she wanted to take time out from her public schedule to participate, Ms. Abrams — a Democrat who
has called her loss
“fully attributable to voter suppression” — said she welcomed the context historians brought to what she has made a signature issue.
“I’m a little bit of living history for some of this,” said Ms. Abrams, who, had she prevailed, would have been the first black woman elected governor of any state. But mostly, she said, “I’m here to listen.”
The Library Company décor is old-school patrician (think early American furniture and dead-white-guy oil portraits), but in recent years it has emphasized its rich holdings in African-American history. Before the event, library staff members had laid out some items relating to the 15th Amendment, which gave black men the right to vote in 1870.
After the group arrived, the archival items were cleared off the table, and replaced by a bowl of Philly soft pretzels. Mr. Downs started out on a (relatively) light note, asking participants for their own early memories of voting.
Dr. Kruse, who teaches at Princeton, recalled voting for Gerald Ford in a preschool election, mostly because like his dad, Ford played golf. Dr. Richardson offered a rueful college memory of not bothering to vote in the 1980 presidential election.
Ms. Abrams, 45, flashed back to that same election, and what she said was the only “physical altercation” she ever had in school, with a classmate who called Jimmy Carter a Communist.
“I got into my first fight, Democrat versus Republican, in second grade,” she said. She paused. “I won.”
The nearly two-hour conversation, which was not open to the public, pinged back and forth between past and present. To the group, the Supreme Court’s 2013 decision in
Shelby County v. Holder
, which invalidated portions of the Voting Rights Act and freed nine states, mostly in the South, from federal oversight of elections, was reminiscent of the rollback of African-American political rights after Reconstruction.
What is different about voter suppression today, they agreed, is that it has been accomplished by bureaucratic maneuvering that makes it harder to see.
There was discussion of the battles over the so-called
Motor Voter Act of 1993
, which gave rise to increasing Republican claims of widespread voter fraud. After 1993, Republicans started asserting that Democrats “are only winning because there are illegitimate voters,” Dr. Richardson, who teaches at Boston College, said.
Dr. Kruse brought up the rise of “colorblind conservatism,” and pulled out his phone to check a quote from Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who, during oral arguments in Shelby, called extending the Voting Rights Act “a perpetuation of racial entitlement.”
“So the Voting Rights Act isn’t about equality, it’s about giving African-Americans an unfair advantage,” he said. “Which is a bizarre reading of history.”
Some of the questions felt like fact-gathering for future histories. Mr. Downs asked Ms. Abrams how she had reached the decision to make her fiery speech, 10 days after the Georgia election, announcing that she was
ending her campaign but, pointedly, not conceding
.
She said voter suppression was too often abetted by the “complicity” of political candidates, including the losers.
“Part of the reason voter suppression works is we’ve created this culture that says you don’t challenge the outcome of elections, unless the act is so egregious as to be absolutely clear on its face,” she said. (Fair Fight Action, a group allied with Ms. Abrams, has
filed a federal lawsuit
challenging Georgia’s election procedures and accusing her opponent, Brian Kemp, who, as Georgia secretary of state, oversaw the election, of systematically disenfranchising poor and minority voters.)
The scholars offered correctives to some popular narratives, starting with the argument, invoked often by Ms. Abrams’s critics, that Richard Nixon had graciously conceded the 1960 presidential election, for the good of the country, rather than challenge rumored fraudulent votes for John F. Kennedy.
At least that’s the way Mr. Nixon told the story in his book “Six Crises,” Dr. Kruse said. But in fact, he noted, the Republican Party had
begun challenges in 11 states
, before dropping them.
Near the end of the conversation, when Mr. Downs invited questions from the small group of observers, one person addressed what she called the “unspoken” political consensus in the room, raising the counterargument that focus on voter suppression was just a strategy for getting more Democrats elected.
Dr. Thompson, who teaches at the University of Michigan, warned against “fetishization” of the Democratic Party. “At every step along this historical path, Democrats” — and not just Dixiecrats — “have many times been intensely interested in disenfranchising poor urban black voters too,” she said.
Ms. Abrams noted that she had appeared in
a Fair Fight Action commercial
aired in Georgia during the Super Bowl alongside a Republican county commissioner. Voter suppression, she said, “can eviscerate democracy for everyone.”
If there was palpable admiration in the room for Ms. Abrams, she beamed it right back. Politicians, she told the group, “need your help.”
“We tell the same myths over and over again until they sound like truth,” she said. “Where I think historians can help preserve and actually restore democracy is to remind us of how we got it.”

WASHINGTON — The arrest of a Chinese woman who carried a malware-laced device into Mar-a-Lago, President Trump’s Florida resort, has exposed porous security at the private club and escalating tensions between Secret Service agents and the resort’s staff members, who vet guest lists and allow people onto the sprawling grounds.
At times neither side has had full clarity on who was entering Mar-a-Lago. Secret Service agents must rely on club receptionists and other employees to crosscheck visitors, former officials said.
Communication breakdowns allow for security breaches — like the one on Saturday, when the woman, Yujing Zhang, 32,
was arrested
with four cellphones, a hard drive, a laptop and a malware-infected thumb drive. She said she was there to attend a “United Nations Friendship Event” that had never been scheduled.
Her arrest revealed gaps in Mr. Trump’s security as well as the challenge of protecting a president who spends less time at the remote, fortified Camp David and more time at his busy resort with sometimes hundreds of guests. The normally tight-lipped Secret Service was so disturbed by the breach that it issued an unusual statement that effectively blamed the Mar-a-Lago staff for not tightly tracking the comings and goings of guests.
“The Secret Service does not determine who is invited or welcome at Mar-a-Lago; this is the responsibility of the host entity,” the agency said in a statement late Tuesday. “The Mar-a-Lago club management determines which members and guests are granted access to the property.”
The arrest of Ms. Zhang came against a backdrop of increasing interest in Mar-a-Lago in China, where advertisements on the internet and on social media sell invitations to the club, which also functions as a for-profit enterprise that rents itself out. The advertisements promise the prospect of rubbing elbows with the president and his associates at banquets, fund-raisers and other events. Access to Mar-a-Lago is highly prized in China, bestowing respect, influence and the allure of potential business opportunities.
After Ms. Zhang was stopped, she produced a copy of a Chinese-language invitation for the friendship event that was promoted by Cindy Yang, who had
previously owned
a string of massage parlors
where the police shut down a prostitution ring
in February. The authorities said the patrons included Robert K. Kraft, a friend of the president’s and the owner of the New England Patriots.
Ms. Yang, who is active in groups backed by the Chinese government and Communist Party, is no stranger to Mar-a-Lago herself. Last year,
she attended a Trump fund-raiser
at the resort and posed for a photo with the president.
Federal officials said they were still investigating Ms. Zhang and what kind of malware was on her thumb drive. It was not yet clear whether she was just a striver seeking selfies at the president’s resort or whether she had links to Chinese intelligence. Ms. Zhang’s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.
Hotels owned by the Trump Organization have come under cyberattack before; in 2015, credit card information was stolen from a number of Trump hotel properties. But that appeared to be criminal action, rather than the act of a state.
Some of the Chinese promoters of these events flaunt their connections to China’s ruling Communist Party and the department that promotes its foreign policy abroad, the United Front Work Department.
When the president is in Palm Beach, as he was on Saturday, agents must construct a government security system on top of what is essentially a private residence. Questions about the process arose about a month after Mr. Trump assumed office in 2017,
when resort guests took plain-sight photos
of Mr. Trump and the Japanese prime minister discussing a North Korean missile launch. Several Democratic lawmakers called for an investigation into how the club was vetting its visitors.
“The Secret Service relies on the club’s security, who has the guest list to tell them who belongs and who doesn’t,” said Don Mihalek, executive vice president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, which represents the Secret Service.
“The Secret Service is not in the club membership business and does not have visibility on who these members are or what they’re entitled to,” said Mr. Mihalek, a former Secret Service agent who was assigned to Trump Tower during the 2016 campaign and presidential details from 2007 to 2011. “That’s the standard for any protected site outside of the White House.”
On Wednesday, Mr. Trump praised the Secret Service and his staff at Mar-a-Lago for helping to catch the woman. “The person at the front desk did a very good job, to be honest with you,” he said.
A former employee who worked at Mar-a-Lago from 2016 to 2018 said that the arrest of Ms. Zhang was not surprising; people have been caught on the property previously. In one notable example, a woman gained access to the Mar-a-Lago computer system and changed the automatic screen saver to the name of the president, preceded by an expletive, according to the employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of legal retribution.
The former employee said security at the estate was not particularly strong, particularly when Mr. Trump was not there — a fact that was well known among the staff.
Joe Kirschbaum, who helped write a Government Accountability Office report on Mar-a-Lago security, said congressional inspectors received little help from the White House or the Trump Organization. He warned that it was not the responsibility of the Mar-a-Lago staff to keep Mr. Trump safe, and that the limited amount of information allowed to the Secret Service could create future problems.
In a letter on Wednesday,
several Democratic senators
asked Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, to assess the security conditions at Mar-a-Lago.
“The latest incident raises very serious questions regarding security vulnerabilities at Mar-a-Lago, which foreign intelligence services have reportedly targeted,” wrote Senators Chuck Schumer of New York, Dianne Feinstein of California and Mark Warner of Virginia.
The president has personally instructed members to pack fund-raisers beyond the ticket limit at Mar-a-Lago, according to one event organizer who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share private conversations with Mr. Trump.
The fund-raisers, which occur most weekends during the height of the winter season — usually held in hopes that the president or his family members may drop in — are staged in a large ballroom adjacent to the main patio where Mr. Trump eats his dinner.
Mr. Trump encouraged one organizer to pack the ballroom for a February event beyond the 700-person limit, advising that person to tell his staff at Mar-a-Lago that he said he would allow the increase. That organizer was told that the Mar-a-Lago security team had no final say over crowd numbers, but the event still grew to around 730 guests.
In the end, Mr. Trump did not attend, and it was screened by Mar-a-Lago officials and a private security company hired by the event’s organizers.
When the president is not at his club, the security bubble becomes easier to break.
Members and guests must still present identification and check in with the club’s security team, but several layers of Secret Service protection are not in place. Laurence Leamer, a Palm Beach resident who
wrote a book about Mar-a-Lago
, said in an interview that the scene could be freewheeling, “like having dinner at the Outback Steakhouse,” adding that the security “seems to me to be incredibly lax.”
Mr. Trump was at his nearby golf club four miles away when Ms. Zhang showed up at the resort on Saturday, and the process that the Secret Service uses to check visitors when he is in town was in place, officials said. Ms. Zhang was screened by agents before reaching the club’s reception area, but confusion over her name and a potential communication barrier led to her entering.
On Wednesday, the Secret Service was reviewing the Saturday incident with security at Mar-a-Lago. John Cohen, a former acting under secretary at the Department of Homeland Security who worked closely with the Secret Service on protection details, said the president’s “predictable” travel to the resort had made the location vulnerable.
“That’s a nightmare for the Secret Service,” he said. “A privately owned ranch where the president and his people use the location is much easier than protecting the president when he chooses to go to a private club that’s open to members that provides services to those people in exchange for a fee.”
When people approach a checkpoint at Mar-a-Lago, the Secret Service is focused on screening them for weapons or explosives, Mr. Mihalek said.
The agents will also screen for people they label “gate callers,” those who have exhibited suspicious behavior — such as waiting for the president at the gate of the White House. From there, an agent will rely on security guards or staff members at the location to verify whether someone is a member or a guest of the club.
“If I’m an intelligence service I’m going to pay the membership fee, get someone with a clean background and have them become a member of the community,” Mr. Cohen said. “I’m going to have them bring in guests on a regular basis, and that’s going to be my strategy. I now have close proximity to the president’s staff and maybe even the president himself.”
An earlier version of this article misstated the ownership of hotels that have been subject to cyberattacks. They are owned by the Trump Organization, not the Trump administration. An earlier version of a picture caption misidentified a property visited by President Trump in Florida. The president’s motorcade was entering the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, not the resort Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach. It also described incorrectly the Mar-a-Lago property. It is a private resort, not a golf club.

about how to use our Summer Reading Contest to get teenagers reading, writing and thinking over the summer.
_________
Every year since
2010
we have invited teenagers around the world to add The New York Times to their summer reading lists and, so far, nearly 50,000 have.
At a time when teachers are looking for ways to offer students more “voice and choice,” we hope our open-ended contest can help: Every week, we ask participants to choose something in The Times that has sparked their interest, then tell us why. At the end of the week, judges from the Times newsroom pick favorite responses, and we publish them
here
. It’s as simple as that.
Though our goals include some on many educators’ lists — helping students become more aware of the world and their place in it, learning how to navigate sophisticated nonfiction, and practicing writing for a real audience — we also just hope that students will realize that reading the newspaper can be fun.
As you’ll see in the guidelines below, they can choose literally anything they like that was published on NYTimes.com in 2019. We don’t care if they pick a piece about
politics
or
pythons
,
golf
or “
Game of Thrones
,”
Qatar
or the
Kardashians
,
robots
,
racing
,
recipes
or
the royal baby
; we just care about why they chose it.
Interested? All the details you need are below, and
this handy PDF
summarizes them on one page.
__________
__________
Q. How does this contest work?
•
Every Friday beginning June 14,
we will publish a post
here
asking the same two questions: “What interested you most in The Times this week?” and “Why?.” You can always find that link at the top of this page since we’ll post it there every week.
•
Teenagers can post an answer any week until Friday, Aug. 23
, and contestants can choose from any Times article, essay, video, interactive, podcast or photograph published in 2019, on any topic they like.
• Every Tuesday starting July 2 we will announce winners from a previous week and
publish their writing
.
• To get an idea of the breadth of topics students have chosen in the past — from
refugees
and
“post-truth politics”
to
accents
and
awkwardness
— you can read the work of our 2017 and 2018 winners
here
, and our 2010-2016 winners
here
.
• Scroll down to find more details and tips, the most important of which are also on
this one-page PDF
.
• More questions? Here are some that have been frequently asked over the years, but please post anything else you’d like to know in the comments, or write to us at LNFeedback@nytimes.com, and we’ll answer you there.
__________
__________
Q. What kinds of responses are you looking for?
A.
We don’t care what you choose or whether you loved or hated it; what we care about is what you have to say about why you picked it.
If you don’t believe us, scroll through our
2017 and 2018 winners
, or, via our old blog, view the work of
winners
from 2010 to 2016.
They have written on weighty topics like
gender, race and identity
,
space exploration
and
21st-century concentration camps
, but they have also written on
power napping,
junk food
,
Beyoncé
,
Disney shows,
running
and
bagels.
Whatever the subject, you’ll see that the best pieces year after year make both personal connections to the news and go beyond the personal to discuss the broader questions and ideas that the topic raises.
So whether you were moved by an
article
, enlightened by an
essay
, bowled over by a
photo
, irked by an
editorial
or inspired by a
video
, find something in The Times that genuinely interests you and tell us why, as honestly and originally as you can.
__________
__________
Q. What are the rules?
A.
First,
here is a one-page PDF summarizing the rules
. Please share.
•
We will post the same questions every Friday, starting June 14. Each week we will ask, “What interested you most in The Times this week? Why?” That is where you should post your picks (and reasons) any time until the next Friday. Then we will close that post to comments and open a new one with the same questions. That means that students can write in on any day until Friday, Aug. 23, at 7 a.m. Eastern when the contest ends.
As soon as the contest starts, we will keep an up-to-date link to that week’s question at the top of this page.
•
You can choose from anything published in the print paper or on
NYTimes.com
in 2019, including
videos
,
graphics, slide shows and podcasts.
•
Feel free to participate any or every week, but we allow only
one
submission per person per week.
•
Our commenting system allows responses up to 1,500 characters, which is somewhere between 250 and 300 words.
•
Make sure to provide us with the full URL or headline (for example, “How to Deal With a Jerk Without Being a Jerk” or
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/smarter-living/how-to-deal-with-a-jerk-without-being-a-jerk.html
).
•
The children and stepchildren of New York Times employees, or teenagers who live in the same household as a Times employee, are not eligible to participate.
• New for 2019:
Our eligible age ranges have changed slightly in response to
new data-protection rules in the European Union
.
Students in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom must be between 13 to 19 years old to participate. However, if you are submitting from anywhere else in the world, you must be between 16 to 19 years old. Please see The New York Times’s
terms of service
for more details.
Q. Who will be judging my work?
A.
The Learning Network staff, plus a team of as-yet-to-be-named New York Times journalists.
Q. When should I check to see whether my submission won?
A.
Every Tuesday from July 2 to Sept. 3, we will publish a previous week’s winner or winners in a separate article you can find
here
. We will also celebrate the winners on
Twitter
and
Facebook.
__________
__________
Q. How do I participate in this contest if I don’t have a digital subscription?
A.
NYTimes.com has a digital subscription system in which readers have free access to five articles each month. If you exceed that limit, you will be asked to become a
digital subscriber
.
One thing you should know, however, is that all Learning Network posts for students, as well as all Times articles linked from them,
are accessible without a digital subscription
. That means that if you use any of the articles we have linked to on our site for summer reading, they will not count as part of the five-article limit.
Plus, each week when we pose our question, “What interested you most in The Times this week?,” we will link to about 25 recent articles across sections that you can choose from if you don’t have your own subscription.
You can also find The New York Times at most public libraries, and some even allow you to access NYTimes.com with your library card.
And remember: You can use anything published anytime in 2019.
Q. How do I prove to my teacher that I participated?
A.
When you comment, make sure to check the box that asks if you would like to be emailed when your comment is published.
If you do so, the system will send you a link to your comment, which you can use to show your teacher, your parents, your friends or anyone else you’d like to impress.
Please note that you will not get an email until the comment has been approved, which may take up to 48 hours over weekends.
Another method? Some teachers ask students to take screenshots of their comments before they hit “submit,” then gather those all together at the end of the summer.
__________
__________
Q. How can teachers, librarians and parents use this challenge?
A.
Through the years, adults have told us over and over that participating in this contest has made their students both more aware of and more interested in what’s going on in the world. Many see it as a low-stakes way to help teenagers start building a news-reading habit.
If that’s not enough of a reason to assign it, our contest is also an easy way to add more nonfiction to your students’ reading lists — and to encourage teenagers to
make their
own
choices
about what to read, as anything published in The Times in 2019 is fair game.
Participating also meets the recommendations given in
this joint statement on independent reading
given by the International Reading Association, the National Council of Teachers of English, and the Canadian Children’s Book Centre.
But maybe the most compelling reason to assign this contest is what students themselves say about it. Reflecting on participating in 2017, a teenager named Emma Weber, from London,
told us
:
Prior to this summer, the only writing I did was for school assignments or Google searches. And if I did get around to it, I never reread what I wrote. That’s why, as the weeks went on, I surprised myself when I began double and triple checking my comments for mistakes, of which there were far more than expected!
Another transformation is my newfound interest in the news. I used to be the kind of person who opened a newspaper and went straight to the puzzles section, and though that may be unchanged, I now feel compelled to read a few articles that catch my eye too. In return, exposing myself to current affairs has fine-tuned my political opinions, and through consistent writing I learned to express them in a way that accentuates them.
The result? I feel grounded in my views and understand what’s going on in the world. It’s amazing what a change 1,500 characters a week make.
Thank you for making this contest a hit year after year, and please spread the word that it’s back for its tenth season.
Good luck!

APRIL 10, 2019
Paul Rudnick’s original play “Presidential,” written for T’s Culture issue.
By Paul Rudnick
APRIL 10, 2019
A Georgetown family room, 2023.
IVANKA
We need to talk, please put that thing down.
JARED
But it’s so cool, see, the hologram of Aquaman appears before the United Nations Security Council and thanks me for ending all wars everywhere.
IVANKA
It’s a video game.
JARED
Then Thor says that I saved his home planet of Asgard …
IVANKA
We need to decide which one of us should be the next president. I’ve done a PowerPoint thing, listing our individual strengths. I’m smart, beautiful, gracious and everyone in China thinks I’m an enchanted princess. On your side, while you’re underweight and unfocused, you always remember to look at me like I might be a mermaid. And we both have wonderfully high-pitched, featherlight speaking voices.
JARED
I always try to imagine that I’m whispering a poem to my favorite stuffed animal on a rainy day.
IVANKA
I would ask my dad what we should do, but the warden confiscated his phone again because he won’t stop tweeting about how he’s in the biggest prison ever, reserved for only the most important criminals. Only he keeps misspelling Sing Sing. The first time he called it Sing Song, then Ring Ring, and now it’s Sing-a-Lago.
JARED
Before we decide anything, we should ask our kids if they’re O.K. with the whole deal.
IVANKA
They’re so adorable. This morning they marched into my dressing room while my assistants were buttoning me up and pretending to be bluebirds. Then the kids presented me with a notarized document saying that while it’s no reflection on us, they want to make their own way in the world and be judged on their own merits, so they’re all changing their last name.
JARED
That’s so cute! To what?
IVANKA
“Clinton.”
JARED
But if I become president, I can finally reveal my plan for feeding the hungry, ending climate change and bringing peace to all nations.
IVANKA
So how would you do it?
JARED
Why do you have to be like that?
IVANKA
I’m sorry, I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to badger you …
JARED
How many times do I have to tell you, it’s a SECRET plan!
IVANKA
But come on, can’t you give me one tiny little hint?
JARED
O.K., one word: golf carts.
IVANKA
Whoa.
JARED
I know! But if you’re president, what will you do?
IVANKA
I’ll keep empowering women everywhere, sometimes by pulling my hair back in a sleek, high ponytail and other times by doing my signature facial expression. Watch, I’m going to do it now. I’m widening my eyes just a bit, I’m tilting my head down and putting my forefinger on my chin, but just gently, so I don’t look smushed in photos. I call this expression Listening and Learning, and it’s copyrighted. O.K., tell me something really important, and I’ll do the face.
JARED
Um … Chris Christie has a nuclear weapon in a Styrofoam cooler in the trunk of his Datsun.
IVANKA
See, I’m doing the face, so while I look concerned and empathetic, I have no idea what you just said.
JARED
That’s awesome!
IVANKA
Who would you pick as your running mate?
JARED
You. Duh. So I wouldn’t have to remember a new name.
IVANKA
But that makes me feel bad, because I wasn’t going to pick you. I would choose Jeanine Pirro because when I stand next to her I seem sane by comparison. Or I might pick Ariana Grande, because young people like her.
JARED
Not anymore. Not since she became the governor of Minnesota.
IVANKA
Fine, then maybe I’ll just keep Mike Pence.
JARED
That’s so mean!
IVANKA
I know, he was so heartbroken after my dad, you know, took a break, and even the Republicans said, “Instead of Pence, let’s make Lindsey Graham the new president.”
JARED
Poor Lindsey.
IVANKA
It’s tragic. There he was, president of the United States, but since for the first time in his life he didn’t have anyone to bad-mouth and then suck up to, he had that complete nervous collapse. The Secret Service found him talking to a velvet-upholstered settee in the Lincoln Bedroom and telling it, “I support you 100 percent, Your Highness.”
JARED
And then Mike Pence got his hopes up all over again.
IVANKA
Until Congress voted to make that settee president instead.
JARED
Which would inspire my campaign slogan: “Vote for Jared — another great piece of furniture.”
IVANKA
I love that. My campaign logo would be a photo of me handing a purse from my discontinued fashion collection back to the teenager in Romania who made it.
JARED
I’m just going to float this idea: What if we both ran for president?
IVANKA
Against each other? But sweetheart, I’d slaughter you in the debates. Even when we watch “Jeopardy!” you always start sobbing and saying, “But doesn’t it count as a question if my voice goes up at the end of the sentence?”
JARED
No, I meant, what if we ran as a couple? As co-presidents? With Eric and Donald Jr. as our co-vice-presidents?
IVANKA
But Eric and Donald Jr. are still in hiding, ever since they saw that last “Jumanji” sequel in Imax 3-D and decided that the animals were coming after them.
JARED
What if Melania is our vice president?
IVANKA
But after the divorce, when she married Jeff Bezos, she said that she wanted to stay out of the spotlight. She said that she only wanted to exist as an app where people could admire photos of her and make only positive, life-enhancing comments like, “For the first time I finally understand leather leggings with stretch.”
JARED
What about Tiffany?
IVANKA
My half sister?
JARED
I’ve noticed that you always introduce her that way, by saying, “This is my half sister, Tiffany.” At first I thought that meant her body stopped at the waist.
IVANKA
I love my half sister Tiffany. She finished law school and she’s smart and pretty. She’s like if Mike Pence became sentient.
JARED
Wait, what does that last word mean? I know, I know, Google it, or ask Giuliani.
IVANKA
I love that we named our new hamster Giuliani. Because it was so sad when the real Rudy went on trial in The Hague, after his appearances on Fox News were declared crimes against humanity.
JARED
So when we’re co-presidents, because of #MeToo, I’ll just wear my navy blazer and sit quietly and play video games.
IVANKA
While I do my Listening and Learning face! I'm working on adding a new feature, where I purse my lips slightly to show reaching out. I’m calling it Listening and Learning and Demonstrating All-Purpose Compassion.
JARED
But who do you think the Democrats will run against us?
IVANKA
Bernie Sanders looks great with his new hairpiece, which he’s justifying by claiming that under his administration, hairpieces will be available to everyone regardless of gender identity, race or household income. And Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wants to run, but I can demolish her by going on any Fox News show and asking, “Does America really want a brunette?” I think the only candidate we really have to worry about is Chelsea Clinton.
JARED
I would vote for her. I know, I’m sorry, you told me to stop saying that.
IVANKA
Chelsea and I used to be friends, and I hate that we’re not anymore. So maybe we could all run a transparent and fair-minded campaign, without partisan rancor or mudslinging. Jared, stop it. We’ve talked about your giggling.
JARED
Because it’s not presidential. Like tuneless humming or fidgeting or chasing cars.
IVANKA
Thank you. Our only real obstacle to leadership is the notion that we’re completely unqualified and were only given White House jobs because of the worst kind of nepotism.
JARED
But how do we fight that?
IVANKA
By both of us using this auxiliary blank facial expression and replying, “Those accusations are hurtful,” and then doing a photo op where we hold hands and stride purposefully across a lawn.
JARED
But where are we striding to?
IVANKA
A bright future. Or brunch.
JARED
Can we have pancakes where they use pineapple slices and sprinkles and whipped cream to make a smiley face?
IVANKA
You bet. Because we’re going to be president together, only I’ll be a little more president than you. But together we’ll be president of the United States of us!

The city, with its once-quiet, now-vibrant downtown, offers new restaurants, microbreweries and a rich array of cultural venues, including a museum that pays tribute to the blues.
By
Elaine Glusac
Before
travelers could fly there, St. Louis, on the Mississippi River, was a natural point of continental convergence for rails, trails and sails, the gateway to the West in the 19th century. That traffic, and the industry that grew up around it, created a legacy of wealth and power that is reflected in the city’s architecture and memorials to its complex history. These days, the downtown core,
which boomed with industrialization in the early 20th century, and hollowed out with a rush to the suburbs thereafter, is filling up with new residences, hotel projects and cultural venues (including a museum dedicated to the blues). You can still drink Budweiser in the massive factory where it’s made, but you’ll also find microbreweries that emphasize local ingredients; innovative takes on soul food at restaurants like
Gourmet Soul
; and flavors introduced by immigrant communities from the Balkans and beyond.
The 630-foot Gateway Arch, the grand 1965 city landmark, remains the same, including the vintage tram rides to the top (tram ride from $12). But a four-year, $380-million remodeling of
Gateway Arch National Park
(admission $3) reframes the monument’s connection to the city and to the westward migration it commemorates. A highway that divided the park from the city has been covered, providing additional park land and easy pedestrian access. A sloping plaza now ushers visitors into the subterranean
Museum at the Gateway Arch
, overhauled to explore Western colonization from different viewpoints, including that of Manifest Destiny (themed “the West was won”), Native Americans (“the West was stolen”) and Mexico (“the North was taken”). Design fans will appreciate the new gallery devoted to Eero Saarinen’s brilliant catenary arch design, including the models of relatively conservative entries it beat in the design competition. S
tudents of history
shouldn’t miss the
Old Courthouse
, part of the park and
the site
where Dred Scott and his wife, Harriet, sued for their freedom from slavery.
St. Louis is the original home of the ubiquitous macro-brew Budweiser. But microbrew operations, some employing veterans of Bud, have created competing pints at newer brewers like
Side Project Brewing
,
Narrow Gauge Brewing Company
and
Urban Chestnut Brewing Company
. If forced to pick one, don’t miss the original upstart, the Saint Louis Brewery, makers of
Schlafly
beer. Since 1991, the Schlafly Tap Room has occupied a historically registered 1901 printing company building west of downtown in a handsome neighborhood of brick warehouses still awaiting revival. There’s hardly a type of beer Schlafly hasn’t made over the years and the taps turn seasonally. Look for the hazy white lager and refreshing kölsch (pints $6).

Many St. Louis chefs champion the abundance of Missouri-grown foods, including, on the high end, the chef Michael Gallina.
The native of St. Louis worked at New York’s Blue Hill at Stone Barns for nearly 10 years before moving back home to open the farm-to-table restaurant
Vicia
. The vegetable-centric menu celebrates Midwestern ingredients with fine-dining flair in the window-wrapped room, and warm servers set a relaxed tone. Dishes change with the seasons, but recently included ham-studded crispy fried rice ($16), fork-tender, grass-fed beef with whey onions ($18), and turnip tacos ($18) that use paper-thin turnip slices as shells for make-your-own tacos, accompanied by strained yogurt, pickled red onion, black beans and optional pork or mushrooms. The bar does liquid wonders with herbs and even leftover yogurt whey.
Amanda Clark, an historian, can spout all the pertinent facts and figures about St. Louis. But she wanted to combine them with more offbeat, seamy and overshadowed city stories when she founded
Renegade Stl
tours six years ago. Now the company has expanded its portfolio to include tours themed to disasters and catastrophes, photography, baseball and manufacturing history. The two-hour Downtown History and Architecture Extravaganza (from $20) is a good first outing, covering St. Louis’s start in 1764 as a French trading settlement; the Gilded Age boom when city merchants profited outfitting westward migrants; and the midcentury development of the Gateway Arch. En route she points out architectural gems from the architects Louis Sullivan and Philip Johnson and discusses the city’s early experiment in legal prostitution and its ongoing struggle with brick theft from historic buildings.
Waves of immigrants — including Italians in the restaurant-filled Hill district and Germans, among them the founders of Anheuser-Busch beer — have left their mark on St. Louis. More recently, beginning in the 1990s, refugees from Bosnia flocked to affordable St. Louis, particularly the Bevo Mill district, home to a replica of a wooden fountain found in Sarajevo. The community’s proudest culinary expression is found in suburban Webster Groves where
Balkan Treat Box
, long a popular food truck, just opened a brick-and-mortar, lunch-only shop dealing grilled beef sausages called cevapi ($11) and Turkish wood-fired pide flatbread with Balkan kajmak cream ($11).
In the Botanical Heights District, named for its proximity to the comprehensive Missouri Botanical Garden,
Union Studio
provides one-stop shopping for a variety of local art, clothing, jewelry and crafts. Wander over to browse for handle-free ceramic mugs by the potter Al Westcott, handmade ties and pocket squares by Lonesome Traveler and sensuously draping pendant necklaces from Mahnal Jewelry by
Shayba Muhammad
. Pick up souvenirs from an assortment of St. Louis-themed cards, pins and dish towels. If perishables are more your style, hit

bakery and cafe next door for a loaf of fresh sourdough.
Two of the city’s many interesting museums are small enough to hit in one stimulating spree. First, stop in the Grand Center neighborhood at the
Pulitzer Arts Foundation
(free), a fascinating blend of Tadao Ando’s minimalist architecture and rotating exhibitions of contemporary art from St. Louis’s famed publishing family. Continue downtown to the two-year-old
National Blues Museum
($15), which pays homage to the American musical form that evolved from field hollers and rags by W.C. Handy to Muddy Waters’ electric blues and Chuck Berry’s early rock ’n’ roll. Interactive exhibits allow visitors to write and create their own blues song by choosing piano, harmonica and guitar styles, writing lyrics and mixing it all up in a sound booth. Send yourself the finished results via email. Besides being a great introduction to the blues, the museum celebrates African-American
culture in St. Louis
, which is also home to the
Scott Joplin House State Historic Site
where the ragtime composer lived, a
nd
The Griot Museum of Black History
,
featuring exhibits on slavery and wax figures of area-born celebrities, including Josephine Baker.
The chef most closely associated with St. Louis’s culinary emergence, Gerard Craft, has done French, Italian and now, in his new restaurant called
Cinder House
, South American food.
A tribute,
in part, to his childhood nanny from Brazil, Cinder House serves a mix of wood-fired dishes from grilled prawns ($15) to steaks (from $32), and Brazilian pork, beef and chimichurri feijoada ($32) and moqueca seafood stew ($30). Situated in the riverfront Four Seasons Hotel St. Louis, Cinder House includes a spacious outdoor patio that serves caipirinhas and mojitos ($11), in addition to Instagrammable views of the Gateway Arch.
There is a wealth of choices in the rich performing arts scene, including the
Repertory Theatre of St. Louis
, which includes the playwright Tony Kushner as an alumnus.
St. Louis Black Repertory
bills itself as the nation’s largest professional African-American theater company. Earlier this year it staged the premiere of “Canfield Drive,” exploring media coverage of the 2014 shooting death of Michael Brown in nearby Ferguson, Mo.; “Nina Simone: Four Women” runs May 15 to June 2. The second-oldest symphony in the country, the
St. Louis Symphony Orchestra
plays in Powell Symphony Hall, an ornate 1935 vaudeville theater. In summer, the 100-year-old Municipal Opera Association, known as
the Muny
, stages popular musicals (“Guys and Dolls” kicks off the season June 10) in a vast 10,800-seat outdoor stadium in Forest Park.
Arrive early or prepare to line up at
Half & Half
in suburban Clayton, where the chef and owner, Mike Randolph takes breakfast seriously. A little more than half of the menu in the sunny, bustling storefront skews savory, with dishes like a fried egg sandwich ($8.50), and veggie hash with eggs and potatoes that comes in a piping hot skillet ($11). On the sweet side, there’s pancakes with raspberry jam, mascarpone and granola ($11) and s’mores French toast ($10.50). Wash it down with bottomless cups of locally roasted Blueprint Coffee ($3.95).
The site of the St. Louis World’s Fair in 1904, the nearly 1,300-acre
Forest Park
serves as the wilderness and playing field for urban residents, as well as a cultural magnet with attractions that include
the Saint Louis Art Museum
,
Missouri History Museum
,
Saint Louis Zoo
and
Saint Louis Science Center.
You can drive around the park, but the best way to see it is on foot, following paths that wind through forests and prairies and around tranquil ponds. Park-goers can also rent a kayak at the
boathouse
($15 an hour), play
tennis
($5) or
golf
(from $22).
With its many museums, St. Louis covers the spectrum of culture, anchored on the playful end by
City Museum
(admission $15). The all-ages playground, based in a 600,000-square-foot former shoe factory, houses a mix of eclectic exhibits and carnival attractions, including a Ferris wheel and giant slide on the roof. Slides, as well as stairs, connect four levels of this arty fun house, which features an aquarium, collections of architectural artifacts, mosaics and taxidermy and a mini shoelace factory. Its “no maps” policy encourages guests to let loose and go where the treehouse or the underground caves lead.
Many of the loft apartment conversions that have revived St. Louis’ downtown buildings now stock Airbnb’s inventory. For example, the one-bedroom
Designer Loft in Center of Downtown
features whitewashed brick walls, modernist furnishings and a fully equipped contemporary kitchen. From $65; Airbnb.com/rooms/17106158.
The new
Hotel Saint Louis
occupies a retrofitted 1893 landmark building originally designed by Louis Sullivan with a restored marble lobby capped by a stained-glass ceiling. The full-service hotel includes a spa, a top-floor bar and, in summer, a rooftop pool. From $169; hotelsaintlouis.com.

• Detienen a Julian Assange en la embajada de Ecuador en Londres.
Tras casi siete años de asilo,
la policía londinense arrestó hoy
[en inglés] al fundador de WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, por no haberse presentado ante un tribunal en 2012, después de que Ecuador le revocara el asilo. Assange no salía de la embajada del país desde agosto de 2012 por temor a que si abandonaba terreno diplomático ecuatoriano, podía ser detenido y extraditado a Estados Unidos por la publicación de miles de cables militares y diplomáticos clasificados a través de WikiLeaks.
Lenín Moreno, presidente de Ecuador, dijo
en un comunicado en video
publicado en su cuenta de Twitter que su gobierno tomó la decisión soberana de retirar el asilo diplomático a Assange por haber violado “reiteradamente convenciones internacionales y el protocolo de convivencia”. Los agentes de policía fueron invitados a entrar al edificio por el embajador ecuatoriano después de que su gobierno retirara el asilo a Assange, dijeron las autoridades.

Un tribunal en Lima ordenó diez días de detención preliminar para el hombre que, hasta hace poco más de un año, fue el mandatario del país. El arresto responde a la investigación por corrupción relacionada con los tratos con la constructora brasileña Odebrecht; Kuczynski calificó como excesiva la orden de prisión y su abogado dijo que apelarán.
Cinco expresidentes de Perú enfrentan procesos judiciales: Ollanta Humala estuvo en prisión preventiva; Alberto Fujimori tiene una condena por crímenes contra la humanidad; Alejandro Toledo está acusado de recibir sobornos, y Alan García está siendo investigado por colusión al igual que por lavado de activos.

Piden que la ONU reconozca a Juan Guaidó como líder de Venezuela.
En una sesión del Consejo de Seguridad de las Naciones Unidas para discutir la situación venezolana —signada por el colapso económico en medio de una disputa entre el opositor Guaidó y Nicolás Maduro sobre quién es el presidente legítimo—, la representación estadounidense en el organismo reveló una
propuesta para que la ONU reconozca a Guaidó como el líder de Venezuela
. Mike Pence, el vicepresidente de Estados Unidos, le dijo al embajador chavista en la reunión: “No deberías estar aquí. Deberías regresar a Venezuela y decirle a Maduro que se vaya”. Más de cincuenta naciones han reconocido a Guaidó como presidente encargado.

Una oleada de despidos en los hoteles de Trump que empleaban a personas indocumentadas.
Después de las revelaciones de que varias empresas del presidente estadounidense —quien se caracteriza por despotricar contra los migrantes— tenían en su nómina a personas indocumentadas,

WASHINGTON — Playing migrants for laughs in a speech to lobbyists and donors, President Donald Trump characterized people trying to get into the U.S. as a horde of beefy men who fake hard-luck stories so softies in the immigration system will let them in.
His shtick caused plenty of amusement at the Republican Jewish Coalition event Saturday but it was a far cry from the reality of the masses at the border.
The speech capped a week of unreal political rhetoric as Trump retreated on two broad fronts, the border and health care, and offered tortured explanations for doing so. He also got his family history wrong and drew a link between wind power and cancer that has not been proved.
Here's a look back:
IMMIGRATION:
TRUMP, describing asylum seekers as ""people that look like they should be fighting for the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship). They read a little page given by lawyers that are all over the place,"" coaching them to say ""I am very fearful for my life. I am very worried that I will be accosted if I'm sent back home."" Trump then mimics U.S. officials: ""Oh, give him asylum. He's afraid. He's afraid."" And he adds: ""We don't love the fact that he's got tattoos on his face. That's not a good sign."" — speech Saturday to the lobbying group.
THE FACTS: Figures from his own administration tell a different story than Trump's mocking tale. Those coming are increasingly families and children. Among them are thousands who get a chance for a life in America because they make a compelling case that they risk persecution in their home countries.
Last month, Homeland Security's immigration statistics office released its latest annual report on the flow of asylum seekers and refugees, covering 2017. Among those who came from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras and applied for asylum at the border, 56 percent were unaccompanied children. The percentage was the same the year before and higher in 2015.
Altogether, Homeland Security granted the asylum applications of more than 26,500 people in 2017. Almost one-third were children. Nearly half were women. Close to two-thirds were married.
Additionally, the Justice Department granted asylum to more than 10,500 people who were already in the country and made their case for refuge in their deportation hearings.
___
TRUMP: ""If they put one foot on our territory, if they start climbing a fence and they're on the Mexico side, welcome to the United States. Think of it. It's the craziest thing."" — speech Saturday.
THE FACTS: It's not that simple. What is lost in Trump's rhetoric is that it is legal to come to the border and ask for asylum. As for those who sneak illegally into the U.S. and get caught, they, too, are entitled to apply for asylum.
As the Homeland Security report states: ""Generally, any foreign national present in the United States or arriving at a POE (port of entry) may seek asylum regardless of immigration status.""
Whether they ask at the border or after sneaking into the U.S., most don't get it.
___
TRUMP, on why he is pulling back on sealing the U.S.-Mexico border: ""Because Mexico has been absolutely terrific for the last four days. They're apprehending everybody. Yesterday they apprehended 1,400 people. The day before was 1,000. And if they apprehend people at their southern border where they don't have to walk through, that's a big home run. We can handle it from there. It's really good."" — remarks to reporters Friday.
TRUMP: ""Before that they never did anything."" — remarks to reporters Thursday.
THE FACTS: Trump is describing a Mexican crackdown on Central American migrants that has not materialized. He's also wrong in saying that Mexico did nothing about the problem until he threatened to close the border.
Mexico markedly tightened migration controls during the Obama administration. Mexico also detained more than 30,000 foreigners in the first three months of this year, before Trump accused Mexican officials of doing ""NOTHING.""
Mexico reports that its interception and detention of migrants from the south are ""about average"" in recent months. Over the first three days of April, it apprehended 1,259 foreigners — not 1,000 or more a day, as Trump claimed.
""There is no very substantive change,"" said Mexico's foreign secretary, Marcelo Ebrard. ""I don't know what (Trump) was referring to.""
Ebrard said: ""What Mexico is doing as far as the review of the southern border — well, it's the same thing it has been doing.""
___
TRUMP: ""The Flores decision is a disaster, I have to tell you. Judge Flores, whoever you may be, that decision is a disaster for our country, a disaster."" — remarks at a meeting with local officials in Southern California on Friday.
THE FACTS: There's no Judge Flores involved. Jenny Flores was 15-year-old native of El Salvador who was held in what her advocates said were substandard conditions in the 1980s, contending she was strip-searched in custody and housed with male adults. They launched a class-action lawsuit on behalf of migrant children in the country illegally. Her mother was a housekeeper in the U.S. who feared deportation if she picked up her daughter.
The case worked its way to the Supreme Court, which sided with the government and against the girl's advocates. But the case gave rise to an agreement in 1997 setting conditions for the detention of migrant children and the codifying of those conditions in law a decade later. It generally bars the government from keeping children in immigration detention for more than 20 days and guides how they are to be treated.
___
HEALTH CARE
TRUMP: ""This will be a great campaign issue. I never asked Mitch McConnell for a vote before the Election as has been incorrectly reported (as usual) in the @nytimes, but only after the Election when we take back the House etc."" — tweet Wednesday.
THE FACTS: That's misleading at best.
A week earlier, Trump stirred expectations of an ambitious health care effort when he said that if the Supreme Court strikes down ""Obamacare,"" ''we will have a plan that's far better."" He promised ""the Republican Party will become the party of great health care.""
But Trump soon found that the party in Congress had no appetite for yet another attempt to replace President Barack Obama's health law in the near future — nor does it have a plan.
""I made it clear to him that we were not going to be doing that in the Senate,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told reporters Tuesday, describing their conversation a day earlier. ""He did say, as he later tweeted, that he accepted that and that he would be developing a plan that he would take to the American people during the 2020 campaign.""
So Trump backed down and postponed any replacement until after an election more than 18 months away.
McConnell explained to Trump that senators are open to tackling specific aspects of health care — namely, trying to lower prescription drug prices, according to a person who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss Monday's private call between the two. But Trump's promised big, new health care bill wasn't going happen with Democrats running the House.
Trump told McConnell he ""accepted"" the situation and ""would be developing a plan that he would take to the American people during the 2020 campaign,"" according to that person. That night, Trump tweeted as much.
___
TRUMP: ""Republicans will always support pre-existing conditions!"" — tweet Wednesday.
MICK MULVANEY, acting White House chief of staff: ""Every single plan that this White House has ever put forward since Donald Trump was elected covered pre-existing conditions. Every single plan that Republicans in the House voted on in the previous Congress covered pre-existing conditions. Every single plan considered by the Senate covers pre-existing conditions. The debate about pre-existing conditions is over. Both parties support them and anyone telling you anything different is lying to you for political gain."" — interview March 31 on ABC's ""This Week.""
THE FACTS: Trump and his chief of staff's sweeping statements about the GOP commitment to protect people with pre-existing medical conditions are misleading. The Republican health insurance proposals would not have protected those patients as broadly as the Obama-era law and could have led to significantly higher rates or gaps in coverage for people with chronic illnesses.
The Obama health law requires insurers to take all applicants, regardless of medical history, and patients with health problems pay the same standard premiums as healthy ones. It also requires standard benefits such as pregnancy, maternity and newborn care and mental health treatment. The trade-off was that the law also mandated that everyone have insurance, including healthy people, whose premiums helped insurers cover the costs of the very sick.
The GOP health overhaul plans in Congress eliminated the mandate that everyone have insurance and sought to protect people with pre-existing conditions to a degree. But the Republican legislation would have given states leeway to vary the premiums that insurers charge based on health and other factors. That might make coverage unaffordable for people with serious or pre-existing health conditions.
For instance, the Republican plans would have allowed insurers to charge older people at a 5-to-1 ratio compared with young people, higher than the law's 3-to-1 ratio, and given states authority to allow insurers to use health status as a factor in setting premiums for people who have had a break in coverage and are trying to get a new individual policy.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found the GOP plans over time would raise premiums for people with health problems because healthy people would be more likely to take their chances going uninsured.
___
WIND POWER
TRUMP: ""If you have a windmill anywhere near your house, congratulations. Your house just went down 75% of value. And they say the noise causes cancer."" — remarks at Republican fundraising dinner Tuesday.
THE FACTS: The sound from wind farms has not been proved to cause cancer.
Trump has had it out for wind power since turbines were proposed off the coast of Scotland within sight of his golf resort near Aberdeen . He unsuccessfully fought the project. He has ascribed a variety of evils to wind power over the years, usually with scant evidence, while praising coal, a well-documented cause of health problems.
""The American Cancer Society is unaware of any credible evidence linking the noise from windmills to cancer,"" the organization said after Trump's latest remarks.
While some recesses of the internet have long tried to sound alarms about ""wind turbine syndrome,"" several studies have found no evidence of serious health issues.
Trump actually misidentified his target. Wind turbines produce energy. Windmills mill grain and flummox Don Quixote .
___
PUERTO RICO
TRUMP: ""Puerto Rico got 91 Billion Dollars for the hurricane, more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before."" — tweet Tuesday.
HOGAN GIDLEY, White House spokesman: ""The fact is, they have received more money than any state or territory in history for a rebuild."" — interview Tuesday with MSNBC.
THE FACTS: The money Puerto Rico has received for hurricane relief is nowhere close to $91 billion. Nor is the amount provided greater than for any other hurricane that has struck the U.S.
According to the White House, Trump's $91 billion estimate includes about $50 billion in expected future disaster disbursements that could span decades, along with $41 billion already approved. But actual aid to Puerto Rico has flowed more slowly from federal coffers, about $11 billion so far.
Even if the $91 billion figure eventually comes to fruition, it would not be the most ever provided for hurricane rebuilding efforts. Hurricane Katrina, which hit Louisiana and other Gulf Coast states in 2005, has cost the U.S government more than $120 billion.
___
TRUMP, on Puerto Rico: ""The pols are grossly incompetent, spend the money foolishly or corruptly, & only take from USA."" — tweet Tuesday.
THE FACTS: Trump appears to suggest Puerto Rico is not part of the U.S. as he criticizes its territorial government for taking ""from USA."" He does not criticize other Americans for taking ""from USA.""
Gidley, speaking on MSNBC, called the notion that Trump was referring to Puerto Ricans as noncitizens ""absolutely ridiculous."" But in the same interview Gidley had referred to Puerto Rico as ""that country."" When pressed about his wording, Gidley said it was a mistake and he meant to say ""territory.""
Puerto Ricans are Americans.
___
TRUMP'S FATHER
TRUMP, arguing that Germany should spend more on its own military budget: ""I have great respect for Angela, and I have great respect for the country,"" he said, referring to German Chancellor Angela Merkel. ""My father is German, right, was German, and born in a very wonderful place in Germany, and so I have a great feeling for Germany, but they're not paying what they should be paying."" — remarks Tuesday with NATO's secretary general.
THE FACTS: Trump is confusing his father and grandfather.
Trump's father, Fred, was born in New York City. The president's grandfather, Friedrich, was born in Germany.
Friedrich Trump immigrated to the U.S. in 1885 at the age of 16, arriving in New York before moving to the western parts of the U.S.
Trump has messed up his family history in this way several times. Last year, he said both his parents were born in what became the European Union. Only his Scottish mother was.
___
VOTER TURNOUT
DEMOCRAT BETO O'ROURKE: ""The state saw young voter turnout up 500% over the last midterm election."" — various campaign events in recent weeks.
THE FACTS: Voter turnout by people under 30 did not jump nearly that much last year. Texas did see a large increase in those young voters, though.
More than 1 million young voters cast a ballot in the 2018 midterm election, a 234% increase from the 2014 midterm elections, according to voting data from the Texas secretary of state's office.
Initial reports suggested young voter turnout increased as much as 508% during early voting in Texas when compared with early voting in 2014, according to data released by a political consulting firm a week before the 2018 election.
O'Rourke spokesman Chris Evans acknowledged his candidate used those figures without making the distinction that they represent an incomplete portion of early votes cast — not total turnout in the election.
Overall, voter turnout in the 2018 midterm election increased 77% in Texas over 2014 totals.
___
CENSUS
TRUMP: ""Can you believe that the Radical Left Democrats want to do our new and very important Census Report without the all important Citizenship Question. Report would be meaningless and a waste of the $Billions (ridiculous) that it costs to put together!"" — tweet Monday.
THE FACTS: Trump's disdain for conducting the once-a-decade census without a citizenship question is not shared by his own Census Bureau researchers. Nor is it consistent with the many operations of government and business that make billions of dollars in spending decisions as well as policy decisions based on the most accurate possible count of the U.S. population.
According to January 2018 calculations by the Census Bureau, adding a citizenship question to the decennial census form would cause lower response rates among noncitizens, leading to an increased cost to the government of at least $27.5 million for additional phone calls, visits to the home and other follow-up efforts to reach them. The Constitution requires a count every 10 years of ""the whole number of persons in each state,"" long understood to include all residents of the U.S.
The count goes to the heart of the U.S. political system. It's used to determine the number of seats each state has in the House and how the electoral votes that decide presidential elections are distributed. Civil rights groups and states with higher shares of immigrant populations such as California and New York cite a significant harm to the political rights of minority groups if a citizenship question in the decennial census dissuades immigrants from participating, resulting in diminished representation in the U.S. House.
The census also shapes how 300 federal programs distribute more than $800 billion a year to local communities, according to an analysis by the GW Institute of Public Policy at George Washington University. Communities and businesses depend on it, as well, in deciding where to build schools, hospitals, job training centers, grocery stores and more.
The GW institute's analysis of the effects of an undercount on five programs administered by the Health and Human Services Department, for instance, found that 37 states lost a median of $1,091 in the 2015 budget year for each person missed in the 2010 census.

SACRAMENTO, California — Impoverished towns in the shadow of Mount Shasta. Rustic Gold Rush cities in the Sierra Nevada foothills. High-dollar resort communities on the shores of Lake Tahoe. Ritzy Los Angeles County suburbs.
They all could be the next Paradise.
A McClatchy analysis reveals more than 350,000 Californians live in towns and cities that exist almost entirely within ""very high fire hazard severity zones"" — Cal Fire's designation for places highly vulnerable to devastating wildfires. These designations have proven eerily predictive about some of the state's most destructive wildfires in recent years, including the Camp Fire, the worst in state history.
Nearly all of Paradise is colored in bright red on Cal Fire's map — practically the entire town was at severe risk before the Camp Fire raged through last November, burning the majority of homes in its path and killing 85 people.
Malibu, where the Woolsey Fire burned more than 400 homes last year, also falls within very high hazard zones. As does the small Lake County town of Cobb, much of which was destroyed by the Valley Fire in 2015.
""There's a lot of Paradises out there,"" said Max Moritz, a fire specialist at UC Santa Barbara.
All told, more than 2.7 million Californians live in very high fire hazard severity zones, from trailers off quiet dirt roads in the forest to mansions in the state's largest cities, according to the analysis, which is based on 2010 block-level census data. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection says its maps show places where wildfires are likely to be extreme due to factors including vegetation and topography.
The maps aren't perfect in their ability to forecast where a fire will be destructive. For instance, the Coffey Park neighborhood of Santa Rosa isn't in a very high hazard zone, but powerful winds pushed the Tubbs Fire into that part of the city, largely leveling the neighborhood in October 2017.
Coffey Park was built ""with zero consideration for fire,"" said Chris Dicus, a forestry and fire expert at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. ""Fire was in the mountains — there was no consideration that fire would cross (Highway) 101.""
Cal Fire is making new fire hazard maps — ready in a year or so — that will incorporate regional wind patterns and other climate factors. In the meantime, experts say the current maps, created about a decade ago, still provide an important guide to predict where wildfires could do the most damage , in the same way floodplain maps highlight areas that could be hit hardest during severe storms.
The at-risk communities identified by McClatchy also should serve as a starting point for prioritizing how California should spend money on retrofits and other fire-safety programs, Moritz said.
California's state-of-the-art building codes help protect homes from wildfire in the most vulnerable areas, experts say. But the codes only apply to new construction. A bill introduced by Assemblyman Jim Wood would provide cash to help Californians retrofit older homes.
""This will go a long way toward these different municipalities (in showing) that they deserve funding,"" Moritz said.
McClatchy identified more than 75 towns and cities with populations over 1,000 where, like Paradise, at least 90 percent of residents live within the Cal Fire ""very high fire hazard severity zones.""
Here are snapshots of 10, and the unique challenges they face:
___
Shingletown: a miniature Paradise
Population (2010) — 2,283 ' In Very High fire Hazard Severity Zone — 2,283
Shingletown is less than one-tenth the size of Paradise but probably carries just as much risk.
Like Paradise, the unincorporated community sits atop a ridge, and is covered in tall trees and thick brush — ingredients for a major wildfire. Shingletown was originally named Shingle Camp, for the workers who cut roofing slats from timber to supply miners during the Gold Rush era.
""We grow trees like nobody's business up here,"" said Tom Twist, a member of the Shingletown Fire Safe Council, a volunteer organization. Twist, who's lived in the community off and on since the 1970s, said that when the weather is warm he'll walk his property, pulling up seedlings in an almost futile effort to eliminate potential fuels.
""I'll pull 20 or 30 seedlings a day out of the ground,"" he said. ""It's almost like when I walk over there, there's 20 or 30. When I walk back, there's another 20 or 30.""
Just like Paradise, escaping the ridge in a fast-moving fire wouldn't be easy; Shingletown's main drag is winding, narrow Highway 44. And, like in Paradise, the presence of an older population would make evacuation more difficult; Shingletown's median age is 61, according to census figures.
It's little wonder that when Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered Cal Fire to develop a list of urgent fire-safety projects, a plan to trim 1,124 acres of vegetation along Highway 44 came up as the top priority out of 35 projects around the state.
Locals say they're glad the state is paying attention to a problem they know too well. The community had to evacuate when the Ponderosa Fire, started by a lightning strike, hit in 2012. The fire burned 27,676 acres — 43 square miles — and torched 52 homes in the vicinity.
""We're intimately aware of the dangers up here,"" Twist said.
___
Nevada City: picturesque and risky
Population (2010) — 3,068 ' In Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone — 3,064
Since the Camp Fire, Vicky Guyette has looked at the one-acre patch of untrimmed brush behind her mother's Victorian-era home in Nevada City as more than just an unattractive nuisance.
Now, the brush is ominous — an ignition source that could torch the home built in 1859 that her family has lived in for five generations.
The same anxiety also applies to the cedars, pines and brush covering the hills around this foothill city of about 3,100 people, many of whom live or work in wooden buildings dating back to the the Gold Rush era.
""It's very scary, especially since it's such a cute little town I've been living in my whole life,"" Guyette said recently as she walked down the city's historic Broad Street, which looks like it fell out of a photo from a museum exhibit.
City officials agree that the wooded draws, steep hillsides, narrow residential streets, ancient homes and thick urban tree canopy that define the character of the city also make it particularly at risk if a fire burns through.
""Nevada City's single largest risk for human life and financial loss is fire,"" Nevada City's hazard mitigation plan reads.
In recent decades, the city also has had some near misses with fire, including one major close call.
In 1988, heavy winds pushed the 49er Fire through 52 square miles of western Nevada County, burning 312 buildings and dozens of cars.
""At the time it was considered an anomalous event,"" said Billy Spearing of the Fire Safe Council of Nevada County. ""It was not the normal for them then.""
With such fires becoming the new normal, Cal Fire is planning to cut a 1,802 acre fire break in southwest Nevada County in terrain that hasn't burned in a century, helping protect both Nevada City and the adjacent community of Grass Valley, home to more than 12,000.
Nevada City also embarked on an online ""Goat Fund Me"" campaign to raise $25,000 to hire farmers to use their goats to eat dense brush in more than 450 acres of city-owned greenbelt.
The goats recently chewed a swath through Pioneer Park near Margaret Rodda's Victorian home, which sits on a steep draw above a creek. But she's still worried.
""All it takes is a drunk with a cigarette,"" she said.
The goats inspired Guyette. She said she might spend the $500 to put a herder's goats to work on the thorny thicket of blackberries behind her mother's house.
""We need to get rid of them,"" she said.
___
Colfax: Fire is on everyone's minds
Population (2010) — 1,963 ' In Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone —1,963
On his first full day in office, Newsom visited the Cal Fire station in Colfax to announce new initiatives on wildfire safety. As he spoke to reporters, surrounded by first responders, he was standing in a city that could burn any summer.
""The people who live here have a true understanding,"" said Colfax City Manager Wes Heathcock. ""It's always on the back of people's minds, especially with the most recent fires, the Camp Fire. We have a similar makeup here.""
At night in the summer, Aimee Costa, who lives on a hill above the elementary school, sometimes keeps her window open, the better to hear ominous sounds.
""You're laying in bed . listening for that lick, that smack, that pop sound,"" Costa said, describing the sound flames would make if they were chewing pine needles, brush and leaves.
A former supply hub for gold mining camps, Colfax sits a few miles from the edge of the Tahoe National Forest in the lower-elevation Sierra. It straddles Interstate 80 and serves as the last major stop between the Sacramento metropolitan area and the Lake Tahoe region. Horses graze beside deer on large ranchettes in the rugged brushy canyons along the outskirts of the city.
The terrain poses a major fire risk.
In July 2015, the Lowell Fire erupted near Colfax and chewed up thousands of acres along the north side of the freeway, forcing evacuations in adjacent Nevada County. In the years since, Heathcock said the city has been working with state officials on ""fuelbreak"" projects, including a spot near the high school and elementary school, which has been eyed as an evacuation site.
Gene Mapa, who lived in Paradise and escaped the Camp Fire with some family photographs — and nothing else — has relocated to Colfax, where he already owned a second home. But he knows he hasn't escaped the fire risk; his property just outside the city limits would be threatened by a windy firestorm like the one that engulfed Paradise.
""With that wind, there would be no stopping it anywhere,"" Mapa said.
___
Kings Beach: Tourists seek fun, bring fire danger
Population (2010) — 3,796 ' In Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone —3,796
Situated on the pristine north shore of Lake Tahoe, Kings Beach is one of the most heavily visited vacation spots in Northern California.
That's a big part of the problem.
Because so much of the population comes and goes, it becomes harder to get people to treat wildfire risk with the respect it deserves, said Erin Holland, a spokeswoman for the North Tahoe Fire Protection District. One of the district's six stations is in Kings Beach.
""It is definitely a challenge because we have so many homes that are vacation homes,"" she said. ""It's really a challenge to educate those visitors . They want to have a camp fire.""
Tahoe's vulnerability to major fires was brought home dramatically in recent years. The Angora Fire in 2007, while it was confined to the south shore area, left physical and emotional scars on the entire basin after burning through 3,100 acres.
Holland said getting the region's property owners and visitors to observe ""defensible space"" regulations is particularly difficult. Those rules call for clearing brush 100 feet around buildings and include stricter rules regarding vegetation immediately adjacent to structures.
Violators can be subject to citations, but ""the goal is to really educate people, to get people complying,"" Holland said. ""We go the education route rather than the citation route.""
___
Pollock Pines: Do the transplants get it?
Population (2010) — 6,877 ' In Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone — 6,533
Just off Highway 50, a few miles from the tourist haven of Apple Hill, Pollock Pines lures transplants from coastal California, mainly retirees drawn to the lovely stands of trees in the foothill community at the edge of the Eldorado National Forest.
Heather Campbell only wishes the newbies had a better understanding of what all that timber represents.
Campbell, a retired U.S. Forest Service employee who's lived in Pollock Pines since the 1990s, is the head of the Pollock Pines-Camino Fire Safe Council, a volunteer group.
In the past few years her organization has received hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants, mainly from the state's ""cap and trade"" carbon trading program, to trim vegetation on the ridgeline south of Highway 50.
That's all well and good, she said, but more needs to be done. And the people of Pollock Pines, including the newcomers, have to realize what's at stake.
""Here, everybody allows all the saplings and brush to grow and they don't weed it out,"" she said. ""All these roads are incredibly dangerous, when it's so easy to take out pruners. Take out your pruners!""
She said memories are still vivid of the Sand Fire in 2014. That fire burned 4,200 acres and 20 homes and came dangerously close to forcing a major evacuation in Pollock Pines and surrounding communities.
""They were going to evacuate 9,000 people,"" she said. ""They were predicting the fire to go to 27,000 acres, instead of the 4,000 they stopped it at.""
___
Arnold: Trees are falling in Big Trees country
Population (2010) — 3,843 ' In Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone — 3,843
In the community that serves as gateway to Calaveras Big Trees State Park, residents didn't always applaud when officials began mapping plans to thin dense stands of trees to reduce fire risk.
""Arnold resisted this for a long time because people love their trees,"" said Steve Wilensky, a former Calaveras County supervisor who works with nonprofits to improve fire safety in the Sierra.
After years of protests, Arnold's residents got a major wake-up call in 2015. The Butte Fire, caused by power lines, took out 549 homes in nearby communities. Two people died.
""If the weather hadn't changed, they'd be gone,"" Wilensky said of Arnold. ""You've got a real parallel with Paradise in some ways . It's a place that is really highly threatened.""
Arnold sits on a ridge, surrounded by a dense forest of drought- and beetle-killed trees. Powerful wind gusts can funnel fire up rugged brushy canyons.
A key difference between Paradise and Arnold is that as many as 45 percent of the dwellings are vacation homes, which can sometimes make it a challenge to get out-of-town homeowners to do brush clearing, local officials said.
Wilensky said momentum to reduce fire risk has built since the Butte Fire. More than $15 million in state and federal funds have gone to thinning dangerous overgrowth in the region, Wilensky said.
One project includes using bulldozer lines that were cut during the Butte Fire to expand a fire break that stretches to town.
""Arnold is the anchor end of this project,"" Wilensky said.
___
Wofford Heights: Apathy in a danger zone?
Population (2010) — 2,201 ' In Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone — 2,147
The same powerful desert gusts that attract wind surfers to Kern County's Lake Isabella make the lakeside community of Wofford Heights particularly at risk for wildfire. So does the adjacent Sequoia National Forest, which has been plagued by drought and tree-killing beetles.
Yet some feel that the region isn't doing nearly enough to combat the threat.
""We could do a hell of a lot more than we're doing,"" said Judy Hyatt, who lived in the area for 15 years and served as president of the region's fire safe council. The volunteer group disbanded in recent years from what she and others described as a lack of interest.
In 2016, the Lake Isabella region suffered through the Erskine and Cedar fires, which burned more than 77,000 acres and more than 300 structures. An elderly couple was killed when they were trapped by the Erskine Fire.
According to census figures, the median age of those living in Wofford Heights is 62, and many live in places with poor escape routes.
""Some of those mobiles up there, honest to God, I think they've dropped them out of the sky,"" Hyatt said. ""The roads are so narrow, and it really just presents an obstacle and the only way to really get to it is by air. That is when people start to die.""
Hyatt said the loss of the nonprofit Kern River Fire Safe Council she once headed doesn't bode well for the community. She said the council organized wood-chipping drives to encourage residents to remove wood debris and sought grants for fuel breaks and other thinning projects.
She said too many locals have grown complacent.
""Fire prevention is a nebulous thing,"" she said. ""It's hard to quantify, until there's a damned fire that takes out everything.""
___
La Cañada Flintridge: Is aggressive fire prevention enough?
Population (2010) — 20,048 ' In Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone — 20,048
Carol Settles and her family evacuated their home in La Cañada Flintridge during the Station Fire in 2009. But she isn't terribly worried about a repeat performance — even though her home is on a dead-end street below a brushy hillside of the Angeles National Forest. Large electrical transmission lines run along the wooded draw behind her home.
""We've never seen a spark,"" Settles said, referring to the power lines. ""We've never seen any of that.""
Best-known as home to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory on the outskirts of Pasadena, the upper middle-class city has an aggressive fire-prevention program. The Los Angeles County fire department checks properties in Settles' area once a year to make sure vegetation has been cleared and hazardous landscaping hasn't been planted.
Fines can be issued for non-compliance. Recently, one of Settles' neighbors had to saw off the top of a pine tree because it was too close to a transmission tower, she said.
Los Angeles County's assistant fire chief, J. Lopez, said La Cañada Flintridge has embraced rigorous fire-safety standards, which include annual landscaping inspections and stringent fire-safe building codes, even for large home remodels. Lopez said La Cañada Flintridge also chose to place the entire city inside a high fire hazard zone, going beyond the recommendation of Cal Fire. That decision translates into citywide enforcement of its fire-resilient building codes.
""That's a very progressive way to look at it,"" Lopez said.
But since 2008, on average only about a dozen new homes have been built in La Cañada Flintridge each year, meaning most of the housing stock was built before the rigorous fire standards were in place.
The city's hazard mitigation plan notes many of those older homes still have ""combustible roofing, open eaves, combustible siding,"" and they're on ""steep, narrow, poorly signed"" roads that make evacuations dangerous.
Thomas Caswell, who's lived for four decades on a hilly, narrow, dead-end street not far from city hall, said he knows the greenbelt behind his house where he watches possums, birds and other wildlife also makes the community vulnerable to fire. It's why he says he didn't mind paying when the city told him he needed to hire a tree service to remove dying trees in his front yard.
Still, he knows such efforts probably wouldn't do much good if the Santa Ana winds pushed a fire into the city. Fire officials said that La Cañada Flintridge could have burned in the Station Fire if the Santa Ana winds hadn't stopped blowing. The fire burned 89 homes in outlying communities and 160,577 acres of forested lands, the largest fire by land mass in Los Angeles County history.
""Once it comes down the hill,"" Caswell said, ""nobody is going to be safe.""
___
Rancho Palos Verdes: Few fears in an affluent suburb
Population (2010) — 41,803 ' In Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone — 40,550
Rancho Palos Verdes holds a dubious honor: It's the most populated city in California to have 90 percent or more of its population living within a ""very high fire hazard severity zone."" But few residents seem to think their suburb is in the same league as Malibu, where hundreds of homes burned last fall just up the Los Angeles County coastline.
""It's not like living in Malibu, definitely,"" said Gregory Lash as he strolled through a public access walkway in the Trump National Golf Club with his wife, Vivian, on the way to an oceanside park where a pod of dolphins and whales were breaching.
He added, moments later: ""Hope that's not naive.""
City officials say it's not.
""This being a coastal community, we don't get the type of brush and that kind of fire behavior that you might get in somewhere like Paradise,"" said Scott Hale, an assistant fire chief for Los Angeles County. The county leads firefighting efforts on the Palos Verdes Peninsula, whose four affluent communities all fall inside a high fire severity zone.
Locals point out that over the years, the firefighters at the five stations on the peninsula have quickly knocked down the relatively small fires that popped up.
Still, Rancho Palos Verdes' hazard mitigation plan lists wildfire as a bigger threat to the city than earthquakes, tsunamis and landslides. Powerful winds that blow from the coast could funnel a fire up the greenbelts that cut through the peninsula's neighborhoods, many of which have opulent homes perched above canyons.
Much of that open space has been preserved by the Palos Verdes Peninsula Land Conservancy, which manages more than 1,600 acres of land in and around the city. Residents such as Lash love the 42 miles of trails on conservancy lands, but all that undeveloped acreage could ignite, said Gabriella Yap, deputy city manager.
""You're trying to preserve that, but it also comes with fire risk,"" Yap said.
The city's staff supports Southern California Edison's plans to trim vegetation from under the lines that run through some of the open space to reduce fire threats, but the land conservancy is bristling at the loss of native habitats.
""The environmental impact of that is really significant,"" said Adrienne Mohan, the conservancy's executive director.
___
Harbison Canyon: Will it burn a third time?
Population (2010) — 3,841 ' In Very High Hazard Fire Severity Zone — 3,841
Every 30 years or so, a massive fire blows through Harbison Canyon, 30 miles northeast of San Diego.
The 1970 Laguna Fire destroyed much of the unincorporated town that sits inside the canyon and shares its name. Harbison Canyon was rebuilt again after the Cedar Fire burned through in 2003, destroying 287 of the 388 homes.
Rick Halsey of the Chaparral Institute said the canyon is a painful example of how development has been allowed to continue practically unchecked for decades into some of California's most fire-prone places.
""You want to create a geographical hotspot for fire, you couldn't put it in a better place,"" said Halsey, whose environmentalist organization was founded to fight calls for clearing hundreds of square miles of wild lands following the Cedar Fire. ""It's like a bowling alley for the Santa Ana winds.""
That sort of talk makes longtime resident Mary Manning cringe.
She worries that focusing on the canyon's fire risk creates the impression that the community she loves can't be saved from the next catastrophe. She said her community could be made more safe if state and local officials would invest in infrastructure and fire prevention that matched the rates of development she's seen over the years. For instance, the side streets in Harbison Canyon are narrow. Some, like Manning's, remain unpaved despite decades of building.
""There were five houses, now there are 35,"" she said of the street she's lived on since 1975.
Manning notes it was only two years ago that the local fire station became staffed 24 hours a day — 14 years after the Cedar Fire. Inside the station, Dave Nissen, the Cal Fire official who oversees firefighting in the area, said there are a number of challenges to fighting a fire in the canyon, including the narrow roads and houses stacked close together.
Nissen said firefighters reduce the risks by inspecting lots every year to make sure they're not overgrown. On that front, Harbison Canyon's residents don't seem to need too much prodding, judging from the roar of chain saws and weed trimmers echoing through the canyon on a recent spring weekday afternoon.
