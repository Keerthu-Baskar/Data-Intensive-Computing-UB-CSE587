STOCKHOLM — With 30,000 tickets sold for their friendly against Germany in Stockholm on Saturday, Sweden's female players have called for unity to tackle inequalities between men and women in soccer, especially when it comes to money.
Huge crowds have attended women's games in England, Italy and Spain recently and defender Nilla Fischer told Reuters that fans, players, sponsors and governing bodies would all have to work together to ensure better pay for female players.
""I know that if I'd played in the (German men's) Bundesliga for six years, I wouldn't have any financial worries,"" Fischer said at the team hotel in Stockholm.
""In terms of percentages, you can't really compare. What they maybe make in an hour, I make in a year,"" the 34-year-old VfL Wolfsburg player added.
The comments come after the U.S. women's team, the world champions, launched a lawsuit against their own federation last month alleging gender discrimination, which includes complaints about wages.
Goalkeeper Hedvig Lindahl, who plays for English club Chelsea, said players campaigning for equality in the women's game would continue to do so once they've hung up their boots.
""When we one day quit, we will fill places in these (soccer) organizations and keep the fight going forward. I do think it needs to be a kind of a public pressure, that we don't accept the way it is now,"" Lindahl told Reuters after a training session at the Friends Arena.
""I do however see the difficulties with these big organizations, FIFA especially, because it's their members that vote. I think we have to tackle big issues on the world stage in order for it to really change,"" she added.
Fischer, who gave a fiery speech on the issue when receiving the Diamond Ball as Sweden's best female player in 2018, added that everyone in the game has a role to play.
""I think it's about the whole - I don't think it's about one organization or one clique or one part that is responsible,"" she said.
Sweden are one of the 24 teams set to compete at the Women's World Cup in France from June 7-July 7.

RIO DE JANEIRO — Even in death the haggling went on.
Christian Esmério was going to be the one — his family had been sure of it.
He was 15 and towering, a soccer player with an easy smile that belied his prowess between the goal posts. Already there was talk of contracts, and of buying a home for his parents, who had poured all their savings into the dream that their son might be the next great Brazilian soccer export — the next Ronaldo, Ronaldinho or Neymar.
Now, his father stood in a daze of grief outside a Rio office building, surrounded by lawyers. Just days earlier, Christian had burned to death in
a fire
at the youth academy of one of South America’s most famous soccer clubs, Flamengo. He was one of 10 players killed.
The deaths lifted the veil over international soccer’s biggest production line, and raised sweeping questions about a brutal apparatus that chews up untold numbers of young Brazilian boys for every star it mints.
But for the moment, as lawyers sparred over how much money families of the players killed in the blaze should get, there was just one simple question: What was Christian worth?
“Dreams.”
The word hung in the air as Rafael Stival let out a sigh.
Mr. Stival’s for-profit talent scouting operation had posted a note on Facebook mourning three of its graduates who had died in the fire at Flamengo. Since then, the messages had been pouring in.
They were not condolences. The Facebook post had inadvertently acted as an advertisement — a signal to ambitious parents that Mr. Stival’s organization could get their boys into not just any club, but the great Flamengo. They wanted Mr. Stival to give their boys a chance.
The soccer world in Brazil is populated by a variety of actors, some drawn by glory, but almost all attracted by the chance of breaking out of poverty, maybe even striking it rich.
There are the boys, of course, and their families. There are the investors and the middlemen like Mr. Stival, who trawl the continent-size country in search of prospects as young as 9. And there are the teams, many in a state of such financial disarray that only the sale of the latest star keeps them afloat.
The profits from investing wisely, and early, in even a single player can run into the tens of millions of dollars.
To many in the game, the industry has grown out of control. It has morphed from a system intended to develop promising players into an international market whose value is $7 billion a year, according to soccer’s global governing body, FIFA. In this speculative environment, talented young athletes — some of them children — are bought and sold like any other raw material. In Brazil, the best ones are even referred to that way: as “gems.”
No one knows for sure how many boys are in Brazil’s youth soccer system.
There are no official figures. Estimates range from 12,000 to 15,000, but that is hard to corroborate. The Brazilian soccer federation makes no effort to track players until they turn 16 and become professionals.
But one thing is known: On the night of the Flamengo fire, Feb. 8, more than two dozen boys — most from poor families, and all hoping to achieve a dream — were asleep in a club dormitory.
In a country obsessed with soccer, Flamengo prides itself on being the most popular team, with wealth that is the envy of rivals across South America. But that adoration and power, it appears, may have allowed Flamengo to escape for years any real censure for the treatment of boys in its care.
In 2015, Rio state prosecutors sued Flamengo over the conditions at its training center. The prosecutors cited child-protection failures, declaring the conditions to be “even worse than those currently offered to juvenile delinquents.”
City officials issued an order closing the facility in 2017, but never carried it out, limiting their sanctions to dozens of fines.
In recent years, Flamengo spent millions to upgrade its youth academy. Last year, club officials boasted that the new facilities would be the best in Brazil.
But the dormitory holding 26 sleeping boys on the night of the fire was a makeshift structure, consisting of six steel containers fused together. It had never been inspected, according to local authorities.
Interviews with survivors of the fire and officials who investigated it suggest that a series of failures may have contributed to the boys’ deaths:
— Federal regulations require at least one caretaker for every 10 boys, but there was no adult present at the time of the fire.
— Survivors said the only exit from the dorm was at its far end. Some of the boys may have been in beds farther away from the exit than the 33-feet limit required by the regulations.
— The rooms had sliding doors, another violation because they can jam.
— And while each room had a window, the openings were covered with grates.
One boy who was in Christian’s room told investigators their door had stuck when he tried to get out. The boy managed to slide through the window grates. But Christian, a strapping 6-foot-3 goalkeeper, could not. When rescuers got to him, his body was so badly charred he could be identified only through dental records.
Flamengo officials did not respond to interview requests. But in February, its president, Rodolfo Landim, denied knowing about any irregularities when he spoke at a news conference after the fire.
“Our goal is to solve this problem as quickly as possible,” he said.
Soccer is hardly the only industry to attract Brazil’s desperate.
Sergio Rangel, a journalist who has covered the sport for three decades, says the youth-training system reminds him of the giant gold mine in
Serra Pelada
. The horrific conditions there were immortalized by the photographer Sebastião Salgado in the 1980s.
Desperately poor men from all over the country swarmed the mine’s open pit, turning over rocks in the hope of finding the nugget that would change their lives.
Soccer has also been a fool’s gold of sorts for many families. Some of them move hundreds, even thousands of miles to enroll their sons in training programs that will sort, scrutinize and, more often than not, reject their child as worthless.
“Pick one up, turn it over, and throw it away if it’s no good,” Mr. Rangel said.
The young men are not just disposable. To those who run the industry, they are often indistinguishable.
That much was clear at a memorial for the 10 players who died at Flamengo. Midway through the service, a team official rushed to cover a large montage of photos of the boys: someone had realized that a player who survived had been mistakenly included.
The streets of Xerém, about 50 kilometers outside Rio, teem with boys of various ages in red, green and white jerseys — the colors of the Fluminense soccer club.
Until the team built its training complex there, Xerém was little more than a swamp, locals say. But now, despite the humid heat that tops 100 degrees Fahrenheit, it is home to players and families whose lives revolve around the club.
Among them earlier this year was an 11-year-old nicknamed Maradoninha, for his resemblance to the former Argentine great Diego Maradona. Even in this hotly competitive town, Maradoninha was attracting attention.
Two years ago, a talent scout from Fluminense saw the boy, whose real name is Leandro Gomes Feitosa, play in a local tournament and approached his family. The boy was only 9, and Brazilian law does not allow soccer clubs to house children under 14. But if the family could get to Rio, the scout said, Fluminense would train him.
A group of local businessmen put up the money — for a cut of future proceeds — and the family moved more than 1,200 miles, from the town of Palmas to Xerém, to pursue the dream.
Almost all the families living in their community of 26 rowhouses have a similar story, Maradoninha’s father, Evandro Feitosa, said.
Maradoninha may not be old enough for high school, but he knows his family’s future is tied to his skills with a soccer ball. “God willing,” he said, “I’ll become a big player to help my family in Palmas, my family here and those in need.”
The chances of making it are slim. Fewer than 5 percent of the soccer prospects in Brazil
will ever make it as professionals, by most estimates. Fewer still will earn a decent wage in the game. A study published by the Brazilian soccer federation in 2016 found that 82 percent of soccer players in the country earned less than 1,000 reais ($265) each month.
And for Maradoninha and his family, the odds recently got even slimmer: Fluminense released him.
Whatever the odds, whatever the hardship, there are enough soccer success stories to feed the hopes of young boys and families who have little else to aspire to.
There is Neymar, so successful he is more international brand than player. He is the product of a humble neighborhood on the outskirts of São Paulo. There are Rivaldo, Ronaldo and Romário, three former Brazilian World Cup winners, all awarded the title of best player in the world in their time by FIFA.
And most recently, there is Vinicius Junior, a flashy forward who rose out of Flamengo’s youth ranks. He once trained on the same fields as the 10 boys killed in the fire, and then he began living the dream: in 2017, when he was 16, Spain’s Real Madrid agreed to pay 45 million euros (just over $50 million) for his rights after he played just 11 minutes in his debut game.
All of those players, and hundreds more, have emerged from the Brazil’s soccer mill to ply their trade on the world’s biggest stages.
In his early days in the sport, Christian’s parents used all they had — and borrowed from friends and neighbors — to finance his soccer dream.
He seemed to be getting closer to his own version of the soccer success story. On March 5, the day he turned 16, he was expected to sign his first professional contract at Flamengo. His dream, years in the making, was in reach.
He died four weeks before that birthday.
Days after his death, his father, Cristiano Esmério, was standing outside an office tower in downtown Rio where public defenders were meeting with officials from Flamengo. He was with a group of lawyers. One turned to him.
When it came to compensation, the lawyer said, it would be unfair if Christian's family was treated the same as the others. After all, he said, some of the dead boys had been recent arrivals to the club. But Christian was different: He had been called up to one of Brazil’s youth national teams. Clearly he was worth more than the rest.
Esmério nodded silently. He and his son had discussed money, too.
“Dad, let’s look for a house,” he recalls Christian saying when he got word that he was closing in on a professional contract. “My first paycheck, I want to pay for a house for my mom, so she doesn’t have to suffer because she doesn’t have water or electricity.”
A week before he died, the boy posted a tribute to his family on Facebook. Above two pictures of father and son taken a decade apart, he made a promise:
“All the sacrifice will be compensated, my old man.”

(Reuters) - Argentina's national soccer coach Lionel Scaloni has been released from hospital in Mallorca after being hit by a car while riding his bicycle, the Argentine football association said on Tuesday.
""The Argentina coach, Lionel Scaloni, suffered an accident today while cycling. He is now on his way home after being discharged from hospital,"" the team's Twitter account said.
Spanish newspaper El Mundo said earlier on Tuesday that Scaloni, who was named Argentina's permanent coach in November, was taken to the Hospital Universitario Son Espases on the Spanish island with multiple injuries.
Scaloni later posted a picture of himself on his official Twitter account sporting tape above and below his bruised left eye and on his nose and forehead, with the words: ""Many thanks for the messages, a few stitches and now I'm off back home.""
Scaloni will oversee the team's Copa America campaign this year, with Argentina bidding to win their first major trophy since 1993.
The 40-year-old made seven appearances for his country as a defender and had a long, varied career which began at Newell's Old Boys, in Rosario in central Argentina.
His longest spell at one club came at Deportivo La Coruna, where he won the La Liga title in 2000, while he also played for Racing Santander and Mallorca in Spain plus West Ham United and Lazio and Atalanta, retiring from playing in 2015.
He became assistant to Jorge Sampaoli at La Liga outfit Sevilla in 2016 and followed him when he became coach of Argentina in 2017.
Sampaoli was sacked in the wake of the side's disastrous 2018 World Cup campaign and their last-16 defeat to France, but Scaloni stayed on as caretaker coach before being handed the job on a permanent basis in November.

(Reuters) - Chelsea midfielder Danny Drinkwater has no future at the Premier League club because he is not suited to their style of play, manager Maurizio Sarri said on Wednesday.
Drinkwater joined Chelsea from Leicester City for a reported 35 million pounds in 2017 but last played for the London club in the Community Shield in August.
The midfielder was charged with drink driving earlier this week and was left out of Chelsea's squad for their trip to face Slavia Prague in the Europa League quarter-finals later on Thursday.
""(Drinkwater) has never played because... he's not suitable to my system, to my way of playing,"" Sarri told reporters.
""Maybe I'm wrong, but it's my opinion. I spoke with him in August, when the market was still open, and said he should look for something different because he wouldn't play. And I told him the reasons, my reasons.
""I don't know (why he decided to stay). Probably he hoped we could change the system. I have a very good relationship with him because, in my opinion, he's a good boy... but he's not suitable for me.""
Sarri plans to make five or six changes for the Europa League match and says his side will need to be on their toes to get a result.
""In my opinion, this is a very dangerous match for us,"" he added. Slavia are a fast team, so we need to be very, very compact and defend really very well.
""They are dangerous, especially on crosses where they attack the box with five or six players, and are dangerous on counter-attacks. So it won't be easy for us.""

Alex Morgan scored her 100th international goal and substitute Mallory Pugh scored twice when the U.S. Women's National Team rallied to defeat Australia 5-3 in a friendly at Dick's Sporting Goods Park in Commerce City, Colo., on Thursday.
Megan Rapinoe broke a 2-2 tie in the 61st minute with a strike from 22 yards out for her 44th goal. Pugh, from Highland Ranch, Colo., replaced Rapinoe and her first touch extended the lead to 4-2 in the 67th minute with Emily Sonnett earning her second assist.
Samantha Kerr's header pulled Australia to a 4-3 deficit in the 81st minute but Pugh chipped in the insurance goal in the fifth minute of stoppage time.
Morgan opened the scoring in the 14th minute to become the 17th woman to reach the century mark. She is tied for sixth on the all-time U.S. list with Tiffeny Milbrett and has 27 goals in her past 32 matches.
She has scored in 70 of her 159 games, with the U.S. going 60-0-10.
Morgan controlled an overhead ball by bodying defender Clare Polkinghorne. She dribbled the left flank toward the top of the penalty area before making a cutback on defender Alanna Kennedy to create space for the shot from 16 yards that went into the far netting.
Lisa De Vanna made it 1-1 in the 29th minute from the left side following a layoff by Caitlin Foord.
The U.S responded but couldn't break the deadlock. Ellie Carpenter cleared a shot by Rapinoe in the 32nd minute; goalkeeper Lydia Williams denied Colorado native Lindsey Horan in the 34th and Rose Lavelle a minute later.
Foord gave Australia a 2-1 lead in the 47th minute, but the U.S. got the equalizer six minutes later with Tobin Heath's header.
The U.S. has three more friendlies before the start of the 2019 Women's World Cup in France in June, beginning with Belgium on Sunday at Banc of California Stadium in Los Angeles.

LOS ANGELES — The United States women's national team pumped in four first half goals en route to a 6-0 romp against Belgium in a one-sided friendly as the reigning World Cup champions continue to build momentum ahead of their title defense in France in June.
Carli Lloyd opened their account with a leaping header off a long pass from Tierna Davidson that found the bottom corner of the goal in the 14th minute.
Five minutes later, the veteran midfielder unleashed another header to a nearly identical spot in the net to send the nearly 21,000 fans at the Banc of California Stadium in Los Angeles into a frenzy on a warm Southern California night.
""I know who I am. I know what I'm capable of,"" Lloyd, who was making her first start this year, told reporters after the match.
Forward Lindsey Horan nodded in a goal off a corner kick past diving Belgian goalkeeper Nicky Evrard in the 26th minute and midfielder Samantha Mewis effectively put the game out of Belgium's reach with a header to put the hosts 4-0 ahead.
Forward Alex Morgan came on as a substitute to start the second half and scored two minutes later when she broke free of her defender, took a pass from Lloyd, and chipped a shot over Evrard's head for her 101st career goal.
Forward Jessica McDonald completed the rout with a header off a set-piece move in the 90th minute as the team improved to 4-1-2 in 2019.
The match was the last for the U.S. before the team selects its World Cup roster, which will look to bring the team home its fourth title.

(Reuters) - Forward Alex Morgan reached a personal milestone with her 100th international goal as the United States beat Australia 5-3 in a friendly in Colorado on Thursday.
In opening the scoring in the 15th minute with a superb solo run capped by a precise finish, Morgan became the seventh American woman -- 17th from any country -- to reach the century mark.
It was far from smooth sailing for the reigning World Cup champions, who fell behind Australia early in the second half in front of a sellout crowd in suburban Denver.
The home team, however, scored three times in 14 minutes to regain the lead for good in an entertaining encounter between two of the favorites heading into World Cup in France in June.
Local favorite Mallory Pugh made it 4-2 by scoring less than a minute after coming on, before adding a second with a deft dink over the keeper in the final minute of stoppage time to seal the result.
Earlier, Australia equalized on the half hour when pacy veteran winger Lisa De Vanna fired home.
Caitlin Foord gave Australia the lead early in the second half, before Tobin Heath and Megan Rapinoe put the U.S. ahead again.
Samantha Kerr scored with a thumping header in the 82nd minute to give Australia some hope, but the visitors could not find an equalizer.
""We can't let that many goals in ... but they're a great attacking team so you've got to give them credit,"" said veteran Rapinoe after her 150th appearance for the U.S.
The Americans continue their World Cup preparation with another friendly against Belgium in California on Sunday.

BARCELONA — Barcelona closed in on the La Liga title after beating 10-man Atletico Madrid 2-0 in Saturday's top-of-the-table showdown at the Nou Camp as late strikes by Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi gave the Catalans an 11-point lead at the top of the table.
Atletico began brightly but their gameplan went out of the window when Diego Costa was shown a straight red card in the 28th minute for a verbal tirade at referee Jesus Gil Manzano.
Atletico produced a gutsy second-half display, expertly shackling Barca, but the Catalans finally found a way past the visitors' outstanding goalkeeper Jan Oblak with a superb curling shot from Suarez in the 85th minute.
Moments later Messi sealed victory and quite probably the league title with an irresistibly cool finish into the net and Barca's fans jubilantly chanted ""champions"", crowing at their surely unassailable lead at the top with seven games remaining.
Atletico midfielder Koke conceded that Barca had wrapped up the title but questioned the decision to send Costa off.
""Barca are practically champions. It was a very strange game, we were doing so well until the red card but all the small details went their way,"" Koke told reporters.
""Whenever we come here something strange happens, we've had a lot of red cards against Barca and not all of them have been fair. When you have 10 men against one of the best teams in the world it's normal that it's a struggle.""
Suarez highlighted his side's character for winning such a difficult game so soon after their gruelling 4-4 draw against Villarreal in midweek.
""This was another game which shows just how hard it is to win the league so we deserve lot more credit for what we're achieving,"" Suarez said.
""We've now got a very big advantage over Atletico. There are still some games left but we took two steps towards winning the league today.""
MAD MOMENT
Atletico realistically needed to win at the Nou Camp for the first time since 2006 to stay in the title race and they played with ambition and intelligence in the opening stages, keeping the ball for long periods and depriving Barca of space.
But they were rocked by Costa's moment of madness which killed their early momentum and left them with little choice but to defend for the remaining hour of the game.
Striker Costa reacted angrily to not being awarded a foul after being tackled by Jordi Alba and gave a long verbal response to the referee, who to his disbelief pulled out a red card.
Costa had to be shepherded off the pitch by Barca's Gerard Pique as he struggled to control his temper while his team mates Diego Godin and Jose Gimenez earned bookings for venting their anger over the decision.
Atletico coped superbly with the setback and numerical disadvantage, controlling the space for the majority of the game.
Messi still carved his way through the middle of the pitch on two occasions, creating openings for Suarez and himself but both South American forwards were thwarted by the titanic presence of Oblak.
Atletico naturally had limited opportunities down the other end but were not far from finding a goal when Antoine Griezmann picked out Rodrigo from a free kick but the midfielder headed over the bar when Gimenez was stood behind him, in a better position.
Diego Simeone's side could not last the distance, however, and as their legs inevitably tired, Barca's attacking quality made the difference.
""We knew what the game would be like, Atletico are very organised and after the red card we tried to attack more but it wasn't easy,"" Suarez said.
""But we kept going, we showed a great attitude and kept testing their goalkeeper who was the hero of the game.""

LONDON — Two English second-tier clubs have condemned racist abuse of players following Saturday's games.
Brentford said it ""utterly condemns discrimination"" after a season-ticket holder was arrested following an allegation of abuse by Derby midfielder Duane Holmes.
The incident happened late in the League Championship match after Holmes was substituted in the 74th minute. The game at Griffin Park in west London ended 3-3.
Derby manager Frank Lampard says ""Duane's upset with the situation. It's not what we want to see in life, not just in football.""
In a separate case, Wigan reported a racist message sent to defender Nathan Byrne on Twitter to the police and said ""we find this behavior abhorrent.""
Byrne posted a screenshot on his Twitter account of a message he received following Wigan's 2-2 draw with Bristol City at Ashton Gate.
Anti-racism group Kick It Out says it will be ""liaising with the relevant authorities and offering support to clubs and players involved.""

EDINBURGH, Scotland — A coconut was thrown on the pitch during the Edinburgh derby between Hearts and Hibernian on Saturday.
It was hurled onto the grass from the away end at sixth-place Hearts just after Hibernian winger Daryl Horgan's 28th-minute goal had cancelled out Peter Haring's header three minutes earlier.
Maroon and green smoke bombs were also thrown on the field before and during the first half of the Scottish Premiership game. Horgan scored again in the second half to give fifth-place Hibernian a 2-1 victory.
""It is the first time I have ever heard of a coconut being thrown on,"" Hearts manager Craig Levein said. ""Who has got a spare coconut to throw on? Honestly, it is mental.""

LOS ANGELES — When the members of the United States women’s national team negotiated their current collective bargaining agreement with U.S. Soccer in 2017, they secured what seemed to be a significant victory on match bonuses.
In addition to seeing those bonuses increase as much as sixfold for winning certain games, the players no longer needed to win to collect extra pay. For the first time, they would also earn bonuses even if they tied matches against top-tier opponents.
The compromise — ceding some guaranteed compensation from salaries in exchange for higher performance bonuses — helped break a deadlock in negotiations amid a broader fight over pay equity and working conditions, a battle that recently
moved to federal court
. But the players also decided the arrangement was a calculated risk worth taking: Playing for one of the world’s best teams, they view every game as winnable. And with each victory set to be worth as much as $8,500 per player, the bonuses brought the potential for tens of thousands of dollars in extra income.
Yet two years after striking their deal, the players are coping with the reality that winning isn’t always entirely within their control. Experiments with roster selections, starting lineups, tactical formations and even substitutions by Coach Jill Ellis — all within her purview and part of the normal evaluation period between major championships — have led to uneven performances and to frustration within a team that now has large payouts on the line every time it takes the field.
During the two years since the new C.B.A. took effect, in fact, the team has missed out on roughly $1.7 million in performance bonuses — sometimes as much as $200,000 for a single match. For some players, that is as much as $74,250 each. The analysis of bonus pay is based on figures
contained in the team’s C.B.A.
, which has not been released publicly.
“We have a very bonus-heavy structure, purposefully — we win a lot of games and expect that we’ll win a lot of games,” forward Megan Rapinoe said. “That is part of the balance, understanding that we have a lot of money tied to wins and especially wins against top teams.”
The payments, which for the first time are based on the quality of a given opponent, are worth a maximum of $8,500 per player for a win against the four top-ranked teams in the world, plus Canada, and up to $1,750 for a draw. Against a tier of opponents ranked Nos. 5 through 8, wins are worth $6,500 and draws $1,250. If the Americans beat a team in the lowest bonus tier, like
Sunday’s 6-0 thrashing of Belgium
, each player on the roster earns a bonus of $5,250.
Lose, though, for any reason, and the players on U.S. Soccer contracts get no bonus at all.
Asked about how experimentation may cost the team short-term results — and thus, bonuses — Ellis said her priority has been looking long term and leaving no stone unturned before the World Cup.
“You want to win,” Ellis said, “but I’d rather get every box checked.”
It is also worth noting that the team isn’t losing more than it has historically; from the end of 2017 to the start of 2019, the United States even went on a 28-game unbeaten streak. But with each result now carrying a higher price tag for each player, the unpredictability created by abrupt experiments by Ellis has been unsettling to some in the locker room.
Ellis’s experiments have varied, including using three-back systems that featured a midfielder, Allie Long, as a center back, or others that pushed wing Mallory Pugh into a central midfield role for the first time against several of the world’s top teams. Once, Ellis asked Crystal Dunn to play three positions in a single match.
When there was a reprieve from such tests during the team’s World Cup qualifying tournament last year — Ellis kept her approach simple as the United States bulldozed through the event — the players noticed.
“You’ve seen a lot more consistency in the lineups and within the roster, so we’re seeing more consistency on the field and on the score sheets,” Alex Morgan said at the time.
But once the Americans clinched their spot in France, the tinkering resumed, and it has continued, even as the World Cup nears.
“Sometimes it’s O.K. to sacrifice results in terms of performance to get the best out of the team and figure out what that is,” Rapinoe said last week, “but we’re probably past that point — or we should be.”
The players were aware of the potential downside of their new C.B.A. even before they ratified it two years ago: A month before the players approved the deal, which retroactively covered all results in early 2017, they had been trounced at
a new tournament
, the SheBelieves Cup, while struggling to adapt to a new tactical system.
The team lost the SheBelieves Cup again this year when continued tinkering by Ellis resulted in draws against Japan and England. Because the tournament also offers a $5,000 bonus per player for a first-place finish — another carrot in the new C.B.A. — the team missed out on a total of nearly $400,000 in combined bonuses over a single two-week period.
“The paycheck was a little light last month, that’s for sure,” Rapinoe joked last week. “Unfortunately.”
Those paychecks, though, represent the optimistic stance the team took in its C.B.A. negotiations in 2017. With U.S. Soccer
unwilling to increase guaranteed salaries
, the team sought other ways to increase its compensation and maximize the upside of future success. Unlike their men’s counterparts, however, the women’s players
do not have large club salaries
to fall back on if they get injured,
fall out of favor
or — in a worst-case scenario —
miss out on the biggest bonuses
by failing to qualify for the World Cup.
That made the women’s new C.B.A. a stark departure for a team that had
prioritized the stability of guaranteed pay
. But it also means that a single poor performance now stings far more than it used to, even if it helps Ellis collect valuable insight.
Ultimately, though, the prize that matters most to the players is winning the World Cup. If they successfully defend their world title this summer, all the dropped results and experimenting will have been worth it.
“If we just breeze through and beat every team, 2-0 or 3-0, we’re not going to learn anything,” defender Becky Sauerbrunn said. “It’s good to get players who don’t have a lot of experience playing time. It’s good to play different formations and see if it works, or not, against the top teams in the world.
“I see a lot of value in the losses, the wins and the ties.”

PARIS — Brazilian soccer legend Pele was discharged from a French hospital on Monday after recovering from a urinary infection, media in France reported.
Pele, 78, was admitted to the hospital in Paris last Wednesday with a strong fever, after attending an event in the city with France's World Cup-winning player Kylian Mbappe.
Pele, considered by many as soccer's best-ever player and the winner of three World Cups with the Brazilian national team, was treated with antibiotics and said on Friday he was feeling much better.
There was no immediate confirmation of the discharge from Pele's press office in Brazil.

LONDON — Pep Guardiola clasped his hands to his head, a look of sheer exasperation on his face. Even that, though, did not feel sufficient, not after one of his players had given the ball away so carelessly. And so the Manchester City manager hurled himself to the ground, curled over in his cable-knit sweater, and beat the turf with his fists.
By the time he had picked himself up, the danger had passed, but that was not the point. Guardiola seeks perfection; there are times when he takes anything less as a personal slight. He frantically waved to the culprit, Ilkay Gündogan, to grab his attention. In the tumult of the
Tottenham Hotspur Stadium
on Tuesday, he had to resort to mime.
Two hands, palms flat, raised: What, exactly, was that?
Two fingers, pointed to the temples: Think.
Watching Guardiola on the touchline is exhausting. Few managers seem to become so absorbed in a game, so consumed by it. He moves constantly, restlessly — pacing and jittering and signaling, bellowing instructions and calling players over for brief conclaves and turning on his heel to consult with his bench.
After a while, once the movements are decoded, it is almost possible to tell how Manchester City is playing simply by watching Guardiola, a cross between a telegraph service and an interpretive dance troupe.
Even at the best of times — which, given City’s success, is most of the time — he seems frazzled, but when things are not going well, when his lofty standards are not being met, everything speeds up. More players are beckoned over, more impromptu huddles are held, more ground is covered. His stress is almost palpable.
Tuesday night was one of those times. Manchester City was not even losing when Gündogan drew his ire: It would be another few minutes before Son Heung-min delivered the goal that gave Tottenham a 1-0 advantage heading into next week’s second leg of this Champions League quarterfinal. At the time, indeed, City was ascendant, slowly asserting itself, drawing the sting from Spurs, quelling the noise from the crowd, starting to create chances.
And yet, even then, this was not the imperious City that has won 22 of its last 23 games, including 14 straight. It was not the fine-tuned team that is on course to win 98 points in the Premier League, after hitting an unprecedented 100 last year, or the one that had been hailed by Mauricio Pochettino, the Spurs coach, as arguably the best team in Europe.
The mood had been set in the first few seconds, as Tottenham’s Harry Kane charged down Nicolás Otamendi, blocking his attempted clearance, sending the ball arcing into the sky, inciting the 60,000 or so packed into Spurs’ box-fresh new home. From that point on, City did not have a moment to settle, to find its rhythm, to start weaving its hypnotizing patterns.
Still, Guardiola’s team might have led — such is City’s quality that it does not need to play at its best, or even especially well, to create chances — had Sergio Agüero converted an early penalty, awarded for a handball by Danny Rose that none of the players, fans, coaches or officials in the stadium seemed to spot. (Rose did, admittedly, look a little sheepish.)
The Video Assistant Referee had seen it, though: Bjorn Kuipers, his counterpart on the turf, duly checked and pointed to the spot, for reasons that would not have been clear to anyone not watching on a television.
Perhaps the sight of Hugo Lloris diving to his left and palming Agüero’s shot away was what strained Guardiola’s nerves. Perhaps, at that point, a sense of foreboding descended upon him.
There is a curiosity in Guardiola’s gilded record as a coach. He is, of course, the most successful manager of his generation. He has won titles in Spain, Germany and England; he has won the Champions League twice; he has, more than once, changed the soccer culture of not just a club but a country. He has improved dozens of players, many who might have reasonably expected that they could not be improved. He is, in 99 ways out of 100, beyond reproach.
He struggles, though, when it comes to traveling away from home for Champions League knockout games. Over the course of his career, the decade or so in which he has become the gold standard for coaching, he has played 26 such fixtures. He has won just six of them. This defeat — whether City can turn it around in Manchester next week or not — means he has now drawn 10 and lost 10.
Given the resources Guardiola has had at his disposal in that span — the Barcelona of Messi, Xavi, and Andrés Iniesta; a Bayern Munich that dominated the Bundesliga; this Manchester City team that is so untouchable in English domestic competition — that record is unsatisfactory.
Increasingly, in these fixtures, he has the air of a man not quite sure what to do, someone who does not — in this one specific context — trust his usual, impeccable instincts.
At Liverpool last year
, he chose to flood the midfield, omitting Raheem Sterling in favor of the more conservative Gündogan. Liverpool swept his team aside, leaving City too much to do to recover at home.
Here, too, he tweaked the formula that had worked so well the rest of the year. Among a raft of changes, Gündogan started again, alongside Fernandinho. More unexpected still was the presence of the combative Fabian Delph and the enigmatic Riyad Mahrez. It was not until the final two minutes that Kevin De Bruyne and Leroy Sané, his two most destructive options on the bench, made an appearance.
There were mitigating circumstances, of course. City has a hectic April, a Premier League title to win and a squad to keep fresh. But whatever the reasons, the outcome was the same. City stalled — not by much, but by enough. Once again, on the road in Europe — or at least as much as Britain is in Europe these days — Guardiola tried to solve a problem that did not exist, and caught himself out.
The damage need not be fatal, of course. City will still believe it can overturn this deficit on home turf next week, especially with Kane now likely to be sidelined with an ankle injury for the rest of the season. It will be tight, though, tense and nervous and strained, the sort of night when what happens in the technical area will tell you what happens on the field.

The lone remaining Major League Soccer team in the CONCACAF Champions League would need a major comeback to reach the finals.
Monterrey routed Sporting Kansas City 5-0 on Thursday in Guadalupe, Mexico, in the first leg of a total-goals semifinal series. The return leg will be played April 11 at Kansas City, Kan.
Dorlan Pabon and Aviles Hurtado scored in the seventh and 14th minutes respectively to give Monterrey a fast start. The game was secured when Jesus Gallardo scored in the 55th minute, Nicolas Sanchez converted a penalty kick in the 70th minute, and Pabon found the net again in the 76th minute.
In the first semifinal matchup Wednesday, host Tigres routed Santos Laguna 3-0 in an all-Liga MX matchup at San Nicolas de los Garza, Mexico. The second leg of that series will be played next Wednesday at Torreon, Mexico.
The two-legged final will be held in late April and early May.
No MLS team has won the competition since the Los Angeles Galaxy were champions in 2000. Mexican clubs have won every title since 2006.

(Reuters) - Wayne Rooney was sent off for the first time in Major League Soccer after the DC United forward made a poorly-timed lunging tackle on Los Angeles FC striker Diego Rossi on Saturday.
Rooney, in his second season with DC United, lost control of the ball and lunged with both feet off the ground just as Rossi took a touch. Rooney's studs landed hard on Rossi's leg, just below the knee, scything down the Uruguayan.
The referee initially produced a yellow card but following a check with the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) he changed his decision and showed the former England international a straight red card.
""I have no arguments,"" Rooney, who is England's all-time leading scorer, told reporters. ""It wasn't malicious, I didn't try to hurt him.
""But obviously I caught him. I was expecting (a red card) really when the referee gave me the yellow. It's the right call.""
It was Rooney's first red card since 2014 and the seventh of his career for club and country. DC United, who were losing 3-0 at the time, lost 4-0 as Rossi completed a hat-trick.

(Reuters) - Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has urged Tottenham Hotspur full back Danny Rose not to let racism win by following through on his plan to walk away from football when his playing career ends.
England international Rose said on Thursday that he could not wait to leave football because he had had enough of the racism in the game and was frustrated by the response of the authorities to the abuse.
Rose was among several English players who were victims of offensive chanting in a Euro 2020 qualifier in Montenegro last month.
Guardiola, whose City team play Tottenham in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday, said Rose should stay in football and continue to fight racism from within the game.
""The best way to fight and combat this kind of terrible situation is fighting and being there every day - and of course (Rose) is an extraordinary footballer,"" Guardiola told a news conference on Friday.
""I will tell him when I see him next Tuesday.""
The chanting in Montenegro gave fresh impetus to the debate over whether the game's authorities are doing enough to tackle racism in soccer.
UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said this month that referees should stop matches when players have been subjected to racial abuse, while Rose's England team mate Raheem Sterling called for stiffer sanctions for fans who racially abuse players.

ZURICH — AC Milan have been reported by UEFA investigators over an alleged new breach of European soccer's break-even rule known as Financial Fair Play (FFP), the governing body said on Wednesday.
UEFA said the investigation found that Milan had ""failed to comply with the break-even requirement"" for the 2018/19 season, its most recent monitoring period, and that the case had been passed to its financial adjudicators.
There was no immediate comment from the Serie A club.
Under UEFA regulations, any club spending more than the revenue it generates faces possible sanctions, including, in certain circumstances, a ban from competitions run by UEFA.
UEFA said that the referral was not connected to the previous case against the seven-times European champions which saw them banned and then reprieved on appeal.
Milan were given a one-season ban from European football in June after UEFA ruled that the club had not complied with FFP rules for the previous monitoring period.
Milan appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) which overturned the ban in July, accepting the club’s argument that its finances had improved after an ownership change.
Milan were then able to take part in this season's Europa League, which they exited in the group stage, while UEFA was ordered by CAS to find an alternative punishment.
In its revised decision in December, UEFA gave Milan until June 2021 to comply with the rules or face a one-season ban from European competition.
Milan are currently fourth in Serie A, which is the final Champions League qualifying place for next season's competition.

MADRID — The Spanish soccer federation (RFEF) said on Tuesday it will organise a revamped Super Cup to take place outside of Spain from next January and revealed sweeping changes to the Copa del Rey which is set to reduce fixture congestion.
""The president of the RFEF, Luis Rubiales, told members at a board meeting today about the project we are working on to redesign the current formats of the Spanish Super Cup and the Copa del Rey,"" said a statement on the federation's website.
""With regards to the Super Cup, the RFEF will develop a 'Final Four' format for the tournament to take place outside of Spain in the month of January.
""The Copa del Rey will switch formats to single-game ties played at the ground of the weaker team until the semi-final stages.""
In February, Rubiales revealed plans to shake up the Super Cup, the season curtain raiser which pits the winners of La Liga against the Copa del Rey holders and is usually held over two legs, saying that the new-look event would take place in August.
The shifting of the tournament to January comes after the initial plans were criticised by La Liga's organising body due to the potential for a scheduling conflict with the start of the new season.
Rubiales broke with tradition last year by turning the Super Cup into a single game played in Tangier, Morocco, where Barcelona beat Sevilla 2-1.
He opposes La Liga’s plans to play Spanish top flight games abroad and his organisation blocked a proposal to move last January's game between Girona and Barcelona to Miami.
The RFEF has not yet revealed which country the revamped Super Cup will take place in.
The RFEF added that teams competing in the Super Cup will earn a bye to the last 32 of the Copa del Rey, with each tie apart from the semi-finals being played over one game at the ground of the smallest side.
The plans for both tournaments must be approved by clubs at an extraordinary general assembly taking place on April 29.
In its current format, La Liga sides enter the Copa del Rey in the round of 32, and this season's finalists Barcelona and Valencia had to play eight games to reach the showpiece, clogging their schedules in January and February.

(Reuters) - Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has learnt the subtle art of man-management from former boss Alex Ferguson and the Norwegian said he will not hesitate to plug in the 'hairdryer' to get the best out of his players.
Speaking ahead of Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final first leg against Barcelona, Solskjaer said that working under Ferguson as a player and later as coach ensured he knew when to comfort his players and when to blast them like the fiery Scot.
Ferguson's hairdryer treatment, where he stood nose-to-nose with a player while angrily critiquing their performance, has become part of English soccer folklore.
""Towards the end of my career I was more focused on what the manager said. You learn that there was a pattern to what he was saying,"" Solskjaer told ESPN in an interview.
""He would put his arm around someone or go hard on someone to really get the best out of them. That's what I learned from him the most -- how he managed to get the best out of every single player.
""There's a pattern to how he builds his team up to believe: 'We are going to make this'. I've used some of his team talks. You've got to plan; you can't just act on emotion.""
Under Solskjaer, who was appointed permanent United boss last month following a successful interim spell, the club have returned to a more familiar attacking style which was the hallmark of Ferguson's teams.
The 46-year-old suggested the techniques he learnt from Ferguson had been effective.
""If your kids disappoint you, you have to tell them off. If you can see they're trying their utmost, I don't think there's any reason why you should scream,"" Solskjaer added.
""Sometimes you talk sensibly and sometimes you have to raise your voice. When he (Ferguson) went on one of his hairdryers or when he was hammering people, there was a reason... he was maybe pointing at one player so that the 10 others would help him out.
""Sometimes you've got to go strong. You do it when you're disappointed.""

(Reuters) - Brazil's female footballers have made great strides in growing their domestic game but they lack the organisation to emulate the United States team and demand the same pay and conditions as men, defender Erika told Reuters on Tuesday.
The Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) this year obliged all first division clubs to create a women's side and are funding them directly, officials said.
But their income is still vastly inferior to their male counterparts and Erika said she is envious of the World Cup-winning U.S. squad, 28 of whom sued the U.S. Soccer Federation last month in a lawsuit that includes complaints about wages and working conditions.
""I think it is sensational what the U.S. players did,"" she said in a phone interview from Spain, the day after Brazil lost 1-0 to Scotland in a friendly, their ninth consecutive defeat.
""We have the strength to do the same in Brazil but we don't have courage or the (people) to guide us.
""The U.S. women are a gigantic force. They have won a lot and that makes it easier for them to fight for what they want. We need to be united but we haven't managed that.""
Erika blamed that lack of unity on geography. Most of the Brazilian women play their club football outside the country and get together only for international games, which makes organising more difficult.
""I think distance is a problem,"" the 31-year-old Corinthians defender said. ""The principal players are based outside the country and that makes it more complicated, if they were all able to be here it would make it easier to develop, and we'd be stronger.
""Sadly, we still think individually.""
The Brazilian players nevertheless looked at recent big crowds for women's matches in Spain and Italy – a world record 60,739 people turned out to see Atletico Madrid take on Barcelona last month - as indicative of the growing power of the female game.
Women's football has gained a higher profile this year in Brazil, with the CBF paying to help women's teams compete in the 16-team first division and also setting up a second division and under-18 league.
""Without a doubt here has been a huge growth and there is a long way to go,"" Erika said.
""I want to see the kind of crowds we saw in Madrid in Brazil. It inspires us.""
Brazil are one of 24 teams who will take part in the Women's World Cup in France from June 7-July 7.

BERLIN — Bayern Munich's 5-0 thrashing of Borussia Dortmund in their top-of-the-table clash left the Bavarians one point clear with six games left and a huge psychological advantage.
Here are five talking points from the Bundesliga weekend:
VAR BITES BACK AT SCHALKE
Schalke 04 were given a video assistant referee (VAR) let-off which surprised even themselves but were not so lucky the second time as a stoppage-time penalty handed them a 2-1 home defeat by Eintracht Frankfurt.
Eintracht forward Ante Rebic went down in the area in the first half and, although most observers felt it was a clear penalty, the referee decided otherwise after consulting the pitchside screen.
""VAR doesn't give Frankfurt a penalty. We're not sure why not,"" conceded Schalke's Twitter feed.
But there was a different outcome in stoppage time when Daniel Caligiuri was judged to have handled in the box and Luca Jovic converted to give Eintracht a 2-1 win.
""Caligiuri was pushed, then the ball bounced off his shoulder and against his hand,"" said Schalke coach Huub Stevens.
The defeat left Schalke in 14th, five points clear of VfB Stuttgart who are in the relegation playoff spot. Eintracht, unbeaten since the winter break, are fourth and on course to qualify for the Champions League next season.
JOVIC STEPS UP IN HALLER'S ABSENCE
Eintracht's regular penalty taker Sebastien Haller was missing through injury but, despite never having taken a penalty in the Bundesliga before, 21-year-old Jovic had no hesitation in stepping up to accept the responsibility
The Serb coolly converted for his 17th league goal of the season and made a small slice of history in the process -- officially timed as being scored in the 99th minute, it was the latest-ever penalty in Bundesliga history.
BAYERN COACH SINGLES OUT DORTMUND WEAKNESS
Soccer coaches rarely single out individual weakness in the opposition but Bayern Munich's Nico Kovac broke with convention and pointed the finger at Borussia Dortmund's Dan-Axel Zagadou after their 5-0 win.
Zagadou set up the second goal when his back pass fell to Roberto Lewandowski -- something Kovac said he saw coming.
""We discussed it before the game and we knew that Zagadou was liable to make a mistake,"" said Kovac.
REUS NOT GIVING UP DESPITE BAYERN MAULING
Borussia Dortmund captain Marco Reus refused to throw in the towel after the defeat at Bayern, although he accepted that the Bavarians now hold all the cards.
""Bayern have the clear psychological advantage, but they also have two or three tough games to come,"" he said.
""There's no point in us talking about the title if we play like that again, but there's only one point in it and things can change very quickly in the Bundesliga.
""We have to show a completely different side to ourselves next Saturday. We've fought back before.""
Dortmund may have the slightly easier run-in with games at home to Mainz 05, Schalke 04 and Fortuna Duesseldorf and away to Freiburg, Werder Bremen and Borussia Moenchengladbach.
Bayern's matches include two against teams in the top four -- Eintracht Frankfurt at home and RB Leipzig away. They also host Werder Bremen and Hanover 96 and visit Fortuna Duesseldorf and Nuremberg.
FORTUNA CELEBRATE TENTH PLACE
Favourites for relegation before the season started, promoted Fortuna Duesseldorf are in tenth place after their 2-1 win at Hertha Berlin lifted them above their opponents.
Their huge contingent of travelling fans celebrated as if their team had won the title, as the win effectively sealed Fortuna's Bundesliga status for another season.
""Now, I can say with certainty that we will play in the Bundesliga next season,"" said coach Friedhelm Funkel.

LONDON — The long-running British TV soap ""Coronation Street"" is welcoming its first black family in its 59-year history.
The soap opera is set to introduce the Baileys, a family with two sons. It will explore themes of racism and homophobia in sport, with a story line featuring one of the sons, a soccer player, coming out as gay.
The show has charted the goings-on in the fictional northern England community of Weatherfield since 1960. It has cast individual black characters but not brought in a black family together before.
Producer Iain MacLeod said Saturday he didn't really know why it has taken so long, but it ""did feel sort of overdue we did this and represented modern Manchester a bit more accurately.""

Good morning.
(
Here’s the sign-up
, if you don’t already get California Today by email.)
Although the
California connections
run deep throughout the sprawling college admissions scandal, the complex federal case is now playing out in Boston.
My colleague,
Kate Taylor
, has been covering the court proceedings. Here, she reports on the latest:
In a coup for prosecutors and possible bad news for other defendants in the sweeping college admissions fraud investigation, one of the parents charged in the case, Davina Isackson of Hillsborough, Calif., has agreed to plead guilty and to cooperate with the government, according to a person with knowledge of the case.
Two other parents
have said so far
that they intend to plead guilty, and more will probably follow in the coming days. But Ms. Isackson’s agreement to cooperate is significant. Ms. Isackson and her husband, Bruce, a real estate developer, were accused of conspiring with William Singer, the college consultant at the center of the case, to bribe athletics officials in order to secure their daughters’ admission to U.C.L.A. and U.S.C. as athletic recruits.
Prosecutors also accused them of paying Mr. Singer so that a proctor could correct their younger daughter’s answers on her ACT exam. The prosecutors have said that the Isacksons paid Mr. Singer a total of $600,000.
[
Catch up on all of The Times’s coverage here.
]
Mr. Singer has pleaded guilty to racketeering and other charges.
The agreement to cooperate means that Ms. Isackson will share what she knows about the roles that officials at U.C.L.A. and U.S.C. played in the scheme and, if their cases go to trial, could testify against them. It also puts pressure on other parents charged in the recruitment scheme; if Ms. Isackson testifies that she believes her actions were wrong, it makes it harder for others to say that they thought that they were simply making innocent donations.
One unusual aspect of the Isacksons’ case is that, according to the charging documents, their older daughter, Lauren, who was admitted to U.C.L.A. as a soccer recruit despite not being a top player, was required to participate on the team as a student-athlete for a year. She is
listed on the 2017 roster
as a midfielder. Most students involved in the case did not actually play on the teams they had been recruited for.
Prosecutors say that, after Lauren Isackson was provisionally admitted to U.C.L.A., Mr. Singer directed $100,000 to a sports marketing company controlled by Jorge Salcedo, the former head men’s soccer coach at U.C.L.A. The government has charged Mr. Salcedo with conspiracy to commit racketeering, and he has pleaded not guilty.
Davina Isackson could shed light on whether the coaches of the women’s soccer team were also in on the scheme. Amanda Cromwell, the head coach of women’s soccer at U.C.L.A. since 2013, did not respond to messages.
Both Davina and Bruce Isackson will plead guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud, according to the person with knowledge of the case. Mr. Isackson will also plead guilty to money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to defraud the United States.

KIGALI — Rwanda began a week of solemn ceremonies on Sunday to commemorate the lives of 800,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutus murdered during the Rwandan genocide, a three-month-killing spree that began 25 years ago.
President Paul Kagame laid a wreath at the Gisozi genocide memorial site, where over a quarter a million of people are buried, before an afternoon of speeches and song. Later, a candelit vigil was held in the packed national soccer stadium.
""There is no way to fully comprehend the loneliness and anger of survivors and yet over and over again we have asked them to make the sacrifices necessary to give our nation new life. Emotions had to be put in a box,"" Kagame said, his tall, thin form projected onto television screens around the nation.
""We are far better Rwandans than we were. But we can be even better still. We are the last people in the world who should succumb to complacency.""
The 100 days of slaughter began on April 6, 1994, after President Juvenal Habyarimana and his counterpart Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi -- both Hutus -- were killed when their plane was shot down over the Rwandan capital. The attackers have never been identified.
Among the legacies of the genocide is the International Criminal Court, which grew out of tribunals to investigate and prosecute those responsible for atrocities committed in Rwanda and during the Balkan wars of the 1990s.
At Gisozi on Sunday, popular Rwandan artists sang songs like ""Turabunamira twiyubaka,"" meaning ""honouring them as we rebuild"".
""Remembering is necessary because it's only thanks to looking back at what happened (that we can) ensure that it never happens again,"" said hairdresser Olive Muhorakeye, 26.
In the late afternoon, thousands of people marched from parliament to the national soccer stadium. After they had entered, the lights were extinguished and the dark stadium was lit only by a sea of flickering candles as survivors spoke.
""I named my children after all my siblings that died,"" Samuel Dusengiyumva told the emotional crowd, before praising the actions of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), a Tutsi-led rebel movement led by Kagame that ended the genocide. ""I thank the RPF army that rescued us as the rest of world did nothing.""
As the testimonies continued, counsellors in green jackets hurried through the rows of seats as some members of the crowd wept or screamed. Others took selfies.
NEIGHBOUR TURNED ON NEIGHBOUR
The downing of Habyarimana's plane was immediately followed by killings as Hutu government soldiers and allied extremist militia began trying to exterminate the Tutsi minority.
In villages across the densely populated country, neighbour turned on neighbour. Men, women and children were hacked to death, burned alive, clubbed and shot.
As many as 10,000 people were killed daily. Seventy percent of the minority Tutsi population was wiped out, and over 10 percent of the total Rwandan population.
The fighting ended in July 1994 when the RPF, led by Kagame, swept in from Uganda and seized control of the country.
Under Kagame, any talk of ethnicity is strongly discouraged. The opposition says the tight control of the media and political sphere is also used to stifle dissent.
""The ruling party has decided to adopt dictatorship from early days after the genocide as they said they were protecting the national sovereignty, but now I feel that should end,"" opposition figure Victoire Ingabire told Reuters.
""The government should let the opposition politicians work freely because denying them their rights will create problems. Twenty-five years is enough, the government should let people be free to express their opinions.""
Kagame, who won nearly 99 percent of the vote in 2017 polls on a 96 percent turnout, rebuffs such criticism, pointing to Rwanda's strong economic growth and relative peace since the genocide. In Sunday's speech, he also issued a challenge to anyone who might threaten the country.
""What happened here will never happen again. For those (who) ... want to mess with us ... we will mess up with them big time,"" he said.

COPENHAGEN — Chinese pandas Xing Er and Mao Sun are settling into their new home at Copenhagen Zoo.
Their 160 million Danish crowns ($24 million) enclosure was opened to the public on Thursday by Denmark's Crown Princess Mary after the animals were officially welcomed on Wednesday.
""We're enjoying the sun today - it couldn't be better. A lot of guests will come today to see the real life pandas,"" the Australian-born princess told reporters on Thursday.
""That a zoo has pandas is unique and can be compared to advancing in the Champions League,"" zoo spokesperson Jacob Munkholm Hoeck said, likening it to the elite soccer tournament.
The zoo is hoping to start a breeding programme with the animals.
""We have a female panda named Mao Sun and a male panda called Xing Er and they are five and six years old ... In the wild they live on their own, just like here. But once every year when the female is on heat, we'll bring them together and then we hope they can make panda babies,"" the spokesman said.
Queen Margrethe cut the ribbon on the animals' new enclosure during a ceremony on Wednesday which drew a small number of protesters. A few protesters waving Tibetan flags were also gathered outside of the zoo on Thursday.
Danish-Chinese relations have improved markedly since a low point 10 years ago, when Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen met the Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, who Beijing brands as a dangerous separatist.
Copenhagen Zoo, which hit the headlines for the killing and public dissection of a healthy giraffe five years ago, has become the 27th of the world's around 10,000 zoos to have pandas, and the ninth in Europe.

BRUSSELS — The European Commission charged Valve, the owner of a video distribution platform, and five game publishers on Friday with preventing EU consumers from shopping around within the European Union to find the best deal for the games they offer.
The case is the latest move by EU antitrust regulators against cross-border curbs on online trade, key to what is seen as a major part of economic growth in the 28-country bloc.
The Commission, which oversees competition policy in the 28 EU countries, said that the companies were Valve Corp, the owner of the world's largest video game distribution platform 'Steam', and five game makers - Bandai Namco, Capcom, Focus Home, Koch Media and ZeniMax.
""In a true digital single market, European consumers should have the right to buy and play video games of their choice regardless of where they live in the EU,"" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said.
The Commission has sent what it calls a ""statement of objections"" to the companies, allowing them to reply and request hearings to present their arguments.
Companies found guilty of anti-competitive behavior can be fined up to 10 percent of their annual global turnover.
The Commission said it was concerned that Valve and the five game publishers agreed to prevent cross-border sales by geo-blocking the 'activation keys' that enable consumers to be able to play games.
This may have prevented consumers from buying cheaper games available in other EU countries.
EU antitrust regulators opened its investigation in February 2017, at the same time also looking into online sales of electronics and hotel rooms.
EU rules prohibit geographically based restrictions that undermine online shopping and cross-border sales. Last month, it fined Nike for blocking cross-border sales of soccer merchandise.

SEOUL, South Korea — Wildfires fanned by strong winds raged through hills and villages along the northeastern coast of South Korea on Thursday night and Friday morning, scorching hundreds of homes and forcing thousands to evacuate as the government declared a national disaster.
By Friday afternoon, tens of thousands of firefighters, police officers and soldiers had managed to contain the largest fires, which left at least one person dead, officials said.
Most of the 4,000 people who had fled homes on Thursday, creating chaotic traffic jams along narrow mountain roads, returned by Friday, the government said.
President Moon Jae-in declared the wildfires a national disaster on Friday, instructing his government to direct all necessary manpower and resources to fight the flames and provide relief for distressed villagers.
Mr. Moon also asked his government to consider designating the affected area a special disaster zone so that victims there could get discounts on medical and national insurance premiums, as well as other government subsidies. His government has previously declared five disaster zones in the past two years in the aftermath of floods, earthquakes and typhoons.
This week’s wildfires have burned an estimated 1,297 acres of wooded land, the equivalent of over 730 soccer fields.
The fires were believed to have been started by sparks from an electric transformer that was shaken by strong winds on Thursday, according to officials at the National Fire Agency.
As flames raced downhill, villagers and teenagers on field trips in the area were evacuated to schools in nearby towns. More than 50 schools in the region asked their students to stay home on Friday.
The region is close to the border with North Korea and near where South Korea hosted the
2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics
. The blaze was one of the worst wildfires since 2005, when 2,400 acres of wooded land, as well as
a centuries-old Buddhist temple
, were destroyed on the east coast.

For Arike Ogunbowale, the trip to the top of the Empire State Building on Wednesday was unusually fast.
It had been arranged for her to bypass the lines and take express elevators to the observatory on the morning she was to become a professional basketball player. In the hours leading to the 2019 W.N.B.A. draft, these kinds of experiences did not faze Ogunbowale. Not after she had become one of the
most recognizable faces in college basketball
after hitting a pair of buzzer-beaters for Notre Dame in last year’s Final Four — one to slay Connecticut, the other to best Mississippi State and win the national championship.
“Nah, I’m used to life throwing new things at me now,” Ogunbowale said with a smile as she looked out over the New York skyline.
Even for the relentless Ogunbowale, the past week has brought a particular kind of whiplash.
On Wednesday night, the Dallas Wings selected her fifth in the draft, after the Las Vegas Aces took her college teammate Jackie Young with the top pick.
“You know, Dallas is a great place, and they have a great coach there, so I’m really excited,” Ogunbowale said, referring to Brian Agler, who has won the league title with teams in Seattle and Los Angeles. “I’m ready to get started.”
The draft followed her vintage set of performances in this season’s Final Four: 23 points in another win over Connecticut, and a game-high 31 points in the
national title game against Baylor
. Ogunbowale’s final shots came after a drive to the basket that yielded two free throws in the waning seconds, her team trailing by 2 points.
Then, the unthinkable: a miss. And a championship lost. Ogunbowale’s painful moment played out on the national stage, too, amplified in part by her previous success. Her mother, Yolanda, raced down from the stands after the game to reassure her, to say how proud she was.
“Over time, she’s going to realize that she won’t be defined by that moment,” Yolanda said Wednesday, hours before her daughter would hear her name called at the W.N.B.A. draft at Nike’s New York headquarters. “I was just hurting for her, and for her teammates, because they wanted it so bad.”
And there would be no time to process. A late Sunday night game turned into a Monday morning flight to South Bend, Ind., where Ogunbowale has one more class to complete at Notre Dame before she graduates.
Then it was onto New York, to see the realization of a professional dream that dates back to high school in Wisconsin, though first Ogunbowale had to choose basketball over soccer. (Oddly enough, Baylor recruited her for soccer.) She and her mother both say she could have gone pro in that, too. Confidence, backed up by results, runs in the family.
The path Ogunbowale chose has worked out pretty well. Over these last few days, her strength and her network of fans have fed off each other. Yolanda said Arike’s bubbly personality had drawn people into her orbit since she was a little girl.
Fans recognized her at the airport as she headed back to school, and some approached to cheer her up. People took notice, too, up on the Empire State Building observation deck. For Ogunbowale, it is becoming clearer that everyone still sees in her that dynamic personality, that same person who hit buzzer-beaters, who scored 55 in a high school game, who can count LeBron James and Kobe Bryant among her fans.
“Kobe, LeBron, all of them, they’ve missed some important shots in their lifetime,” Ogunbowale said. “It’s a part of the game, you know? I’m not going to be able to make every shot. So I’m glad about my career, and I think I had a great four years. Everybody’s been telling me that. I mean, that’s just one shot. But what you’ve done these four years for the program, for just women’s basketball in general, is big.”
How big? After the loss, Bryant reached out directly to encourage her. There seems to be something about Ogunbowale that make people root for her (unless they are part of the Connecticut faithful, that is).
And as her mother explained, Ogunbowale engenders a two-way connection, something of particular import for W.N.B.A. teams hoping to win both on the court and at the box office.
Liamani Segura, the 10-year-old girl who sang the national anthem at the title game, wanted a picture with Ogunbowale. Segura’s father worried Ogunbowale wouldn’t want to take one after such a difficult loss. But, as Segura’s father later told Yolanda, Arike approached Segura on her own for that photograph.
“So that’s the type of person she is,” Yolanda said of her daughter. “The person who, in the midst of that pain, she took her time to do that.”
And so while few expected Ogunbowale to be the first overall pick on Wednesday night, everyone wanted to hear from her, as she headed to Bleacher Report to talk about her favorite sneakers and to CBS for an on-camera interview, before getting down to the serious business of choosing a draft night outfit.
Erin Kane, Ogunbowale’s agent, had selected several options, and they headed to Express to see a stylist.
“You look great in a jumpsuit,” the stylist said as Ogunbowale settled on a sea-foam green one.
“Oh, I know,” Ogunbowale replied, ready for her close-up.

SYDNEY — Sydney FC's top of the table A-League clash against Perth Glory this month has been moved away from the Sydney Cricket Ground after a furore over the 'dangerous' pitch at the iconic stadium during the weekend.
Australia's players' union joined Melbourne Victory boss Kevin Muscat in slamming the SCG pitch after visiting midfielder Terry Antonis suffered a knee injury during a match against Sydney FC on Saturday night.
Head of Leagues Greg O'Rourke said that although the Football Federation Australia (FFA) considered the surface to be ""playable and safe"", the April 18 fixture would be moved to Jubilee Oval ""in the best interests of all stakeholders"".
""The SCG's (cricket) wicket block ... compromises the uniformity of the field for football in particular,"" he said in a joint statement with Sydney FC and the SCG.
Antonis fell to the ground untouched on the edge of the cricket square during a 2-1 loss for his side in a clash between the last two Australian champions.
Professional Footballers Australia (PFA) called for an independent investigation into how the match was allowed to go ahead given the 'deplorable state' of the pitch, which the body said posed a clear danger to player safety.
The SCG is being used by soccer, rugby league and rugby union teams in addition to hosting its usual cricket and Australian Rules matches while the neighbouring Sydney Football Stadium (SFS) is re-built.
Some 3,000 square metres of turf were relaid after the surface was torn up during a rugby union match last month.
Sydney FC travel to city rivals Western Sydney Wanderers next weekend but are assured of still being in second place behind Perth, who are six points clear at the top of the A-League, going into the match the following week.
""This is a hugely important fixture with first playing second and we want the narrative to be about the football,"" Sydney FC Chief Executive Danny Townsend said.
""This is a decision made in the viewing interest of members and supporters.""
The SCG has hosted test cricket since 1882 and was the venue for hundreds of rugby league and union matches before the SFS was completed in 1988.

WASHINGTON — U.S. Representative Eric Swalwell said on Monday he would seek the Democratic nomination for president, joining a crowded field seeking to take on Republican Donald Trump in the 2020 election.
Swalwell, a third-term congressman from a California district south of San Francisco, made the announcement during a taping of CBS's ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,"" which airs later on Monday. The program tweeted a clip of Swalwell saying he was running for president.
Swalwell said tackling student debt and gun violence were among the reasons he jumped into the Democratic primary race.
""None of that is going to change until we get a leader who is willing to go big on the issues we take on, be bold in the solutions we offer, and do good in the way that we govern. I'm ready to solve these problems. I'm running for president,"" Swalwell said.
Swalwell, 38, is now among the youngest candidates vying for the 2020 Democratic nomination, along with Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and Representative Tulsi Gabbard from Hawaii, both of whom are 37. Thirty-five is the minimum age to serve as U.S. president.
Swalwell cited his work on the House Intelligence Committee and his founding of Future Forum, a group of more than 25 Democratic lawmakers that visits universities and community colleges to discuss issues important to millennial voters like student loan debt and climate change, among the reasons he would be a qualified White House candidate.
In his first House campaign, Swalwell defeated a Democratic incumbent who had been in office since 1973, seven years before Swalwell was born.
Since joining Congress, Swalwell has advocated for raising the cap on the portion of salary that is subject to the Social Security payroll tax. He has also proposed a ""mobile Congress"" that would allow lawmakers to cast votes remotely from their districts.
Swalwell grew up in Iowa and California. He attended Campbell University in North Carolina on a soccer scholarship for two years before transferring to the University of Maryland, where he earned his bachelor's and law degrees.
Other House lawmakers in the Democratic race include Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio, who announced his bid last week. Former Representative Beto O'Rourke from Texas is also a contender.
U.S. senators vying for the Democratic presidential nomination include Kamala Harris of California, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.

The spectacle of Julian Assange, bearded and haggard, resisting arrest while London police officers dragged him through the street, punctuated the end of seven confounding years inside the Ecuadorean Embassy, where he lived with his cat in a small corner room as the world’s most famous self-proclaimed political refugee.
Mr. Assange, 47, has long fashioned himself as a crusader for revealing secrets. The internet group he founded, WikiLeaks, published
caches of classified American government communications
, as well as
emails hacked by Russian intelligence
clearly intended to damage the presidential candidacy of Hillary Clinton.
Though arrested Thursday morning by the British for skipping bail, Mr. Assange was immediately charged in the United States for conspiracy to hack a government computer.
To supporters, Mr. Assange was a martyr and champion of free speech. To the United States government, he was a pariah and a
lackey of the Kremlin
. But it was the hardened opinion of Ecuador’s government that perhaps mattered most.
He had become an unwanted houseguest.
At the tiny red-brick embassy, he continued to run his internet group, conducted news conferences before hundreds of fawning admirers from a balcony, rode his skateboard in the halls, and played host to a parade of visitors, including Lady Gaga and Pamela Anderson, a rumored lover who brought vegan sandwiches.
On Thursday, Ms. Anderson sent
out a batch of Twitter messages
attacking the arrest as a “vile injustice” and called Britain and the United States “devils and liars and thieves.”
In interviews with The New York Times in 2016, as part of a long look at his ties to Russia, Mr. Assange denied any link to Russian intelligence, in particular regarding the leaked Democratic emails. Mrs. Clinton and the Democrats were “whipping up a neo-McCarthyist hysteria about Russia,” he said. There is “no concrete evidence” that what WikiLeaks publishes comes from intelligence agencies, he said, even as he indicated that he would happily accept such material.
Small as they were, Mr. Assange’s living quarters at the embassy, close to the lavish self-indulgence of Harrods, the famous department store, did not cramp his desire to remain in the limelight.
Mr. Assange had an office equipped with a bed, sunlamp, phone, computer, kitchenette, shower, treadmill and bookshelves. Three years ago, one person familiar with the setup called it “a gas station with two attendants.”
Vaughan Smith, who had been a longtime supporter of Mr. Assange and helped put up his bail money, said that “Julian’s a big bloke, with big bones, and he fills the room physically and intellectually.”
“It’s a tiny embassy with a tiny balcony,” he added, “small, hot and with not great air flow, and it must be jolly difficult for everyone there.”
But from there, Mr. Assange for years held court for admirers and famous curiosity seekers, among them the soccer star Eric Cantona, and Nigel Farage, the pro-Brexit radio host and former head of U.K. Independence Party.
Still, Mr. Assange’s isolation was wearing on him, a friend said on Thursday, especially the long, lonely weekends in an essentially empty embassy he could not leave.
Even his friends have described him as difficult, a narcissist with an outsized view of his importance and a disinterest in mundane matters like personal hygiene.
He was becoming deeply depressed and wondered about simply walking out, the friend said, speaking on condition of anonymity. And relations with his hosts were becoming deeply strained, even adversarial.
A copy of a 2014 letter from Juan Falconí Puig, then Ecuador’s ambassador to Britain, to the Foreign Ministry, seen by The New York Times, outlined the growing resentment between the diplomats and Mr. Assange over his behavior at the embassy.
Among Mr. Falconí’s top concerns was Mr. Assange’s penchant for riding a skateboard and playing soccer with visitors. His skateboarding, Mr. Falconí said, had “damaged floors, walls and doors.”
The ambassador said the soccer games had destroyed embassy equipment. When an embassy security agent stopped the game and took away the ball, Mr. Assange “began to shake, insult and push the agent,” reclaimed the ball and then “launched the ball at his body.”
The letter said Mr. Assange had invited a television reporter to interview them at the embassy and had showed the visitor off-limits parts of the building.
At one point, according to the letter, Mr. Assange used the alarm setting on a megaphone “to attract the police” to record them for the show.
“This last action, in the middle of the night, was a clear attempt to annoy the police,” Mr. Falconí wrote.
Another time, the letter said, Mr. Assange “violently hit the embassy control room door” demanding in a “threatening manner” that one of the guards come out to speak to him.
The guards came out, only to be harassed by Mr. Assange, who yelled and shoved them, Mr. Falconí wrote.
Mr. Assange’s long presence in the embassy, long after the Ecuadorean president who granted him political asylum had been replaced, finally became too much for the Ecuadorean government. President Lenin Moreno, elected in 2017, explained the decision on Twitter and in a video.
“In a sovereign decision Ecuador withdrew the asylum status to Julian Assange after his repeated violations to international conventions and daily-life protocols,” he said.
He accused Mr. Assange of having installed forbidden “electronic and distortion equipment,” accessing the embassy’s security files without permission, blocking the embassy’s security cameras and mistreating its personnel, including guards.
In March of last year, the Ecuadorean government severed his internet access, saying that he had violated an agreement to stop commenting on, or trying to influence, the politics of other countries.
The government also limited his visitors and required him to clean his bathroom and look after his cat. Mr. Assange then sued the Ecuadorean government in October, claiming that it was violating his rights.
He hired the Spanish human rights jurist, Baltasar Garzón, who filed suit against the Ecuadorean government in its own courts, saying Mr. Assange’s rights were violated. He also filed a second complaint with the Inter-American Human Rights Commission, an international body that mediates rights issues.
Both cases were rejected by officials, and further angered Mr. Moreno’s government.
A recent leak of papers last month related to Mr. Moreno, which the government blamed on WikiLeaks, further angered officials before Mr. Assange’s eviction. The vast trove of emails, text messages and photos were known in Ecuador as the INA papers, named after a company linked to the president’s brother.
The leaked papers, first published by an independent Ecuadorean news site, described an extravagant life of the president and his family that included lavish dinners, expensive watches and trips around the world.
They included text messages between the president’s wife telling friends about family trips to Switzerland and New York and private pictures of Mr. Moreno, including one of him in a hotel room bed with a lobster meal. WikiLeaks denied involvement in the leaks, though it promoted the story on its Twitter site.
Days later, Mr. Moreno said that Mr. Assange had “repeatedly violated” the terms of his asylum and that Mr. Assange could not “hack private accounts or phones.”
“Finally,” Mr. Moreno said in his statement announcing the withdrawal of asylum, “two days ago, WikiLeaks, Mr. Assange’s allied organization, threatened the government of Ecuador. My government has nothing to fear and does not act under threats.”
Mr. Moreno appeared to be referring to an effort by WikiLeaks to reveal the scale of surveillance of Mr. Assange within the embassy.
The editor in chief of WikiLeaks, Kristinn Hrafnsson, charged in a news conference this week that there had been “extensive spying” on Mr. Assange, and that Ecuador was part of a plot to extradite him to the United States.
“What we have established is security has monitored his every move and every meeting with visitors,” Mr. Hrafnsson said. “We also know there was a request to hand over visit logs and video recordings from within the embassy.”
“We believe this has been handed over to the Trump administration,” Mr. Hrafnsson added.
Mr. Hrafnsson also charged that the spying was part of a 3 million-euro extortion plot against Mr. Assange involving sex tapes.
The British police arrested Mr. Assange on Thursday on charges that he had jumped bail after his initial arrest in 2010 on a Swedish warrant.
The Swedes had wanted to question Mr. Assange on allegations of sexual misconduct and rape; in June 2012, Mr. Assange, even then fearing extradition to the United States, left his backers to lose their bail money while he successfully sought political asylum in the Ecuadorean Embassy.
Only in May 2017, after many attempts to secure Mr. Assange and finally interview him on those charges, did Sweden give up and drop its arrest warrant.
Mr. Assange also gradually offended some of his early supporters, like Edward Snowden and the heiress Jemima Goldsmith Khan. He suffered from vitamin D deficiency, dental problems and depression. For some, he became a sort of joke, and many mocked his fear of extradition.
But there were times when thousands of supporters cheered Mr. Assange’s work and what many considered his martyrdom in the name of individual rights and internet freedom. Hundreds would sometimes gather outside the embassy, to hear Mr. Assange address them from that tiny balcony.
British police officers arrived Thursday about 9:15 a.m. at the embassy, where the ambassador offered to serve Mr. Assange documentation revoking his asylum. He didn’t go easily.
He resisted arrest and had to be restrained by officers, who struggled to handcuff him and received assistance from officers outside the embassy.
“This is unlawful, I’m not leaving,” he told them, according to the account given at the Westminster Magistrates Court, where Mr. Assange later appeared, his silver hair tied in a bun, his tight lips visible behind a long, white beard, and looking composed in a navy suit.
Outside the court, a flock of cameras were pointing toward the guarded entrance, and a group of protesters chanted feebly “Free, free, free Assange.”
After Mr. Assange took his seat in court, a supporter wearing a scruffy fluorescent jacket gave him an enthusiastic thumbs-up from the public gallery.
Mr. Assange turned his head clinically toward the gallery, raised his arm, and returned the gesture.
While awaiting the lawyers to enter, Mr. Assange read from a book, which he raised for the media to see: “History of the National Security State,” by Gore Vidal.

BRUSSELS — European summits, jaded Englishmen have said, are like soccer: they go into extra-time, and the Germans always win.
For the journalists covering them, it is like commentating live on a match played behind closed doors: only partial information leaks out from self-promoting rival players, and even when it’s over, the final score is often far from clear.
Another high-stakes summit coming up on Wednesday is likely to be a replay of the same fixture 10 days ago, when British Prime Minister Theresa May sat in late-night talks with fellow EU leaders trying to delay Brexit until June.
Hundreds of journalists were gathered in the cavernous atrium of the Justus Lipsius Building, home to the European Council of EU national leaders.
For Reuters, the game starts days before such summits begin. Reporters tap their sources in capitals across Europe and EU institutions in Brussels, trying to work out who wants what from the meeting.
When the leaders file in, talking to cameras without translators in the 24 EU languages, our multilingual team relays their words instantly.
Once they're in, the summit match starts in earnest.
Last month, May began the closed-door meeting by explaining her plans and taking questions from peers. She was looking for an extension to the Brexit deadline to give her more time to try to win backing from Britain’s parliament for her plan to exit the European Union.
The first sign of a story was that May's presentation before she had to leave the room lasted well over an hour, much longer than previous such sessions. But was that good or bad for Theresa May?
One UK government source told us it had gone ""OK"". But our sources among EU officials and national diplomats made clear in hushed conversations and text messages that it had gone ""very badly"" for her indeed.
A flurry of contradictory messages and rumors began to emerge. This is when reporters need to hold their nerve, when the urge to be quick can compete with the need to be right.
As the other 27 discussed May's pitch among themselves, French President Emmanuel Macron was pushing to end the agony and get Britain out almost immediately. German Chancellor Angela Merkel urged caution. Europe's power couple huddled with summit chair Donald Tusk, drafting and redrafting a response to Britain.
Outside the room, Bulgaria's ambassador tweeted a picture, worthy of Caravaggio, of envoys crowding round one version on a screen. (https://twitter.com/DTzantchev/status/1108807850397261826)
Hours later, as reporters started preparing for yet another all-nighter, Reuters got word from upstairs of the breakthrough: a two-stage approach that might mean Brexit in May, or April. First word from one source a little after 10 p.m. meant rapid checks with others.
At nearly midnight, all was confirmed in a flurry of news conferences. By 2 a.m. our final stories were published, a much earlier finish than some EU summits.
The days that followed brought the after-match analysis. British lawmakers and others denounced the beleaguered prime minister's performance. May had managed to take the summit into extra time. But it was the French who took the initiative early on and, again, the Germans who ran out winners.

PARIS — President Emmanuel Macron of France said on Sunday that he wanted to create a national day of commemoration for
the 1994 genocide in Rwanda
, which has been a longstanding source of tension between the two countries.
Mr. Macron said in a statement that he wanted to create a national day of remembrance on April 7, the date 25 years ago that Rwanda’s Hutu majority began systematically massacring members of the Tutsi minority, leaving an
estimated
800,000 to one million people dead.
“On this day of commemoration for the 25th anniversary of the Tutsi genocide in Rwanda, the president of the republic expresses his solidarity with the Rwandan people and his compassion for the victims and their families,” the statement said.
Rwanda, led by President
Paul Kagame
, has long
accused France of complicity
in the genocide and of helping some of the perpetrators escape,
poisoning ties
between the two countries, even though relations have warmed since Mr. Macron’s election in 2017.
France has been accused of providing weapons and military training to the Hutu-dominated government in the years that led up to the genocide, and of failing to prevent or even supporting the massacres when they started, despite the presence of French peacekeeping soldiers.
Ibuka France, a group that advocates remembrance of the genocide, praised Mr. Macron’s announcement. Marcel Kabanda, the head of the group, told Agence France-Presse that Ibuka France had suggested the idea in a meeting with Mr. Macron on Friday.
Mr. Macron did not say what the day of commemoration would entail or how he would create it. He could proceed by decree, or have his government present a bill in Parliament, where his party has a majority in the more powerful lower house.
France has admitted mistakes in how it handled the killings but has always denied the accusations of complicity. After meeting with survivors and members of Ibuka France on Friday, Mr. Macron
ordered a two-year government study
of France’s role in the genocide.
The study will be led by a commission of eight historians and researchers. They will have access to official French archives covering the period between 1990 and 1994 in order to “analyze the role and involvement of France” during the massacres and to help shape French school curriculums, Mr. Macron said.
In Rwanda,
a week of commemorations
started on Sunday, as did
100 days of mourning
for victims of the genocide. Mr. Kagame laid a wreath and lit a flame at the
Gisozi memorial
site in Kigali, the capital. Over 250,000 people are believed to be buried at the site.
A remembrance walk was scheduled to go from the Rwandan Parliament building to the national soccer stadium. Several heads of state were expected to attend, but not Mr. Macron, who sent Hervé Berville, a member of France’s Parliament and survivor of the Rwandan genocide, as his representative.
Mr. Berville, 29, was evacuated by the French Army at the age of 4 and adopted by a couple in Brittany. He was part of
the wave of first-time politicians
elected to the lower house of Parliament in 2017 for Mr. Macron’s party.
“It is both a source of pride and a great responsibility to go there to represent France,” Mr. Berville
told RFI radio
on Tuesday.
Mr. Macron also announced last week that more resources would be granted to the French judicial authorities who are working to identify and
prosecute those suspected of perpetrating
the genocide,
some of whom fled to France
after the violence ended.

THE ALARMING PALSY OF JAMES ORR
By Tom Lee
“The Alarming Palsy of James Orr” starts with a nod to one of the most recognizable plot openers of all time: An ordinary man wakes up one morning to find that he’s been transformed overnight by a grotesque affliction.
By beginning his first novel on such a blatantly Kafkaesque note, it’s as if the British writer Tom Lee is announcing on Page 1 that he’s forgoing all subtlety when it comes to his central metaphor — physical disfigurement as a product of bourgeois dread, a sum of the daily spiritual paper cuts that aspirational living can inflict.
James Orr’s particular metamorphosis, at least on the surface, is far more pedestrian than Gregor Samsa’s famous turn as a giant insect. A doctor immediately diagnoses James with Bell’s palsy, a relatively common condition that paralyzes the nerves on one side of the face. She assures James and his wife, Sarah, a touch too casually, that “only a small percentage do not return to more or less normal.”
Nevertheless, the protagonist’s lopsided mug is a shocking sight. “The left-hand side of James’s face had collapsed, a balloon with the air gone out of it, a melted waxwork,” giving the unsettling “impression of two different faces, two different people, welded savagely together.” But more than the physical symptoms, the comorbid psychological trauma is what tips James into a hellish downward spiral, which Lee draws us into with unrelenting dread and deadpan wit.
At first James treats his recovery like a much-deserved vacation for a hardworking father of two. He’s free to wander his neighborhood, an idyllic development carved out of the dense woods of a former Victorian estate. Yet as his palsy fails to improve, the hallmarks of upper-middle-class ease, which used to provide him almost smug levels of satisfaction, begin to rankle. Everything from the size of a neighbor’s dog (“there was something a little conceited in having an animal this big”), to the gratuitous shirtlessness of the unmarried serial D.I.Y.-er a few doors down (“it was still only March, after all”), to his wife’s “pragmatism and lack of drama” swirls together, amassing into a more serious crisis. James suffers a series of humiliations carrying the taint of failed manhood: He bursts into tears while presiding over a residents’ committee meeting, a friendly neighborhood soccer game turns into an outlet for his mounting aggression, an attempt to seduce his wife after weeks of sleeping apart goes disturbingly awry. Not surprisingly, Lee works the symbol of James’s flaccid face on several levels.
Along with impotence, sudden illness is a recurring concern in Lee’s work (including a 2009 story collection, “Greenfly,” not available in the United States). It’s an experience Lee knows intimately, as he addressed in a pair of extraordinary autobiographical essays for The Dublin Review a few years ago. One recounts the time, just before “Greenfly” was published, when he was flattened by an anxiety disorder that left him feeling as if he’d “forgotten how to be”; and the other the medically induced coma he underwent for a case of pneumonia so serious his doctor dubbed him “the sickest man in London” (and his ensuing intensive care unit psychosis, which is just as horrifying as it sounds).
In both essays, Lee reckons with the decline of one’s health as a micro-apocalypse — life is separated into a “before” and an “after” — and the almost dystopian alienation that emerges between sufferers and the well. In “James Orr,” he explores these same themes with greater artfulness and delicious doses of body horror and contemporary British social satire. While James doesn’t become an oversize bug, the juxtaposition of his common affliction and Lee’s use of familiar genre conventions adds up to something fresh, highlighting the terrifying plausibility — perhaps even inevitability — of the real-life transformations Kafka predicted to be lurking in our DNA, waiting to wreak havoc on an otherwise ordinary morning.
Stephan Lee is an associate director at Bustle and a former editor at Entertainment Weekly. He is at work on a debut novel.

KHARTOUM — Eleven people were killed in the Sudanese capital Khartoum on Tuesday, including six members of ""state forces"", the government's spokesman said on Wednesday, as protesters pushed for an end to President Omar al-Bashir's 30-year rule.
Uniformed personnel from Sudan's National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) twice tried to disperse thousands of anti-government protesters camped outside the Defence Ministry, the minister said, citing a report by the Khartoum state police chief.
But government soldiers guarding the compound came out both times to protect the demonstrators, firing shots in the air and deploying troops around the area.
The protests are the most sustained challenge Bashir has faced in his three decades in power.
The Defence Ministry is in a compound that also houses Bashir's residence and the NISS headquarters.
The government spokesman and Information Minister Hassan Ismail said the Khartoum state police chief had delivered a report stating that 11 people had died in ""incidents yesterday (Tuesday), including six members of the regular forces"". He gave no further details on how they died.
Ismail also quoted the police chief as saying the authorities had foiled a ""criminal plot"" to burn down some police stations in some parts of the capital.
NISS warned in a statement that it had detected ""negative developments"" toward vandalism, theft and terrorizing innocent people and said it was ready to act.
""The service calls on honorable citizens to be careful of attempts to drag the country toward a complete security breakdown,"" the statement said.
It added that it was able to ""rein in the unruly elements through good advice or by force within the limits of the law"".
The head of the main opposition Umma Party, Sadiq al-Mahdi, said on Tuesday that around 20 people have been killed and dozens wounded in dawn attacks on the sit-in outside the defense ministry since it began on Saturday.
DANCING, SINGING
Soldiers were heavily deployed around a sit-in outside the Defence Ministry on Wednesday, as several thousand protesters danced, sang and chanted slogans calling on Bashir to step down.
Some watched soccer matches on giant television screens mounted on special trucks.
The demonstrators have been camped outside the compound since Saturday in an escalation of protests that have shaken Sudan since December.
Sudan's Health Ministry reported that Khartoum hospitals had treated 72 cases of people suffering from tear gas and 16 minor injuries. First aid vehicles were stationed near the protest site to deal with emergency cases, it said.
There were no reports of attempts to disperse the protests on Wednesday. The sit-in area had expanded slightly, with hundreds of people entering and leaving despite temperatures rising above 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit), a Reuters witness said. Some people blocked streets to the east of the compound with stones.
Protesters chanted ""Fall, that's all!"", ""The people want to build a new Sudan"", and ""Our army protects us"".
Military trucks and troops were deployed around the compound, stopping cars from entering the area. Police and NISS forces appeared not to be present.
""With the army's presence, we feel safe. The army is protecting us and we will continue the sit-in until the regime falls,"" said Ayman Abdullah, a 23-year-old engineering graduate taking part in the sit-in.
Videos posted by the Sudanese Professionals' Association, the main protest organizer, and others on social media showed demonstrators dancing, singing and chanting slogans.
A video shared by the opposition Sudanese Congress Party showed a large group of protesters marching toward the sit-in and cheering with a massive Sudanese flag draped over them.
Since Dec. 19, Sudan has been rocked by persistent protests sparked by the government's attempt to raise the price of bread, and an economic crisis including fuel and cash shortages.
Opposition figures have called for the military to help negotiate an end to Bashir's nearly three decades in power and a transition to democracy.

BOSTON — Actress Felicity Huffman has agreed to plead guilty in the sweeping college admissions cheating scam that has ensnared wealthy parents and athletic coaches at some of the nation's most selective universities, federal authorities said Monday.
The ""Desperate Housewives"" star and 12 other prominent parents will admit to charges in the scheme, which authorities say involved rigging standardized test scores and bribing coaches at such prestigious schools as Yale and Georgetown.
Huffman was accused of paying a consultant, Rick Singer, $15,000 disguised as a charitable donation to boost her daughter's SAT score. Authorities say the 56-year-old actress also discussed going through with the same plan for her younger daughter, but she ultimately decided not to.
Other parents charged in the scheme include prominent figures in law, finance, fashion, the food and beverage industry and other fields. It's the biggest college admissions scandal ever prosecuted by the U.S. Justice Department, embroiling elite universities across the country and laying bare the lengths to which status-seeking parents will go to secure their children a coveted spot.
Singer met with Huffman and her husband, 69-year-old actor William H. Macy, at their Los Angeles home and explained to them he ""controlled"" a testing center and could have somebody secretly change their daughter's answers, authorities say. Singer told investigators Huffman and her husband agreed to the plan.
Macy was not charged; authorities have not said why.
Huffman will plead guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud, according to court documents.
Michael Center, the former men's tennis coach at the University of Texas at Austin, has also agreed to plead guilty in the scheme, prosecutors said Monday. Center was accused of accepting nearly $100,000 to help a non-tennis playing applicant get admitted as a recruit.
California real estate developer Bruce Isackson and his wife, Davina Isackson, who are pleading guilty to participating in both the athletic recruitment and exam rigging schemes, are cooperating with prosecutors for a chance at a lighter sentence.
""We have worked cooperatively with the prosecutors and will continue to do so as we take full responsibility for our bad judgment,"" they said in a statement.
Fellow actress Lori Loughlin, who played Aunt Becky on the sitcom ""Full House,"" and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli are charged with paying $500,000 in bribes to get their two daughters admitted to the University of Southern California as crew recruits, even though neither participated in the sport.
Loughlin and Giannulli are not among those who've agreed to plead guilty and haven't publicly addressed the allegations.
Singer, the consultant, pleaded guilty to charges including racketeering conspiracy on March 12, the same day the allegations against the parents and coaches were made public in the so-called Operations Varsity Blues investigation. Singer secretly recorded his conversations with the parents, helping to build the case against them, after agreeing to work with investigators in the hopes of getting a lesser sentence.
Several coaches have also been charged, including longtime tennis coach Gordon Ernst who's accused of getting $2.7 million in bribes to designate at least 12 applicants as recruits to Georgetown. Ernst, who was also the personal tennis coach for former first lady Michelle Obama and her daughters, and a number of other coaches have pleaded not guilty.
Former Yale University women's soccer coach Rudy Meredith has pleaded guilty to accepting bribes to help students get admitted and has been cooperating with authorities. Stanford's former sailing coach John Vandemoer also pleaded guilty to accepting $270,000 in contributions to the program for agreeing to recommend two prospective students for admission.
Stanford University expelled a student who lied about her sailing credentials in her application, which was linked to the scandal. The university quietly announced it had rescinded the student's admission in a short statement posted on its website April 2 after determining ""some of the material in the student's application is false.""
University officials previously said the student was admitted without the recommendation of Vandemoer.

AUGUSTA, Georgia — Jennifer Kupcho struck a blow for gender equality and entered golf history books on Saturday when she was crowned Augusta National Women's Amateur champion by firing a final-round five-under 67 for a four-shot win over Maria Fassi.
Following the first women's competitive round played at Augusta National, it was a double celebration for Kupcho as she hoisted the silver and gold Tiffany-designed cup at a club that just seven years ago did not have a single woman member.
""You are now part of history of Augusta National along with all the great Masters champions who have been right here in this Butler Cabin,"" Augusta National chairman Fred Ridley said as he presented Kupcho with her trophy in the same location where the Masters champion is presented with the winner's green jacket.
With Augusta National set to host the Masters next week, Fassi and Kupcho proved that women can also produce nerve-jangling drama with a back-nine battle worthy of any major.
Kupcho's elation was mixed with relief as she struggled with a migraine and blurred vision from the eighth through 11th holes that threatened to scuttle her title hopes.
""I actually got a migraine on the eighth green and kind of over to the left I just couldn't see it was blurry,"" said Kupcho. ""I told my caddie I'm looking for you to read the putts and tell me where to hit it and I will do my best to hit it there.
""Amazing enough, I have gotten these migraines before so I knew the blurriness would go away and I would just have a headache. On the 11th tee was where it finally started to go away and I could finally see.""
The Masters is often decided on the back nine on a Sunday and that was the case for the women who played their final round on Saturday, as Kupcho played the final six holes in five under.
Showing why she is the world's top-ranked amateur, the 21-year-old carded birdies at 15, 16 and 18 along with a brilliant eagle on the par five 13th that wiped out Fassi's two stroke lead.
Opened for play in 1933, Augusta National became the private sanctuary for some of the world's most powerful men and it was almost 80 years before the club welcomed its first women members in 2012, former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and financier Darla Moore.
GREAT STAGES
After the opening two rounds of the 54-hole tournament were held at Champions Retreat in nearby Evans, the women finally got the opportunity to step on to one of the sport's great stages.
The first competitive round played by women at Augusta National attracted a large crowd but it was not the typical gallery seen at the Masters.
The crowd more resembled one you might find at a U.S. women's soccer game with plenty of teenage girls and mothers and fathers with children in tow.
While the sight of women battling for a trophy was new for Augusta National, so were the sounds as the galleries offered encouragement with shouts of ""Atta girl"" and ""Way to go girls"".
There were plenty of Augusta members in their iconic green jackets who mingled among the crowd cheering on the golfers while others offered support on social media.
""So cool seeing these women live out their dreams right now,"" tweeted Rory McIlroy, who will be in Augusta next week looking to complete a career grand slam.
Following a Masters tradition, the round began with ceremonial tee shots. LPGA greats Nancy Lopez, Pak Se-ri, Lorena Ochoa and Annika Sorenstam did the honors.
After American Anna Redding struck the first competitive shot, the focus shifted to Kupcho and Fassi, the two close friends and college rivals sharing an emotional hug before teeing off.
The two embraced again on the 18th green, promising more battles in the future.
""I did all I could, she played a great game she finished really strong and I am really proud of her and I know we are going to be battling for wins in the future,"" said Fassi. ""Yes we were competing against each other but we were friends before all of that.
""Making it at Augusta National, being the first time, it is just a dream come true.""

BEIRUT — He was the world's only sitting head of state wanted for genocide. He lost a third of his country, a quarter of its population and most of its oil resources when South Sudan broke away.
Yet Sudan's Omar al-Bashir, who came to power in a military coup in 1989, was able to keep his grip on power for 30 years in what proved to be one of Sudan's most brutal chapters.
It was not until months of popular protests erupted against him that the 75-year-old president finally lost the support of his military commanders, who arrested and deposed him Thursday.
In announcing al-Bashir's overthrow, his defense minister, Gen. Awad Mohammed Ibn Ouf, described him all too accurately as ""stubborn and persistent.""
Famous for breaking out in dance and jabbing his trademark cane in the air, al-Bashir exuded defiance even at the most critical moments of his political career.
When he was indicted by the International Criminal Court in 2009 on charges of committing crimes in Darfur, he responded by expelling a dozen aid groups working in the war-plagued region, where up to 300,000 people were killed and 2.7 million driven from their homes by militias he backed. Then, he traveled there, appearing at government-organized rallies brimming with supporters.
""Tell them all, the ICC prosecutor, the members of the court and everyone who supports this court that they are under my shoe,"" al-Bashir said, brandishing a sword. The army then mobilized troops to confront any threat to him and renewed its allegiance to him.
Since independence in 1956, Sudan has bounced between tumultuous party politics and military rule. But al-Bashir successfully presented himself as the leader of a new wave of ""political Islam,"" based on an alliance between Islamists and the military.
As a young officer, al-Bashir was groomed and trusted by the Islamist movement, which played a key role in propping him up for years.
After leading his coup with a few fellow officers, al-Bashir declared the imposition of Islamic Sharia law. The new rules included stoning and amputations as punishments. Also, Islamic judges were sent to the country's mainly animist, Christian south, fueling the civil war that was already going on for years.
One of his allies, religious scholar Hassan Turabi, invited Osama bin Laden to Sudan in 1991, prompting the U.S. to place Sudan on its list of states sponsoring terrorism. The U.S. later imposed sanctions on the government and carried out an airstrike on a factory in Sudan it said was used by al-Qaida to produce nerve gas.
Al-Bashir disputed the accusations and blamed hostile neighbors. He called bin Laden a businessman undertaking a major infrastructure project in Sudan. (After five years, bin Laden was expelled from Sudan under pressure from the U.S.)
In addition to relying on Islamist ideology, Al-Bashir used the country's oil wealth to boost a class of businessmen faithful to him and created loyal militias to protect his rule, employing them to crack down on rebels in the country's western Darfur region. The resulting atrocities led to the charges of genocide.
The indictment increased his international isolation but didn't prevent him from traveling. The strongman even attended last year's World Cup soccer final in Moscow, taking his place among other heads of state in luxury seating at the stadium. And he paid a surprise visit last December to Damascus, Syria, which has been shunned by other Arab countries because of the civil war there.
After years of promising to hold his country together amid disputes with the oil-rich south, al-Bashir quickly accepted the referendum results in 2010 that created one of the world's newest countries, South Sudan. While criticized, al-Bashir hoped to get concessions from the West in return.
Al-Bashir governed with an iron fist while also zigzagging strategically to divide his opponents. He often shuffled his aides, once firing his presidential adviser after accusing him of plotting a coup in 2012, only to bring him back as intelligence chief last year to deal with growing unrest.
When economic hardship deepened after the split with South Sudan, protests inspired by the Arab Spring uprisings broke out in the country as early as 2012. Al-Bashir at first ridiculed the protests, saying: ""They talk of an Arab Spring. Let me tell them that in Sudan we have a hot summer, a burning hot summer that burns its enemies.""
Then, when the protests persisted, he promised not to stand for re-election, only to renege and run in 2015.
""He will be remembered as someone who lied his way in power. He lied a lot,"" said Wasil Taha, a Sudanese editor of an English-language newspaper who emigrated to the U.S.
This time, the protests, combined with the economic downturn, proved to be Al-Bashir's undoing. As the pressure mounted, the genocide charges and the threat of being handed over to the International Criminal Court seemed to limit his options.
A prominent exiled Sudanese cartoonist drew a caricature of al-Bashir sitting on a throne, with one of its broken legs replaced by a brick. The caption: ""I will get down, but just tell me where to get down.""

JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's apparent election victory has deepened the divisions in an already-divided country.
Bolstered by his base of religious and working-class voters, Netanyahu can be expected to press ahead with a hard-line agenda that will likely eliminate the last hopes of a two-state solution with the Palestinians. A looming indictment in a series of corruption scandals could even accelerate these trends.
For all the talk of unity from political leaders during the campaign, Israel is a deeply tribal country. People are divided between Jews and Arabs; religious Jews and secular Jews; Jews of European ancestry and those of Middle Eastern heritage; and residents of the secular, high-tech metropolis of Tel Aviv and people from dusty, outlying towns, West Bank settlements and the conservative capital of Jerusalem.
Netanyahu, himself a secular, U.S.-educated millionaire with a propensity for cognac and cigars, has nonetheless aligned himself with downtrodden Jewish Israelis with whom he would seem to have little in common. Portraying himself as a victim of the country's ""elites,"" Netanyahu is seen as their hero.
""Netanyahu is the best prime minister the state of Israel has ever had, and we will continue to support him,"" said Alon Davidi, mayor of the southern town of Sderot.
Just two weeks ago, Davidi's town was dealing with around-the-clock air raid sirens as Palestinian militants in the neighboring Gaza Strip were bombarding southern Israeli communities with rocket fire.
It's a scene the residents of southern Israel have gotten used to since the Hamas militant group seized power in Gaza 12 years ago. It's also a constant source of frustration. Residents complained about Netanyahu's inability to stop the rockets and were furious over his latest behind-the-scenes cease-fire deal with Hamas.
But given a chance to change things in Tuesday's election, residents of Sderot voted overwhelmingly for Netanyahu's Likud party and its religious and nationalist allies.
""We are intelligent people,"" Davidi told the Army Radio station. ""We are people who know how to appreciate everything that's done for us, and I think that Netanyahu and all the right-wing parties are doing what they can do and what they believe.""
In Sderot, whose population is largely working class, religious and of Mizrahi, or Middle Eastern, descent, Netanyahu's Likud received 44% of the vote, compared with 9% for the rival Blue and White party, according to official election data. More than 80% of Sderot voted for Likud and its religions and nationalist allies.
Similar thinking took place across Israel. A look at the electoral map showed Likud and its allies sweeping the vote in smaller, outlying cities and towns, West Bank settlements and in Jerusalem, whose population is largely poor and religious.
In contrast, Blue and White, led by former military chief Benny Gantz, coasted to victory in Tel Aviv, the country's prosperous commercial and cultural center, as well as the nearby suburbs that are home to a more professional and affluent population.
On the campaign trail, Gantz sought to project an image of decency and virtue, taking aim at the corruption investigations swirling around Netanyahu and promising a clean and honest government.
In contrast, the 69-year-old Netanyahu, facing the strong likelihood of criminal charges in the coming months, sounded very much like his friend President Donald Trump. He frequently portrayed himself as the victim of a ""witch hunt"" and accused Gantz of conspiring with politicians from the country's Arab minority to topple him. Even after a decade in office, Netanyahu marketed himself as the outsider.
These different approaches were on display on election night, when preliminary results showed a close race and each candidate declared victory.
Gantz's rally looked like a celebration. Netanyahu's felt like a sporting event, with the whipped-up crowd whooping and hollering as if it were at a soccer match. Where Gantz's supporters were excited, Netanyahu's supporters — many wearing Jewish skullcaps and dancing to Mizrahi pop music — were ecstatic. His speech included a Jewish prayer and a Trump-like swipe at the ""hostile"" media.
Netanyahu's opponents finally conceded defeat Wednesday, acknowledging that he and his traditional allies control a solid majority in the 120-seat parliament.
But the process of building a coalition can require weeks of negotiations, and his smaller partners will be looking to extract control of powerful government ministries and generous budgets to promote their pet causes.
Thanks to Netanyahu's legal woes, these smaller partners have some added leverage. They will likely use Netanyahu's fear of indictment to their advantage as he seeks promises to protect him from prosecutors, perhaps by pushing legislation granting him immunity.
Netanyahu veered sharply to the right on the campaign trail to shore up support of his base, promising to begin annexing West Bank settlements if re-elected. Netanyahu's allies will try to hold him at his word.
""The new Netanyahu government will have two main goals: to get rid of the indictments looming in his future and to annex the settlements to Israel, in coordination with the Trump administration. These two goals could be summed up as 'immunity in exchange for sovereignty,'"" wrote Aluf Benn, editor of the Haaretz daily.
The annexation of Israeli settlements could spell the end for any remaining hopes of establishing an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel.
Ben-Dror Yemini, a columnist for the Yediot Ahronot daily, urged Netanyahu to consider a ""unity"" government with Gantz instead of caving in to the ""extortion"" of small hard-line parties.
""Which is the better choice: to save the country or to sanctimoniously insist that 'promises must be kept?'"" he wrote.
Such a scenario seems unlikely. After decades of doing things his way, Netanyahu seems unlikely to reach across the aisle unless he has no choice.
As he put it at his late-night victory rally: ""I'll start by assembling a right-wing government with our natural allies tonight.""

Hundreds of influential faces in global politics, art, fashion and design descended on this tiny desert kingdom last week.
By
Elizabeth Paton
DOHA, Qatar —
Victoria Beckham
came from London. Diane von Furstenberg and Alexander Wang from New York.
Pierpaolo Piccioli of Valentino
flew in from Rome, while Olivier Rousteing of Balmain and Giambattista Valli came from Paris. So did Carla Bruni, with her husband, former President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, firmly in tow.
They were part of a pantheon of the biggest names in fashion that descended upon
Doha
last week, to mix with Qatari dignitaries and socialites and act as judges for the inaugural Fashion Trust Arabia prize. Twenty-four hours earlier, the same group — alongside the artist
Jeff Koons
and the soccer manager José Mourinho, as well as celebrities including Johnny Depp and Sonam Kapoor — had attended a star-spangled opening event for the new
National Museum of Qatar
, featuring Bedouin dancers, musicians, singers and flag-wielding horseback riders.
Few, if any, of the boldface names at these gatherings had ever been to Doha before
. Their en masse arrival, however, on the invitation of the ruling Al-Thani family, was an unmistakable demonstration of the unlikely influence of Qatar, a tiny Gulf state where vast natural gas resources were discovered almost 60 years ago, helping to make it the most wealthy country per capita in the world.
It was also the latest move in a cultural and architectural arms race raging in the Gulf. Rival nations that stem from the same Bedouin roots, share the same religion and eat the same food compete to establish distinctive national identities and status amid political volatility, colliding cultures and intense economic upheaval.
“Qatar is a very small but hugely wealthy state surrounded by countries that have long sought to minimize its potential to ascend as a major player in both the Arab region but also the greater world at large,” said Giorgio Cafiero, the chief executive of Gulf State Analytics, a Washington-based consultancy.
“Qatar’s investments — especially in luxury, sports and the arts — aren’t just about prestige and profits,” Mr. Cafiero said. “They are also about hearts and minds, and anchored in forging deep alliances that give outside players a greater stake in the continuation of Qatar as an independent state.”
The importance of shoring up soft power as part of a broader national security strategy has grown in importance for Qatar lately, as it faces the most serious external threat in its four-decade history. Since June 2017,
a land and sea blockade
led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and including Bahrain and Egypt, has cut the kingdom off from its neighbors.
Overnight, planes and cargo ships were diverted, all diplomatic links were cut, and Qatar’s sole land border, a 40-mile stretch of desert with Saudi Arabia, was closed. Even camels were not spared the politics: 12,000 Qatari animals were forcibly repatriated.
Riyadh and Abu Dhabi accused Qatar of supporting the Muslim Brotherhood, alongside other allegations, like
assisting some popular Islamist movements
that rose with the Arab Spring.
So far, however, their demands — from noninterference in neighboring states to closing the al-Jazeera media network — have fallen upon deaf ears. Instead, Qatar has painted the dispute as a drive by bullying neighbors to crush its
maverick, open-door foreign policy
.
“Isolation has, it seems, acted as a catalyst to Qatar’s long-term vision for itself,” said Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a fellow for the Middle East at the Baker Institute at Rice University.
Rather than being called to heel, the state scrambled to adapt to its new status quo. It has
invested in its military
, strengthened its alliance with Washington, shifted imports and shipping routes through countries like Turkey and Iran, and doubled down on its economic ties to global powers.
Few expect the blockade to end any time soon, and so diplomatic tensions remain uncomfortably high. Consequently, as Qatar prepares to host the
FIFA World Cup in 2022
, it has furthered efforts to bolster its standing overseas, the better to guarantee its long-term survival.
That said, spending unfathomable amounts of money beyond its own borders is a strategy the Qataris first embraced almost two decades ago. In a bid to diversify away from a carbon-based economy, Qatar has taken stakes in a wide variety of things, including the French soccer team Paris St. Germain and London’s Heathrow Airport, along with global finance, health care, technology and auto companies.
It has made major donations to universities, including Georgetown and Carnegie Mellon, building sister campuses across Doha, and developed a London property portfolio
larger than that of Queen Elizabeth II of Britain
, according to a report in
The Telegraph
. The jewel in that portfolio is the Shard, the tallest building in western Europe. And that is just the beginning.
In the art world, the buying power of the Qataris has —
until recently
— been essentially unmatched. It has been led by
Sheikha Al Mayassa Hamad bin Khalifa Al Than
i, the chair of Qatar Museums and sister of the emir, who holds an annual acquisitions budget estimated at $1 billion per year for blue-chip works.
In fashion, Mayhoola for Investments (its name means “unknown” in Arabic), a secretive state-backed conglomerate linked to
Sheikha Mozah bint Nasser Al-Missned
, a global style icon and mother of the emir, owns several luxury brands, including Valentino and Balmain.
Unsurprisingly, both brands emerged as major sponsors of the F.T.A. prize, which was founded by Sheikha Mozah; its co-chairs are Sheikha Al Mayassa and Tania Fares, a Lebanese philanthropist and British Vogue
contributing editor who
founded
the Fashion Trust in Britain.
Elsewhere, a string of sizable luxury investments has also been built up by the Qatar Investment Authority, the country’s sovereign wealth fund, from holdings in groups like LVMH to ownership of the upmarket British department store Harrods and luxury hotels like Claridge’s in London.
Such Qatari-owned trophy assets have been hard hit by the ripple effect of the blockade, however, with wealthy Saudi and Emirati patrons opting to shop or stay elsewhere. Social media users in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — possibly orchestrated by their governments — frequently encourage others to boycott companies with links to Qatar. An unofficial blacklist of places in London, where many Middle Eastern visitors spend the summer months to escape the heat back home, was
widely circulated online
last year.
It has not escaped the luxury industry that it may be a pawn in a geopolitical battle. “The severing of ties between Qatar and its neighbors is something many in the luxury industry have been paying close attention to,” said Alexander Bolen, the chief executive of the American fashion house Oscar de la Renta, which has a concession in Harrods and is sizing up expanding its retail footprint in the Gulf.
“The Middle East is home to a significant proportion of extremely valuable clients, who spend at home but also extensively abroad,” Mr. Bolen said. “It is not in our interests to alienate anyone.”
Many countries would have buckled under the type of restrictions imposed on Qatar by its larger and more powerful neighbors, but Qatar has refused to capitulate, albeit by spending heavily and dipping deeply into its $340 billion reserve funds to establish new trading partners, build up domestic industries and, in some cases, create new ones.
Nevertheless, the kingdom’s fledgling tourism industry has taken a hit, leaving hotel rooms empty and a glut of retail space in malls. At the same time, consumer prices have gone up, cutting into the budgets of the foreign workers who make up 88 percent of the country’s population of 2.4 million people.
Not that this has stopped Western brands from opening stores in Doha. Earlier this year, for example,
Ralph & Russo
, a couture house based in London, opened its biggest boutique in the world at the Lagoona Mall in Doha. Measuring more than 3,000 square feet, it is decorated in silver, alabaster, light beige and rose gold with a colossal mirrored Murano glass chandelier as a centerpiece.
“Sheikha Mozah discovered us, was hugely supportive of the business, and since then our relationship with our Qatari clientele has just been phenomenal,” said Michael Russo, the chief executive of Ralph & Russo. “They are a small but extremely valuable customer base for us, so it made total sense to ensure that we could offer them collections on their home turf.”
Mario Ortelli, a managing partner of the luxury consultancy Ortelli & Co., said that Qatar remained a niche but important market for luxury companies, with residents who have significant disposable income and a preference for European brands.
“The biggest impact of the embargo has been that rather than spending abroad, more and more of those Qataris are opting to spend at home, partly for reasons of practicality and partly through patriotism,” he said. “Even if things stay slower in the short-term, the expectation is that things will definitely pick up significantly ahead of major high-profile events such as the World Cup.”
Observers such as Mr. Cafiero of Gulf State Analytics and Dr. Coates Ulrichsen of the Baker Institute say it is the blockading countries, rather than Qatar, that have found themselves on the back foot in recent months.
While Qatar is hardly immune to international criticism, which has largely focused on evidence of
exploitation of its migrant workers
and government support for the Muslim Brotherhood, Saudi Arabia was publicly condemned across the West after the killing last fall of the dissident Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist who was ambushed and dismembered by Saudi agents in Istanbul.
The murder has
tarnished Saudi Arabia’s reputation
in Washington, and in much of the Western world, with a dark shadow cast over previously heralded plans for economic and social reform in the country, championed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom’s de facto ruler.
At the same time,
Dubai’s
economy is teetering on the brink of another downturn thanks to a shaky real estate market, its reputation as a sun-and-shopping haven dampened by sluggish travel demand in the region. The disappearance of Qatari wallets hasn’t helped.
“The biggest loser from the blockade is not Qatar, it is Dubai, where Qataris both spent a lot of money recreationally and used the city as a logistics hub. Now all that money is gone,” Mr. Cafiero said. “While the blockade initially hit the Qatari economy hard and officials had to spend billions of dollars restructuring trade routes, they appear to have done so in a relatively short period of time. It may have a very small population, but Qatar continues to hold very big ambitions.”
At the F.T.A. ceremony on March 28, there was little talk of the blockade — at least not publicly. Instead, the focus was on the winners. Each would receive industry mentorship, up to $200,000 in funding for their brands and be stocked internationally by
Matchesfashion.com
, a luxury e-commerce platform.
Two Lebanese women’s wear designers, Salim Azzam and Roni Helou, were jointly awarded the inaugural ready-to-wear prize; Krikor Jabotian, also from Lebanon, scooped up the evening wear accolade. Other awards went to the Egyptian bag brand Sabry Marouf, the Moroccan footwear label Zyne and the Lebanese jewelry brand Mukhi Sisters.
Hints that the game of influence transcended fashion and good intentions to verge on political calculation kept coming through. Of the 25 finalists whittled down from an initial 250 applicants, none came from Saudi Arabia, which hosted its
inaugural fashion week in Riyadh
last year.
A handful, however, came from Dubai and Egypt, with their participation warmly welcomed by Sheikha Al Mayassa during an interview in her office at the National Museum ahead of the event.
Later, from a lectern on the stage, she reiterated her hopes for the start of an emerging fashion industry in the Middle East that could transcend regional borders but be rooted in Qatar.
“Like other branches of the arts, fashion enables us to dream and express ourselves,” she said. “This prize will now anchor fashion as a major creative field in Qatar and across the Arab world.”
She acknowledged, as well, the complicated situation that was the backdrop for the festivities. “At the time this prize was conceived, political realities were different than they are today,” she said. “As a nation, we have remained open to applications from all countries. It is unfortunate that in this day and age, some individuals can hinder the course of progress and prosperity for millions of people without being held accountable for their whimsical and detrimental actions. We, on the other hand, have chosen not to follow suit.”

Delve into the books of the Mexican writer and musician Julián Herbert and how obedient — how
chaste —
so much contemporary nonfiction can suddenly seem in comparison. Does Herbert write memoirs? Essays? Novels? His books are mash-ups of memory, investigation and fictional ornamentation, marked with a fond disrespect for genre — much like life.
Herbert wrote his previous, prizewinning book, “Tomb Song,” in his mother’s hospital room, as she lay dying from leukemia. It is as much farce as elegy — his dreamy, druggy interludes vie with deathbed scenes and recollections of a childhood of poverty and abandonment, spent in the brothels where his mother worked, changing her name “with the nonchalance with which other women dye or perm their hair” — Lorena, Vicky, Juana. (The source, I’ve often thought, of Herbert’s comfort with the murk and multiplicity of truth.)
The title was a twist on “cradle song” — a lullaby. Herbert kept vigil over his mother in her final days, her “best-loved and most-hated son.” His new book, like the last, is translated by Christina MacSweeney — one of the great Spanish translators of her generation. It’s another kind of tomb song, this time for the motherland. “The House of the Pain of Others” tells the story of a “small genocide” that took place in the city of Torreón, over the course of three days in 1911, during the Mexican Revolution. Three hundred Chinese immigrants were shot and bludgeoned to death in the streets, their corpses mutilated, their belongings, businesses and homes ransacked.
The crime has had a strange afterlife. It has been misunderstood and misrepresented — many of Torreón’s inhabitants still blame outsiders, marauding revolutionaries and drug cartels (almost anyone, to avoid their own complicity). But it has never been truly forgotten. Oral and printed versions circulated almost immediately in its wake, and academic studies followed. The story of the massacre “wants to be told,” Herbert writes. “It refuses to die. This book is merely a version of that refusal.”
The challenge was to find a form. Herbert begins by describing the books he does not want to write: a conventional nonfiction narrative or a novel — the version of the killings that existed in popular imagination is fiction enough. “What didn’t exist was a
crónica
, in the hybrid Mexican sense of the term, with its blend of literature and journalism, objectivity and subjectivity. I decided to write an ambiguous story, a stylized cross section of history that would bring together the events of the past, and the dents they have left in the present (and in me),” he writes. He has created “a medieval book,” he tells us, his own efficient hype man. “A historical antinovel: overwriting: a stockpot with bony prefixes to season a greasy literary field that has run out of meat.”
I share your confusion. Not least because after the buildup (and garbled metaphors), what Herbert trundles out is fairly straightforward: a dense, detailed narrative of the massacre — although not without a few flourishes.
The book opens with an epigraph from “Chinatown” (the film’s classic line: “Forget it, Jake. It’s Chinatown”) and then a heading announcing, “This is a western.” Setting is fate, we are to understand — and Herbert implicates the entire society in the killings, its patrimony of violence, eugenics and amnesia. “Mexico is full of pits filled with the bodies of people who disappeared,” Herbert wrote in his short story “Z.” “A few years ago in Coahuila, a whole town disappeared: 300 people were found buried in a common grave. And none of these cases ever get solved.” Other stories of disappearances gather at the margins of this new book — 43 students who went missing in 2015; the repeated torching of historical archives.
The title of the book comes from the nickname of the local soccer stadium, and encapsulates, to Herbert, Mexico’s xenophobia. “Mexican anti-Chinese sentiment did not begin with the slaughter in Torreón, nor did it end with that event. Before the small genocide, the fantasy of annihilation had set up camp in the press, in coffeehouse conversations, jokes, laws, segregation, public demonstrations and vituperation until things came to blows.”
Or go back even further. Anti-Chinese sentiment seethed long before the arrival of the first immigrant in the Americas; it sprang up “from the thorny territory of the imagination,” nurtured by reports from spurned missionaries to China who concocted stories of “irremediable pagans, child murderers” that were enthusiastically taken up by American tabloids. “Sinophobia became a best seller.”
It’s the unearthed American connection to the massacre that is Herbert’s most interesting contribution. He’s a skittish reporter; more content to chat with taxi drivers than squeeze stories from his subjects. (In one deflating scene, he encounters one of the leaders of Torreón’s Chinese community who expertly sidesteps his questions.) But in combing through various rumors — that the Chinese opened fire first, that the murders were carried out by Pancho Villa and his men — he makes a powerful admonishment about familiar narratives about racism.
The dominant view of the massacre has been of a spontaneous explosion of violence fueled by working-class resentment of immigrants, the cheap labor they provided and their growing foothold in Mexico. Herbert argues the opposite case: It was Mexico’s upper classes who initially “adopted the anti-Chinese prejudice of the leading United States citizens of the day,” he argues, looking to editorials and chilling anti-immigration “satires.” Long before any labor-related grievances cropped up, it was “a middle-class phobia” — and contagion — that spread, stoked by the Mexican government.
The bodies of the 300 Chinese immigrants were dumped in mass graves or left to rot. There was no apology, no restitution — in fact, intimidation of the community only continued after the killings. The great strength of Herbert’s book, written with such shame and fury, is that it is not framed as epitaph but as dispatch from a live crime scene, attentive to the silences, the still seething resentments, relinquishing nothing to history.

KIEV — As a comedian, TV host and actor, Volodymyr Zelenskiy knows how to start a show with a bang. He proved that by beating all comers in the first round of Ukraine's presidential election.
As he plans for the grand finale, a runoff against President Petro Poroshenko on April 21, aides say he is sticking to an unorthodox campaign routine that has torn up the play book.
Appearing to turn the tables on Poroshenko, Zelenskiy on Wednesday evening accepted his challenge to take part in a policy debate. In a slick video with pumping music, he set his own conditions and gave his rival 24 hours to respond.
Poroshenko's campaign team had hinted Zelenskiy would duck out because the comedian, who plays a fictional president in a popular TV series, would risk showing himself up.
Within 45 minutes of Zelenskiy's video being posted on Facebook, it had been seen 141,000 times, shared more than 22,000 times and attracted 3,300 comments. It left a live countdown for Poroshenko to respond.
""You called me for a debate, dreaming that I would run away, duck out, hide. No. I'm not you in 2014,"" said Zelenskiy, in a reference to Poroshenko not holding a debate during the previous election five years ago.
Poroshenko responded with a much more sober video in which he accepted Zelenskiy's condition of holding the debate in a huge soccer stadium. But he cautioned: ""Debate is not a show ... This is no time to joke around. Being a president and commander in chief is not a game.""
Zelenskiy's response to Poroshenko offered a snapshot of how he has upstaged his more experienced rivals, winning nearly twice as many votes as Poroshenko in the first round of the election on March 31.
Shunning traditional campaign tactics such as mass rallies or erecting tents in the street to distribute leaflets, he has relied heavily on social media and comedy gigs where he pokes fun at rivals, presenting himself as an everyman who stands up to corrupt elites -- a man to whom Ukrainians can relate.
At stake is the leadership of a country on the frontline of the West's standoff with Russia following the 2014 annexation of the Crimea peninsula and war in eastern Ukraine against Russia-backed separatists in which 13,000 people have been killed.
""NOT AFRAID TO BE CREATIVE""
Part of Zelenskiy's campaign team works in a large house in an upscale area of the capital, Kiev. Inside, the offices have glass walls with messages scrawled on them and are filled with volunteers in their twenties bent over laptops.
""All that we do is to not be like everyone else,"" said 28-year-old Michael Fedorov, whose team manages various Facebook, YouTube and Instagram pages. ""We do not want to write typical posts. We do not want to speak the words that all politicians use. We want to get away from this as much as possible.""
He said Zelenskiy had from the start opposed traditional ways of doing things. ""As a result, we have one platform only – that's the internet,"" he said.
Zelenskiy invites suggestions from Facebook followers on tackling problems such as high utility bills or their choice of prime minister.
Dmytro Razumkov, Zelenskiy's political adviser, said the comedian would not hold mass rallies before the second vote because the focus was on ensuring he comes across as authentic and transparent.
""This is a person who is not a weather vane and does not change his position depending on whether it is more comfortable for a voter or less comfortable. You have to run for president, honestly stating your position and what will you do,"" he said.
One challenge is attracting voters who are not internet-savvy -- bridging the gap between online and offline.
Oleksandr Korniyenko, another senior member of Zelenskiy's team, said one technique to get around this was emailing voters with campaign messages and encouraging them to print out the email and distribute it.
Another was encouraging Zelenskiy's many young supporters to show his social media videos to older voters such as parents, he said.
Hoping a high turnout will favor Zelenskiy, his team is trying to ensure younger voters cast their ballots in email messages with headlines likely to make them click and read.
""Our emails are not the typical 'You joined such and such a political party'. Instead we might have a crazy headline,"" Fedorov said.
In the first round, an email was sent out by Zelenskiy's team with the subject line ""You've been left out"". The message itself said ""everyone has already voted except you"" and urged those who had voted to encourage others to vote, Fedorov said.
""We are not afraid to be creative,"" he said.
""NOT A JOKE""
Zelenskiy has 3.3 million followers on Instagram, more than French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Theresa May and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte combined. Poroshenko has 234,000.
The comedian's posts offer snapshots of his life such as working out in the gym or going for a run, and allow him to poke fun at his rivals' expense.
When former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who was eliminated in the first round of voting, posted a video of herself eating a hot dog at a popular gas station chain to show her common touch, Zelenskiy posted a picture of himself and his team eating a hotdog at the same chain.
""In order to not be considered as just a joke, we decided to be serious like everyone else,"" he wrote underneath.
Zelenskiy is likely to come under more scrutiny over policy before the runoff, including in the debate. He is wealthy and the image of the fictional president he plays, humble and scrupulously honest, is likely to be challenged by Poroshenko.
Zelenskiy has been accused during the campaign of being the puppet of a rich businessman whose TV channel airs his shows. Zelenskiy and the oligarch deny this, and both say their relationship is purely professional.
Razumkov says the campaign has shown Zelenskiy is his own man.
""In the Zelenskiy campaign, everything is completely different. When he launched his campaign, he said: 'I want to show how you can become president, but remain a human being.'""

NEW DELHI — It is the biggest election in history.
Across India, from the Himalayan mountains to the Andaman Islands in the Bay of Bengal, the first wave of millions of citizens started casting ballots Thursday in a five-week-long vote to choose a new Parliament, which will select a prime minister.
India is the world’s largest democracy, the most populous nation after China, and a pivotal geopolitical power. And it has never before held an election of this magnitude: 900 million eligible voters; at least 11 million poll workers; 2.3 million electronic voting machines; 2,000 political parties; and special trains, boats, helicopters and even elephants to transport voting equipment.
The race is a referendum on Narendra Modi, the powerful prime minister who is up for re-election. One of the most polarizing figures India has produced in decades, Mr. Modi has championed an assertive brand of Hindu nationalist politics that strives to elevate India’s Hindu identity but has sharply divided this country.
Many Indians appreciate his intensity, which he constantly demonstrates in huge rallies where hundreds of thousands of people gather under the hot sun to hear him thunder about being India’s watchman — his new campaign slogan — and how he is the best candidate to preside over this dizzyingly diverse nation of 1.3 billion.
On Thursday evening, the Election Commission of India said that the first phase of voting — which involved more than 140 million voters in 20 states and federal territories — had been free, fair and peaceful, and that in some places, turnout topped 80 percent.
But there were a number of complaints about malfunctioning voting machines, and opposition parties in a few areas said that security forces or poll workers had coerced people to vote for Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party.
Chaos erupted at one polling station
in the state of Andhra Pradesh when supporters of rival parties attacked each other. At least one man was killed.
At the Merry Angels Public School just outside the capital, New Delhi, the vast majority of more than a dozen voters interviewed on Thursday morning said they had voted for Mr. Modi’s party.
“I’m not even that happy with Modi,” said Vikas Kumar Sau, a rickshaw driver who complained about slum housing and police harassment. “But everyone else was voting for him, so I thought I might as well too.”
The voters moved through long lines to have their identification cards checked and then stepped into cardboard voting booths, where they pushed a button on a long tablet that showed the candidates’ names, photographs and party symbols, which varied from a flower and soccer ball to a pair of scissors. All this unfolded quietly. The loudest sound was the electronic ding after each vote was cast.
A large number of Indians believe that the Modi administration has been more effective, less corrupt and better at positioning India on the world stage than past governments.
But his party has also alienated minorities and created fear. Intellectuals blame the Hindu nationalist atmosphere stoked by Mr. Modi and the party for a rash of lynchings and other violence against Muslims and lower-caste Indians.
The latest surveys predict that Mr. Modi, 68, will return to power. But voter discontent over India’s economic challenges, especially rising joblessness, is likely to reduce the number of parliamentary seats his party controls. That could hamper his ability to push the Hindu nationalist agenda further.
How does the election work? Will Modi win? What are the main issues facing India and its 900 million voters?
In the last election, in 2014, Mr. Modi’s party stunned the country by winning an outright majority in the lower house of Parliament, which has 543 elected seats. By picking up even more seats through alliances with smaller parties, he then built a political juggernaut that went on to dominate Indian politics.
But this time around, few expect such a tidal wave. Though Mr. Modi remains popular among many in the middle class and across northern India’s Hindu heartland, more poor Indians are turning against him.
Farmers in many states have organized protests, furious that Mr. Modi has not delivered on promises to strengthen crop prices. In urban areas, anti-Modi feelings are building as well. Rising inflation and unemployment have become liabilities for him.
India’s economy is still growing at a fast rate, around 7 percent a year. Technology companies are popping up across the landscape; passenger jets are almost always packed; and more Indian students are attending the world’s best universities. India now is the sixth-largest economy, powered by its sheer scale.
But many gains have been captured by a tiny elite. Poverty lurks in every corner of this country, from New Delhi’s busiest intersections to the sharecropper cotton farms across central India.
This leaves the leading opposition party, the center-left Indian National Congress, an opportunity to capture more seats than in the last election, which it lost badly. But most polling data suggests Congress will be a distant second to Mr. Modi’s, with slim prospects of forming the next government.
Several voters at the polling station outside New Delhi grumbled that Congress hadn’t done much for India in all its years in power. A few said they voted for neither Congress nor the B.J.P. but for “the elephant,” the symbol of the Bahujan Samaj Party, a party formed by members of lower castes.
The biggest criticism of Congress, which won India freedom from Britain and ruled for most of India’s independent history, is that it has failed to articulate a clear vision. The party historically has championed minority rights. Its socialist policies have helped improve education and empower lower castes.
But as Mr. Modi’s party has pulled India rightward, the Congress party has struggled to respond.
Rasheed Kidwai, author of several books on the Congress party, said it lacked “that kind of hunger for power that the B.J.P. has.”
The party also cannot shake its reputation as a family dynasty, embodied by its leader, Rahul Gandhi.
Mr. Gandhi’s father was prime minister. So were his grandmother and great-grandfather.
But Mr. Gandhi, 48, has never displayed his ancestors’ zest for politics. He is known as affable, mild-mannered, even a little shy, and if this race were purely a choice between him and Mr. Modi, opinion polls show he would be trounced.
But Indian politics are not personality pageants. The race for prime minister is actually 543 different parliamentary races, often driven by complex local issues and contested by a galaxy of parties that fight along geographic, religious and caste lines. Bribes are rampant; the election commission has already seized billions of rupees and millions of liters of liquor.
The election results will not be clear for a while, since the voting is conducted through mid-May. Different places vote on different dates, and the electronic machines — and the poll workers — will move from site to site.
Only after the last votes have been cast will the election commission reveal the results, expected on May 23.

Good morning.

In recent years, journalists and advocates have tried to capture the scope of the Bay Area’s homelessness crisis — a problem that often feels unfathomable in its
depth and complexity
.
Still, much of the discussion has centered on San Francisco, or on the efforts of individual cities throughout the region.
[
Read about a debate over a homeless services center proposed for a waterfront location in San Francisco.
]
Today, the
Bay Area Council Economic Institute
, the think-tank arm of a business group, is set to release a report that examines the issue through a regional lens.
“One of the things about the Bay Area is, it’s a wonderful place, but it’s very divided up,” Jim Wunderman, the council’s president and chief executive, told me. “We have
101 cities in nine counties
around this very large bay and there’s no one city that dominates the landscape.”
But that isn’t how programs aimed at moving people into housing have been implemented, he said, even as more people in smaller suburbs find themselves in tenuous housing situations, and more people live out of their cars, which means they’re mobile.
The group wanted to explore ways to scale up successful programs and boost coordination among communities. To do that, Mr. Wunderman said, the group needed to better understand what was at stake.
The report
found:
• Roughly
28,200 people
were homeless across the Bay Area, according to point-in-time counts in 2017. That was the third largest population in the country, after New York (
76,500
) and Los Angeles (
55,200
). The next largest overall number was
11,600
in Seattle and King County.
• But the Bay Area has a relatively large percentage of homeless people without shelter (indicating there’s a shortage of subsidized housing, short-term shelters and transitional housing). That was
67 percent.
That’s compared with just
5 percent in New York
and
47 percent in Seattle and King County
. Once again, though, Los Angeles had the largest percentage of unsheltered homeless people:
75 percent.
• The analysis found that spending on services for people experiencing homelessness or people who were at risk varied widely across the region. Part of that stems from the fact that the costs to build vary widely.
For instance, the report said, building new permanently supportive housing costs
$730,560 on average per unit
in San Francisco County
, compared with
$393,580 per unit
on average in Solano County
.
However, Mr. Wunderman said that particular finding shouldn’t be taken as a sign that services, housing and emergency shelter should be concentrated in the least expensive parts of the Bay.
“We’re going to continue to need to develop programs locally,” he said. “I think this is a burden that has to be shouldered by everyone.”
Mr. Wunderman suggested one way to persuade communities to do their part: Tie state money to initiatives.

WARSAW — Growing up in a small city in southern Poland, part of a religious family and conservative community, Maciej Gosniowski was told again and again that something was wrong with him.
“It would be better if I changed myself,” he recalled teachers telling him. “It would be better if I behaved more like a boy. It would make my life easier.”
Mr. Gosniowski was beaten by other students who used homophobic slurs he did not yet understand. He does not want other young people to suffer as he did, so he welcomed the decision by the mayor of Warsaw to introduce a declaration last month aimed at promoting tolerance.
But the backlash to the declaration has left him shaken.
Poland’s governing party, Law and Justice, has seized on the declaration and the issue of gay rights in its campaigning for European Union elections in May and for national elections this fall.
Where the party once
attacked migrants
as a threat to the soul of the country, gay people have become its public enemy No. 1 in recent weeks.
It is part of a growing trend across eastern and central Europe, where nationalist and populist parties are increasingly turning to cultural issues — and attacks on gay people — to rally their faithful.
From Romania, where the government
tried and failed to change the Constitution
to ban same-sex marriage, to Hungary, where homosexuals are vilified as
a threat to traditional families
, the letters L.G.B.T. are being scorned as part of a broader struggle against what the nationalists and populists call “European values.”
Jaroslaw Kaczynski
, the leader of Law and Justice and the most powerful politician in Poland, used the party’s convention in March to declare that this was a war Poland must win to survive.
“It comes down to, as we know today, sexualization of children from the earliest childhood,” he said. “We need to fight this. We need to defend the Polish family. We need to defend it furiously because it’s a threat to civilization, not just for Poland but for the entire Europe, for the entire civilization that is based on Christianity.”
The party’s rank and file have rallied to the call.
“I think that Poland will be a region free from L.G.B.T.,” said Elzbieta Kruk, who is running on the party’s list for a seat in the European Parliament. “I hope it will be.”
Other groups have echoed the attacks, often in more extreme language.
Fans of one of the country’s most popular soccer clubs,
Legia Warsaw
, unfurled a banner during a match last month that used a homophobic slur. No action was taken during the match. The club later said that it did not wish to be brought into “political and ideological fights” and that the banner “did not reflect Legia’s views.”
Leading Polish figures in the Roman Catholic Church, itself reeling from
revelations about sexual abuse by priests
, have also joined in.
The Rev. Marek Dziewiecki, a well-known Catholic priest and educator, told a local radio station in a recent interview that the plus in “L.G.B.T.Q.+” stood for “pedophiles, zoophiles, necrophiles,” and that the ultimate goal was to “make people into infertile erotomaniacs.”
When some 1,500 supporters of far-right groups came to Czestochowa, Poland’s holiest site, this month, the Rev. Henryk Grzadko warned those gathered that Poland was experiencing a “civilizational invasion.”
“It comes down to them waving a rainbow flag and trying to steal our internal values like truth, love, human life, family based on marriage, and morality based on Gospel and Decalogue,” he said during his homily at a Mass for the gathering.
Rafal Trzaskowski
, the mayor of Warsaw, who issued the tolerance declaration, said that while he had expected a cynical response from the government, he worried about the sort of propaganda state outlets had produced.
It was the same kind of bile, he said, that led a man to fatally stab the mayor of Gdansk,
Pawel Adamowicz
, on live television this year.
“They are basing their policy on fear,” he said in an interview at his City Hall office. “They started a few years back with refugees when they painted this abysmal picture that we are going to be overrun by hundreds of thousands of migrants that are going to rape our women and introduce diseases into Poland. They are now doing exactly the same thing.”
But he does not think it will work. In 2015, when Law and Justice came to power, an overwhelming majority of Poles agreed with the idea that more needed to be done to secure Europe’s borders from migrants.
That threat has largely passed, and the issue does not have the resonance it once did, according to a poll released this week by the European Council on Foreign Relations.
“While migration is important for some voters, it is not the only battleground for votes ahead of the European Parliament elections,” the group said in a statement.
Mr. Trzaskowski, the Warsaw mayor, said he did not believe attacking gay people would prove as effective as the campaign against migrants.
“The majority of the Polish people will not buy the idea that homosexuals endanger our culture or values,” he said.
An openly gay candidate, Robert Biedron, formed a new liberal party and has found widespread support for his message, including outside urban centers.
A recent public opinion poll conducted by Ipsos for the news outlet OKO.Press found that 56 percent of Poles did not oppose civil partnerships; two years ago, it was 52 percent.
At the same time, though, Poles remain steadfastly opposed to adoption by gay couples, with only 18 percent support.
Oktawiusz Chrzanowski, 36, who played a key role in helping draft the Warsaw declaration, and his partner, Hubert Sobecki, said one of the most insidious parts of the government campaign was an effort to paint homosexuality as a danger to children.
“The most shocking and disgusting thing is how they can claim people in the L.G.B.T. community are pedophiles,” Mr. Sobecki said.
The Warsaw declaration calls for sex education in schools that follows guidelines set out by the World Health Organization, and for a shelter in the city for people cast out by their family and community.
Mr. Chrzanowski said he hoped that one day soon all schools would have a “lighthouse keeper,” someone students could turn to for advice without fear of judgment.
Mr. Gosniowski, who decided to come out not long after he was beaten in high school and works as one of only a handful of drag performers in the country, said he was now confident in his sexuality.
At lunch recently at a Warsaw cafe, he wore a pink sweatshirt and big gold hoop earrings under his long blond hair — a definite style statement in a country where nonconformity can still come at a cost.
Young people often ask him about coming out safely.
“I feel I am needed here,” he said. “People here are scared to walk hand in hand in the street.”
While the vitriol being directed at gays is alarming, he said, he has also noticed an outpouring of support that surprised him.
“The two wings of society seem to be spreading apart,” he said. “I have found more support than ever. But also people who are more hateful than ever.”
An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misspelled the surname of the mayor of Gdansk, who was stabbed and killed earlier this year. His name was Pawel Adamowicz, not Adamkiewicz.

(Reuters) - Burnley defender Phil Bardsley could miss Saturday's Premier League match against Cardiff City after sustaining a freak leg injury while playing head tennis with his team mates, manager Sean Dyche said on Thursday.
Bardsley suffered a cut to his leg after striking the edge of a table during the game in training, forcing him out of last Saturday's 3-1 victory at Bournemouth and leaving him in doubt for their next league match.
""He's touch and go,"" Dyche told a news conference.
""They were messing around on a head tennis game and he caught the edge of the table and unfortunately cut his leg quite badly. We'll make a decision on him probably tomorrow.
""The modern table is a very fine bit of equipment but just misused on this occasion by accident but I'm not remotely questioning the equipment.""
Defender Matt Lowton, who stepped in against Bournemouth to make his 100th appearance for the club, could feature again if Bardsley is unavailable.
Striker Peter Crouch will miss the clash as he recovers from appendix surgery.
Dyche was hopeful winger Aaron Lennon could play again this season after a knee operation in December.
Burnley are 14th in the standings with 36 points from 33 games, four places and eight points above 18th-placed Cardiff.

RIO DE JANEIRO — The 2020 Copa America will mark a tournament revamp, with six teams beginning the campaign in a north zone in Colombia and six playing in a south zone in co-hosts Argentina, the South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL) said on Wednesday.
Argentina will be in the southern group, alongside Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia and an as yet undisclosed guest.
Brazil will feature in the northern group with Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru and another invited nation.
The teams will play each other once in their groups, and the top four sides in each group will then qualify for the quarter-finals. The final is to be played in Argentina.
The changes are part of a widespread attempt to revitalize South American club and international competitions and bring them more into line with Europe.
CONMEBOL have abandoned their six-decades long tradition of playing the Copa Libertadores final on a home-and-away basis, and will this year play the final at a neutral ground for the first time, much like the Champions League.
Next year's Copa America will be the fourth in six years. Officials want the tournament to be played at the same time as the European Championship, Europe's equivalent.

NICOSIA — The Cyprus Football Association (CFA) has postponed this weekend's second division fixtures following warnings from UEFA regarding suspected match-fixing.
The CFA board of directors will meet next Tuesday to examine rule changes to stamp out any perceived corruption, including a points deduction, relegation or removal of a team found to be guilty of match-fixing.
It is also considering halving the number of teams in the division from 16 to eight for the 2019-20 season.
The CFA received a number of warning letters from the European game's ruling body concerning second division fixtures. Four of those matches are being investigated by the police, the Cyprus Mail newspaper reported.

AMSTERDAM — Ajax Amsterdam believe they are still very much alive in the Champions League even though they were held to a 1-1 home draw by Juventus in Wednesday's first leg of their quarter-final tie.
Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo had given the Italian side a halftime lead only for David Neres to equalise 30 seconds after the restart.
""A 1-1 draw in a home game is not exactly what we were hoping for, but it is still a good result,"" said Ajax coach Erik ten Hag.
""The last time we lost 2-1 at home to Real Madrid, so everything is still alive for us.""
Ajax eliminated holders Real in the last 16 with a 4-1 away triumph in the second leg, after being beaten at home, and the Dutch club will be seeking another upset in Turin next Tuesday.
""We have a team with much potential and we are showing that in the Champions League. It's not for nothing we have made it to the quarter-finals,"" added captain Matthijs de Ligt.
""In the return we'll have to give everything because Juventus are incredibly difficult.""
Ten Hag praised his team's showing, even though Ajax did not create many clear-cut goalscoring opportunities.
""In a lot of the phases of the game, we were better,"" he said. ""We were excellent in our transitions onto attack. Juventus found it hard to apply pressure on us because we kept the ball, we were patient and created chances.""
But he conceded the visitors were always going to be dangerous, spurred on by the 34-year-old Ronaldo, who scored a 125th Champions League goal with characteristic brilliance.
""If you make a mistake they are quick to pounce on it. You saw that with the goal of Cristiano Ronaldo. Even if you are running with him and tracking back, he is incredibly quick,"" added the Ajax coach.

(Reuters) - Chelsea midfielder Danny Drinkwater has no future at the Premier League club because he is not suited to their style of play, manager Maurizio Sarri said on Wednesday.
Drinkwater joined Chelsea from Leicester City for a reported 35 million pounds in 2017 but last played for the London club in the Community Shield in August.
The midfielder was charged with drink driving earlier this week and was left out of Chelsea's squad for their trip to face Slavia Prague in the Europa League quarter-finals later on Thursday.
""(Drinkwater) has never played because... he's not suitable to my system, to my way of playing,"" Sarri told reporters.
""Maybe I'm wrong, but it's my opinion. I spoke with him in August, when the market was still open, and said he should look for something different because he wouldn't play. And I told him the reasons, my reasons.
""I don't know (why he decided to stay). Probably he hoped we could change the system. I have a very good relationship with him because, in my opinion, he's a good boy... but he's not suitable for me.""
Sarri plans to make five or six changes for the Europa League match and says his side will need to be on their toes to get a result.
""In my opinion, this is a very dangerous match for us,"" he added. Slavia are a fast team, so we need to be very, very compact and defend really very well.
""They are dangerous, especially on crosses where they attack the box with five or six players, and are dangerous on counter-attacks. So it won't be easy for us.""

MILAN — Fiorentina coach Stefano Pioli resigned on Tuesday, less than 24 hours after the Serie A club had said his job was safe, and said that his professional and human qualities had been called into question.
Fiorentina have dropped to tenth in the Serie A after winning only one out of their last 11 matches in all competitions and suffered a shock 1-0 defeat at home by next-to-bottom Frosinone on Sunday.
However, they have reached the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia and drew their first leg 3-3 at home to Atalanta.
On Monday, the club issued a statement strongly criticising the team's recent performances but said it wanted Pioli, in charge for one year and 10 months, to lead the recovery.
""The owners are absolutely not prepared to accept what has been happening for the last few months,"" it said
""The team must go back to being what it was: competitive, courageous and proud of the shirt they are wearing.""
The club then asked Pioli to ""handle this situation with the competence and seriousness he showed in the first half of the championship.""
On Tuesday, Fiorentina said in a short statement that it had received Pioli's resignation while the coach told the ANSA news agency that he had been ""reluctantly forced to leave.""
""I have always assumed my responsibilities, I have always guaranteed professionalism, respect and maximum commitment in my work,"" he said.
""Today, I reluctantly see myself forced to leave, resigning, as my professional and above all human abilities have been questioned.""
Pioli, coaching his 12th Italian team, had been nurturing a young team around players such as forwards Giovanni Simeone (23) and Federico Chiesa (21) and goalkeeper Alban Lafont (20).
Fiorentina routinely finish in the top half of Serie A although they have not won a trophy since the Coppa Italia in 2001 and the last of their two league titles was in 1969.
They showed all their potential in thrashing AS Roma 7-1 in a Coppa Italia quarter-final in January but since then, the team's form has dropped.

MANCHESTER, England — Barcelona defender Gerard Pique has urged his side to make sure they do not leave Manchester United room for another heroic comeback in the Champions League when they visit Old Trafford in Wednesday's eagerly-awaited quarter-final first leg.
United made history in the last-16 by overturning a 2-0 home defeat against Paris St Germain to win the tie on away goals with a dramatic 3-1 victory in the French capital, underlining the club's reputation for stirring European revivals.
""The PSG game should serve as an example for us that you cannot afford to leave Manchester United alive, if you can beat them with lots of goals then you have to do it,"" Pique told a news conference on Tuesday.
""In the first leg PSG were the better side, they scored two goals and they could have scored more. United have a great history, in the second leg they played with lots of young lads from their academy and they still qualified.
""That game should remind us that we have to be very concentrated, as United are a very dangerous team.""
Pique, 32, spent his first years as a professional with United, joining the club aged 17 but returning to Barca in 2008 after failing to hold down a place in the team due to fierce competition from Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic.
Pique has turned into one of Barcelona's best ever defenders in his 11 years back at his boyhood club and is on course to win an eighth La Liga title with the Catalans, who are also in the Copa del Rey final and have the treble within their sights.
But he said his experience at United was invaluable to his development.
""I went from being kid to an adult here, I had my first experiences as a professional and some crazy experiences off the pitch. I came here alone, without my family, I learned a lot and I left a completely different person,"" he recalled.
Pique also said United coach Ole Gunnar Solskjaer helped him through difficult times in Manchester when they were team mates, and he praised the former Norway forward for reviving the club's fortunes since succeeding Jose Mourinho in December.
""I remember Ole as a great team mate, I was 17 and he was a veteran and for sure he helped me adapt to the club, to the country and to the city,"" Pique added.
""It was a great experience to train alongside him, he helped me a lot so I'm happy to see him in charge of Manchester United. He's done a great job, won lots of games and got them playing much better. Tomorrow will be tough and I hope we can win.""
Barcelona said later on Tuesday that Ousmane Dembele was fit after he missed the previous four games with a hamstring injury.
The Frenchman has not played since Barca's 5-1 last-16 second-leg victory at home to Olympique Lyonnais on March 13.

LONDON — Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola remained unruffled despite his side's surprise 1-0 defeat by Tottenham Hotspur in their Champions League quarter-final, first leg tie on Tuesday.
City had lost only once in their past 23 matches in all competitions, a run that had seen them lift the League Cup, reach the FA Cup final and trade top spot in the Premier League with Liverpool in a thrilling title race.
They controlled large periods of the game against Tottenham, but looked vulnerable to the counter-attack and their usual slick passing occasionally seemed laboured.
The quadruple remains possible but City will have to keep alive their European hopes the hard way -- having not overturned a tie in which they have lost an away first leg since 1971.
They lost 3-0 at Liverpool in the first leg of last season's quarter-final so City's task is less daunting this time.
""Last season was much worse,"" Guardiola told reporters. ""Except for a few chances we conceded in set-pieces and some counter-attacks, we controlled the game and played quite well.
""I would have liked us to score a goal but the situation is what it is.""
City's cause was not helped by Sergio Aguero's first-half penalty miss after Danny Rose was harshly adjudged by VAR to have used his arm to block Raheem Sterling's shot.
Despite plenty of incursions deep into Tottenham territory, City managed only two shots on target as an attack that put 10 goals past Schalke in the last round misfired.
City also laboured somewhat to beat Brighton & Hove Albion in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley on Saturday, but Guardiola was not about to start criticising his team.
""When we don't play well I say it, but I don't have that feeling,"" said the Spaniard. ""They're a team who press a lot but they couldn't do that -- especially in the second half, when we arrived many times in the final third.
""We played so well on the second ball. Next week, hopefully our fans can support us every single minute.""

LIVERPOOL, England — Goals from Naby Keita and Roberto Firmino earned Liverpool a 2-0 win over Porto on Tuesday as Juergen Klopp's side took the upper hand in their Champions League quarter-final tie without killing off their Portuguese opponents.
There remains plenty of work to do for the Premier League leaders, who will be disappointed they were unable to gain a bigger advantage for next week's second leg.
On a bitterly cold night at Anfield, Liverpool were well below their best and Porto deserve credit for a determined performance after going two goals down in 26 minutes.
""We lost a little bit of direction in the second half, but there's nothing to criticise, 2-0 is a very, very good result,"" said Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp.
""We knew we had to play the second game and we cannot decide the tie tonight, so now we have to go there and fight again,"" he added.
The visitors fired an early warning shot with Moussa Marega blasting narrowly wide in the second minute but the home side took the lead three minutes later through a Keita shot which deflected off Porto midfielder Oliver Torres and beat the helpless Iker Casillas.
Mohamed Salah then forced Casillas into a low save with a sharp shot on the turn, but the Egyptian should have done better in the 22nd minute when he placed the ball wide when through on goal, after being played in by a sloppy Porto pass.
Liverpool had their second four minutes later -- Jordan Henderson split the Porto defence with a superb pass to Trent Alexander-Arnold, whose low cross was tapped in from close range by Firmino
The Brazilian should have added to his tally, but blasted over after a good cross from Henderson, who was again enjoying a more advanced midfield role.
Porto though showed they were not about to roll over -- the dangerous Marega had a low drive well saved by the legs of Liverpool keeper Alisson Becker.
The visitors also felt they should have had a penalty when the ball struck Alexander-Arnold's arm as he shepherded it out but after a VAR review the appeal was rejected.
Sadio Mane had an effort ruled out for offside three minutes after the interval, but apart from another Marega chance in the 69th minute there were few clear-cut opportunities in the second half.
The Portuguese side fought well to stay in the game in a scrappy second half to give themselves a chance of a comeback at home in next week's second leg.
They will, however, be angered when they see television replays of Salah's over the top, raised studs challenge on Porto's Danilo Pereira five minutes from the end for which he could easily have been dismissed.
Although Spanish referee Antonio Mateu Lahoz gave a foul Salah did not even receive a yellow card.

(Reuters) - Crystal Palace winger Andros Townsend has hailed Tottenham Hotspur full back Danny Rose's bravery for speaking out against racism and urged more players to join calls for the game's authorities to take more decisive action on racist abuse.
England international Rose said last week that he could not wait to leave football because he had had enough of the racism in the game and was frustrated by the response of the authorities to the abuse.
""Danny's a very brave man for coming out, being so honest and speaking the truth. Obviously I sympathise with him; we all support him,"" Townsend told reporters after Palace beat Newcastle United 1-0 in the Premier League on Saturday.
""Luckily, so far, I haven't experienced racism but I know Danny has on more than one occasion. He's experienced it with the England Under-21s and the seniors in Montenegro the other day.
""We need more players like Danny to come out, be honest and speak the truth, to say what they really feel. Danny's an incredible person; hopefully the system can help Danny and he can enjoy his football again.""
Juventus teenager Moise Kean also appeared to suffer racist abuse from the stands in a match at Cagliari in Serie A last week and there were more incidents in England this weekend.
Second-tier Wigan Athletic released a statement in support of Nathan Byrne after the defender was sent an abusive message on Twitter on Saturday, while Brentford confirmed a fan had been arrested at their ground for a racially-aggravated offence.
""Racism's crept back into our game a little bit, which is not great so we need Danny and the young lad at Juventus (Kean) to speak out because that will force action,"" Townsend added.
""I don't know why racism's still going on. We've got to move on in football and kick it out as much as we can. Hopefully the relevant organisations will do their best to stamp it out... They're working their very hardest to stamp it out once and for all.""

BURNLEY, England — There are instances in a club's history that can transform the mood and break barriers and as Manchester United prepare to face Barcelona in Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final, the class of 2019 were reminded about one such breakthrough moment.
Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's assistant Mike Phelan was part of the United team which beat Barca in the 1991 European Cup Winners' Cup -- ending a 23-year wait for a second European title after their famous European Cup win in 1968.
It was just the second trophy won by manager Alex Ferguson at United following the FA Cup triumph the previous season and the biggest prize since their last English league title in 1967.
In beating the Spanish giants in Rotterdam, thanks to two goals from Welsh striker Mark Hughes, United were suddenly back in the big time.
""It was a great occasion, the excitement and preparation that went into that as a player and then getting over to Rotterdam and preparing to play what were the favourites at that time, Barcelona with Johann Cruyff as manager,"" Phelan told Reuters in an interview.
Barca had the great Dutch defensive midfielder Ronald Koeman and the brilliant Danish forward Michael Laudrup, to compliment their Spanish core, including striker Julio Salinas.
But United, overwhelmingly English with a sprinkling of Welsh, Irish and Scottish talent, triumphed thanks to the goals of the former Barca striker Hughes.
""The game is like a blip but it is the time before and after the game that I remember,"" says Phelan who recalls the massive following of United fans in the Dutch city and the strong characters in Ferguson's dressing room.
The likes of Bryan Robson, Steve Bruce, Gary Pallister, Paul Ince, Clayton Blackmore and Brian McClair made up a team that was the true start of the Ferguson era.
""We knew we had created another moment in history for the club – it was terrific. It was also a push towards better things – it gave us a hunger to know that we could compete again at that level and we definitely moved into another territory where we continually won things,"" he said.
WONDERFUL STRIKE
Indeed, United were soon dominating English football and that success was to bring them up against Barca again in European competition.
Phelan was on the coaching staff in 2008, when United won a cagey, tactical two-legged Champions League semi-final encounter with Barca thanks to a wonderful strike from distance by Paul Scholes in the second leg at Old Trafford.
That set up the victory over Chelsea, on penalties, in the final in Moscow, as United won their second Champions League under Ferguson, following their memorable 1999 triumph against Bayern Munich -- at Barca's Nou Camp stadium.
But there are less positive memories from the two most recent clashes with the Spanish club -- a 2-0 defeat in the 2009 final and a 3-1 reverse in the 2011 decider when Pep Guardiola's former side again dominated.
""I think they were the best team in football at that time and led by an extremely good, up and coming coach, who has gone on to do even better,"" said Phelan.
""We were well beat, we had to take that on the chin. You try to be competitive – but our best wasn’t good enough,"" he added.
Barca are again favourites to reach the last four but Solksjaer's side have already shown, in the previous round, that they can overcome the odds.
United came back from 2-0 down to beat Paris St Germain after the first-leg to go through with a thrilling 3-1 win in the French capital and Phelan knows the team will have to repeat many of the qualities they showed in that game.
“We felt if anyone could do it – Manchester United could. The players embraced the whole thing. It was a real good feeling after the game, to know that the belief was there and that Manchester United can still create these moments,"" said Phelan.
""We got the reaction from the fans and the media which was great – it has gone down as a great night in football. Hopefully we can bottle it.
""With Ole and this new mindset we can produce some terrific performances.""
Standing in their way is Lionel Messi -- a goalscorer in both those lost finals.
""He is now more mature than he has ever been and he is still doing the things that he is really good at,"" said Phelan.
