democrats hoping president trump federal tax returns serve rosetta stone unlock secrets murky finances
trump hand spent past years refusing divulge returns even dismissing boring
fight whether members congress right see president tax returns intensifying house committee demanded
late wednesday treasury secretary steven mnuchin department comply request date set committee
earlier trump repeated disclose returns falsely claiming law gives congress authority obtain
trump president decades publicly release tax returns refusal coupled continued ownership network closely held businesses fanned suspicions something hide
might lawmakers find obtain trump tax filings
starters recent returns illuminate sources income strategies may used fully decode family personal business finances
leaked pages president old tax returns financial documents already shed light finances indicate trump likely
avoided paying income taxes
number years periods york
participated fraudulent tax schemes
minimize tax bill federal ethics filings show hundreds millions dollars outstanding loans business network owned web corporate entities
house ways means committee week requested six years trump personal tax returns along returns filed trusts seven subsidiaries controls asked records audits
returns partly reveal sources president income whether businesses profitable show much anything trump paying taxes might show whether aggressive reducing tax bills show whether trump personally donated charity
returns requested committee however fully answer longstanding questions identities trump business partners ultimate sources income whether entangled entities interests administration
even representative richard neal democrat massachusetts leads committee successful mean tax returns become public law supposed remain solely hands committee unauthorized release felony
update house chairman says treasury
reasons withhold trump tax returns
lack merit
ever declared candidacy trump billionaire faced questions whether exaggerating wealth
trump never substantiated assertion billionaire though
repeatedly claim
banks institutions disclosure tax returns probably settle debate trump net worth
tax returns provide lists assets liabilities unless generate income deductions even returns likely provide values assets liabilities
still trump full tax returns personal returns ones components trump organization give sense profitability businesses
returns reveal whether companies taken hit entered white house trump
lost vast amounts money
became president
trump years ran trump organization privately held company manages real estate golf resorts brand licensing deals interests much businesses finances remains unknown
federal ethics disclosures trump holdings far limited example requirement report identities investors put money businesses
trump acquired many properties particular golf courses cash cash come trump son eric told journalist trump organization golf properties paid russian money eric trump denied making statement
trump federal filings reported outstanding loans investments income business include debts partial interest older loans paid theory existence older loans lenders behind disclosed historical tax returns certain types interest debts
reality much information unlikely contained limited number returns requested congress panel seeking returns small number trump companies controls hundreds separate contain individual businesses varied particular building rights license name overseas businesses may file tax return separate ones requested committee
trump owns operates businesses united states overseas earns revenue golf club memberships leasing space buildings licensing deals put trump name developers properties
trump disclosure reports show ranges much revenue various subsidiaries collect provided trump indicate companies overall profitability
example recent ethics report states irish golf business reported revenue million however irish regulators require golf subsidiary filings public disclosures show business actually lost million trump returns provide detail profitability businesses broadly tax returns compared ethics disclosures check accuracy filings
trump personal tax returns itemize transactions institutions receiving income domestic foreign include income received banks
democrats trump taxes looking aggressive illegal maneuvers
