      "CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — The summer of 2015 found the University of North Carolina in what some, including Jay M. Smith, a professor at the university, would characterize as a curious position.\n",
      "A year earlier, a university-commissioned report had found that the African and Afro-American Studies Department had offered\n",
      "nearly 200 fraudulent classes\n",
      "over almost two decades. These classes had been disproportionately populated by athletes in the high-profile sports of football and basketball, who in some cases were steered by athletic department tutors who knew the courses required little work.\n",
      "The result was one of the worst academic scandals in college sports history, and a huge black mark on a prestigious university and its proud athletic program. The university’s accreditation body placed North Carolina on probation. The N.C.A.A. conducted an investigation.\n",
      "But critics saw few systemic changes.\n",
      "“There’d been none of these public forums, no signs of lessons learned,” Smith said recently.\n",
      "A\n",
      "history professor\n",
      "whose area of study is pre-Revolutionary France, Smith had been agitating about the scandal for several years. He had even written a book about the affair, “Cheated,” with a former learning specialist who helped blow the whistle on the classes.\n",
      "“I thought, I cannot rely on this institution to do the right thing,” Smith said, “and I think it would be an abdication of responsibility for us to pass up the opportunity to provide students at this institution an opportunity to learn about their scandal — how it happened, what it says about college sports, what it tells us about the plight of athletes.”\n",
      "And that is why earlier this week, as the men’s college basketball world turned its attention to the Final Four — an event the Tar Heels qualified for in 2016 and 2017, winning the title in the latter year — well over 100 undergraduates heard Smith lecture on the scandal as part of his increasingly popular course, History 383: Big-Time College Sports and the Rights of Athletes, 1874 to the Present.\n",
      "Students in the class read “Cheated” and “Pay for Play: A History of Big-Time College Athletic Reform,” by Ronald A. Smith, as well as articles about the post-Civil War underpinnings of college football and the struggles of female and black athletes. The last quarter of the class, beginning this week, concerns the North Carolina scandal, including the much smaller controversy that arose over the course itself.\n",
      "Smith is not trolling the university with the class, he said, although he wondered whether his superiors took it that way when two senior administrators seemed to be pressuring the then-department chair to cancel the course a few years ago. (The officials said their questions about the course had nothing to do with its content. The provost overturned a grievance committee’s finding that the officials’ interference had been undue.)\n",
      "More righteous than self-righteous, Smith said the course is an earnest attempt to fight for a fairer college sports system, at North Carolina and elsewhere.\n",
      "His class, he insisted, does not have an agenda. But it certainly has a point of view. And that includes the notion that efforts like the class itself are futile.\n",
      "“By examining all these earlier episodes of growth followed by hand-wringing and efforts at reform, which inevitably fail — what they see is there are systemic features in college athletics that hardened over time and became ever more intractable,” Smith said.\n",
      "Smith provides an unsentimental education that suggests a messy reality, one in which the scandal resulted from the workings of the college sports industry, including how it prevents athletes from getting a piece of the profits they generate.\n",
      "While Smith has clarified in class that he is antagonistic to the college sports industry rather than to college athletes, this ambiguity leads to misconceptions, according to Lydia Thompson, a senior on the rowing team who is taking the class.\n",
      "“Students hear critiques of the ways in which athletes have been abused by the educational system,” Thompson wrote in an email, “and automatically extrapolate those critiques and apply them to athletes who merely have to abide by the rules of that system.”\n",
      "Smith has taught at Chapel Hill since 1990, having arrived during the era of good feelings associated with the legendary late basketball coach Dean Smith (no relation). “I drank the Kool-Aid,” he said.\n",
      "Within three years of his arrival, though, according to a university report, the academic fraud had begun. It did not begin to come to light until 2011, right around when Jay Smith’s involvement with it commenced.\n",
      "That summer, a football player named Mike McAdoo\n",
      "sued the university\n",
      "and the N.C.A.A. over his ineligibility related to another instance of academic misconduct. A student-run honors court had suspended him for submitting a paper in a Swahili class for which a tutor had formatted footnotes. But the paper, which was disclosed in court filings, included plagiarism, and that discovery led to a stream of revelations that eventually exposed the fake-classes scandal.\n",
      "Smith was serving on a faculty committee overseeing the honors court. When a reporter asked to discuss McAdoo, Smith looked up the paper and was “flabbergasted,” he said, not only by its blatant evidence of plagiarism, but also because he knew the ostensible instructor of the course, Julius Nyang’oro, was not a language instructor. (Nyang’oro, the African and Afro-American Studies chair, was later found to be complicit in the scandal.)\n",
      "“All of this smelled really, really fishy to me,” Smith said.\n",
      "Smith and a few other faculty members convened an ad hoc group for academic reform. A neophyte when it came to college athletics, Smith was tutored by Richard Southall, a professor who directed the university’s College Sport Research Institute.\n",
      "Southall, whose institute is now housed at the University of South Carolina, said he gave the group a “primer” on college sports, with the thesis that scandals are the regular, inevitable consequence of the conflict between the N.C.A.A.’s amateurism model and market forces such as fan interest and player value.\n",
      "“Players understand their market value, coaches understand it, everybody understands it,” Southall said in an interview.\n",
      "To hear Smith tell it, the course, first taught over the summer of 2016, came naturally to him. As a historian, he said, “you look for developments over time, charting both continuities and change, and you identify the issues that seem to be at stake.”\n",
      "“I want them to leave the class with a reform spirit,” he added. “I want them to have a fresh appreciation for the way the system mistreats the athletes and why we need radical new thinking to correct those inequities.”\n",
      "Ally Mastroianni, a sophomore on North Carolina’s lacrosse team, said she had enrolled in Smith’s class out of a sense of responsibility. “I did want to learn about the scandal,” she said. “I feel as an athlete I should know the facts.”\n",
      "Her days are long, she said, filled with practice, rehab, classes, meals, homework and maybe some social time. Her main complaint about the relatively new Loudermilk Center for Excellence, a state-of-the-art athlete support center in the football stadium, is that it does not stay open past 10 p.m.\n",
      "“When I see people rolling their eyes, it’s hurtful,” she said of her classmates’ attitude toward Loudermilk, which Smith’s students toured. “I don’t think it’s just a sham.”\n",
      "Still, she did not regret enrolling in Smith’s course. It is, she said, “probably the most interesting class I’ve taken at U.N.C.”\n",

      "LOS ANGELES — The lawsuit recently filed by the U.S. women's soccer team is part of a wider public \"awakening\" to the challenges that women athletes face, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti told Reuters on Saturday.\n",
      "Speaking on the sidelines of the launch of an initiative aimed at the development of more women coaches, Garcetti said the suit against the U.S. Soccer Federation alleging wage discrimination marked an important step toward gender equality.\n",
      "\"I think there is an awakening happening in women's sports whether it's abuse, discrimination or simply having basic civil rights denied,\" he told Reuters.\n",
      "\"I support women athletes who are saying enough is enough. That for too long the federations have not done right by them to protect them and empower them,\" he said.\n",
      "\"It's an exciting moment to see that happening.\"\n",
      "Closing the pay gap between male and female athletes is critical to attracting women to professional sports, which will in turn boost the popularity of women's sports leagues, he said.\n",
      "Women would no longer accept being treated as second class citizens by their sports, he said, and will demand a greater share of the overall wealth it generates going forward.\n",
      "\"The WNBA survives and it has been great to see it survive but women who play in the WNBA have to cobble together jobs in Europe in between,\" he said.\n",
      "\"We have to step up as a society and say this matters and that men and women should be on as equal a footing as we can be.\"\n",
      "The next generation of woman athletes will be better served if they can see similarities between themselves, their coaches and the sports icons they look up to, U.S. gold medalist gymnast Laurie Hernandez said at the Women Coach LA launch event.\n",
      "\"I took it as a really big responsibility to be a role model for these kids,\" she told a gathering of about 400 women at the kickoff for the initiative, which is a partnership between the City of LA and Nike.\n",
      "\"Growing up I didn't see many, if any, Hispanic gymnasts and I just resorted to being my own person,\" she said.\n",
      "\"I guess I didn't realize how big of a deal it was to be a Hispanic American on the Olympic team because then so many little girls started becoming gymnasts,\" she said.\n",
      "\"And it's because they saw someone that looked like them.\"\n",

      "(Reuters) - Former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) featherweight Artem Lobov, a long-time friend and team mate of Conor McGregor, is set to make a lucrative debut in bare-knuckle boxing as combat sports bid to gain more mainstream acceptance.\n",
      "Nicknamed the \"Russian Hammer\", Lobov told Reuters he had accepted a big payday from the Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship to fight another UFC veteran, Jason Knight, on a pay-per-view card in Biloxi, Mississippi on Saturday.\n",
      "\"I'd be lying if I didn't tell you that money was a big factor in signing for Bare Knuckle - we're prize fighters, and our success is measured by the size of our purse,\" he said during a stopover in New York.\n",
      "Long considered the only realistic professional alternative outside of boxing for combat sports athletes, the UFC is now competing with other mixed martial arts and grappling promotions.\n",
      "European and Asian promotions are attracting sellout crowds, and the Bellator organization recently signed a large number of British and Irish prospects to try to make inroads in Europe.\n",
      "They were also on the trail of Lobov when he was released from the UFC in January.\n",
      "\"They made a very nice offer, a lot more than I was getting in the UFC, but it did not match the offer that Bare Knuckle made. With Bare Knuckle, I can also accept other offers as long as it doesn't interfere with their schedule, so it's a win-win for me,\" the 32-year-old said.\n",
      "\"I get to go in, fight bare-knuckle, make a lot of money, hopefully build a better name for myself and then see what else is out there.\"\n",
      "FRONT FOOT\n",
      "Though he has a losing professional record of 14 wins and 15 losses, Lobov is hugely popular with fans due to his fearless style of fighting off his front foot and his toughness, with 12 of his MMA losses coming by decision.\n",
      "Lobov brushes aside the suggestion that bare-knuckle boxing is more primitive than MMA.\n",
      "\"It might seem that way, but getting hit with a bare knuckle is not as raw as getting hit with a bare knee, or getting kicked with a shin to your head, which I have been a few times,\" he said. \"In that sense, it's nothing.\n",
      "\"I truly, truly love fighting, so that's not an issue for me. It's like saying to a swimmer, 'Do you mind getting wet?' Of course not, he's a swimmer,\" he said.\n",
      "Lobov credits Irishman McGregor, the former UFC featherweight and lightweight champion, with bringing combat sports into the mainstream in the U.S. and enabling him and many others to make a living as fighters.\n",
      "\"In many ways it is thanks to Conor, for sure, and it's definitely a lot better than before, but the best times are still ahead of us,\" Lobov said.\n",
      "\"Ten years ago I fought a top-10 European fighter on four days' notice for 400 pounds, and to go from that to where I am now, earning six figures for a fight? Certainly, I see the improvements in the sport.\"\n",
      "Though delighted to have a chance to test his boxing without the threat of kicks or takedowns, Lobov will be back in the MMA cage soon.\n",
      "\"I always seek the biggest challenge and MMA is the biggest challenge. I'm still grappling, I'm still wrestling and doing everything,\" he said.\n",
      "\"I want to improve and to achieve many, many things in MMA, boxing and bare-knuckle boxing.\"\n",

      "ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. — A blizzard of bets from college basketball fans in March helped New Jersey to its second-highest monthly sports betting total, as March Madness translated into March Gladness for sports books.\n",
      "More than $372 million in sports bets were made in the state last month. That brings New Jersey's total since sports betting began last June to over $2.3 billion.\n",
      "After paying off winning bets and accounting for expenses, New Jersey's sports books have made over $63 million from sports betting and paid $7.7 million in state taxes in the first three months of this year. New Jersey and Delaware are the only states with newly legalized sports betting to meet their tax revenue projections from the betting.\n",
      "Several sports books said the number of bets on the college basketball tournament and their dollar amounts exceeded those from the NFL's Super Bowl.\n",
      "\"In this year's first ever March Madness with legalized betting available, U.S. bettors further proved to be fervent college basketball fans, and submitted more bets on DraftKings Sportsbook for the opening weekend of the NCAA Tournament alone than the Super Bowl,\" said Jamie Shea, the company's head of digital sportsbook operations. \"While March had certainly been marked on our calendars before, this past tournament gave us a glimpse into the staggering business potential of college basketball in an expanded regulated betting market.\"\n",
      "FanDuel, whose sportsbook at the Meadowlands Racetrack in East Rutherford, near New York City, continues to lead the state in sports betting revenue at more than $32 million this year, said it had the best month any New Jersey operator has had since sports betting began in the state, earning $17.6 million. Monmouth Park Racetrack in Oceanport has made $5.4 million from sports bets so far this year.\n",
      "PlaySugarhouse saw its active users increase by 40% during the first week of the college basketball tournament compared to the week before, and its March revenue was up 23% compared to February.\n",
      "Of the nearly $1.1 billion in bets taken by New Jersey sportsbooks so far this year, more than $862,000 were made online. Several other states are struggling with whether to allow online sports betting as part of bills they are considering.\n",
      "Atlantic City's nine casinos and the two New Jersey racetracks that offer sports betting saw $294 million in casino gambling and sports betting revenue in March, up more than 34% from a year earlier. Only three casinos reported a revenue decline that month, with six showing an increase. Part of the increased total revenue is due to the fact that last March there were only seven casinos operating in Atlantic City, compared with nine now.\n",
      "The Borgata, as usual, led the pack with $65.7 million in March, up 1.3% from a year ago. The casino had its best March ever in terms of gross slot win ($41.7 million) and net slot win ($35 million), which excludes promotional credits given to gamblers.\n",
      "The Golden Nugget inched back into the No. 2 spot at $32 million, up 14% from a year ago. Tropicana was next at $31.3 million, down 4.2%, followed by Harrah's at $26.5 million, down 16.1%, and Caesars at $22.8 million, up 4.3%. Bally's took in $15.3 million, down 2.6%, and Resorts took in $15 million, up 1.2%.\n",
      "Among the two new casinos that opened last June, Hard Rock took in $26.3 million, and the Ocean Casino Resort took in $17.6 million.\n",
      "The casinos also were aided by more than $39 million in internet winnings, an increase of 53% compared to March 2018. Among internet-only entities, Resorts Digital more than tripled its revenue from a year ago to $15.7 million, and Caesars Interactive-NJ was up 16.4% to $5.1 million.\n",

      "The two Democrats are Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, chairman of the House oversight and reform committee, and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, chairman of the subcommittee on economic and consumer policy.\n",
      "They wrote to baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred on Thursday, saying they are wary of \"anticompetitive conduct.\" They asked for documents on potential acquisition and operation of the regional networks plus MLB's strategies. They also want MLB officials to brief committee staff.\n",
      "The Walt Disney Co. acquired 22 regional sports networks as part of its $71 billion purchase of 21st Century Fox's entertainment business last month. The Justice Department said last June that Disney had to sell the networks as a condition of the deal. The Yankees' YES Network is being sold separately by Disney.\n",
      "\"We are concerned that MLB's potential expansion of its business to RSNs could increase the risk of anticompetitive conduct that harms American consumers and, in turn, baseball itself,\" the congressmen wrote. \"This potential expansion also raises the question of whether additional limits on the league's antitrust exemption are warranted.\"\n",
      "Baseball was granted an antitrust exemption in 1922 by the Supreme Court, which ruled the sport was not interstate commerce. Congress passed a limited cutout that was signed into law in 1998, making the employment of major league players subject to antitrust law.\n",

      "In Virginia's 63-62 win over Auburn on Saturday, the discussion about whether Samir Doughty fouled Kyle Guy as Guy was shooting a 3-pointer with 0.6 seconds remaining turned out to be the simplest part of the debate.\n",
      "More difficult to untangle: Should that foul have been called under those circumstances? Many see it simply, others point out that worse infractions have been ignored.\n",
      "And what about the Ty Jerome, the Virginia guard who lost the ball, picked it up and then started dribbling again, on the play that came seconds earlier near midcourt? Should that have been whistled? And why didn't the refs call a foul when Bryce Brown grabbed Jerome's jersey as Jerome was trying to re-collect the ball just before he double-dribbled?\n",
      "It all happened in the blink of an eye — much easier to detect, and break down, with the help of super slow-motion and a couple different angles that none of the three officials had the luxury of seeing either while it was happening, or directly after it occurred. It was a judgment (non) call, so it wasn't subject to being reviewed, the way many tough, late-game calls are under the rules in college hoops.\n",
      "\"I would challenge anyone complaining about that call, I'd say, 'Did you recognize that in real time?'\" said Dean Blandino, the former vice president of officiating for the NFL. \"It's just one of those unusual plays that happen. When I used to be in officials' meetings, we would always say, 'Something is going to come up that's never happened before, so you just have to anticipate that.'\"\n",
      "But how to react to something that's never happened before?\n",
      "Less than three months ago, the Los Angeles Rams made the Super Bowl at the expense of the New Orleans Saints in the wake of an unthinkable non-call of an obvious pass-interference infraction late in that game.\n",
      "The NFL got pilloried for the call. Lawsuits were filed. The commissioner, Roger Goodell, got destroyed during his annual Super Bowl press conference for failing to promise immediate change.\n",
      "Only last week did the league's teams vote to make pass interference calls, and non-calls, reviewable .\n",
      "\"But you do that, and you're potentially creating a whole host of other issues,\" Blandino said.\n",
      "Only time will tell what they are.\n",
      "Serena Williams in tennis. Dustin Johnson in golf. The 1972 U.S. Olympic basketball team . The \"Hand of God \" in soccer. Fifth down for Colorado in college football.\n",
      "Blown calls, controversial calls and calls that were \"correct\" according to the rulebook but questionable given the circumstances are nothing new to sports. Sometimes, the reaction of the wronged party can be as memorable as the call itself.\n",
      "After Saturday's whistle, Auburn coach Bruce Pearl, apoplectic at first, diffused the situation as best he could: \"There are lots of calls during the game, and you're going to get some, and some you're not going to get,\" he said.\n",
      "That's boilerplate material for good sportsmanship and teaching your players, and fans, how to handle the toughest of situations.\n",
      "Similar emotions sometimes manifest themselves in other types of cruel or redeeming moments. On Sunday, Guy explained how his winning free throws followed a year rebuilding his confidence after Virginia's historic 16-over-1 loss last year. A few hours later, Notre Dame star Arike Ogunbowale lost a chance to repeat as hero in the women's NCAA final by missing a free throw she intended to make and then making a free throw she intended to miss.\n",
      "In general, O'Sullivan warns it's not good to use the examples set in elite sports as lessons for how to behave at the youth or recreational level.\n",
      "\"Those are two different things,\" he said. \"One is sport for entertainment, the other is sport for development.\"\n",
      "Sometimes, especially in places where sports are so enmeshed with daily life, they seem hard to separate.\n",
      "But even at Toomer's Corner in Auburn, the sun came up the next morning. America started counting down to Monday night's big game, and fans on every side could agree on one thing: Hopefully an official's call won't decide it.\n",
      "\"Regardless of the circumstances, we're all human,\" said Craig Littlepage, the former athletic director at Virginia. \"We all have to realize that it's sports. There are going to be mistakes made along the way.\"\n",

      "The sports radio personality Craig Carton was sentenced to three and a half years in prison on Friday by a longtime fan and listener — the judge — for a ticket reselling scheme that ended his broadcast partnership with the former N.F.L. quarterback Boomer Esiason.\n",
      "Carton, convicted in November of conspiracy, wire fraud and securities fraud, was sentenced by Chief Judge Colleen McMahon in Manhattan federal court.\n",
      "She greeted him like a radio listener.\n",
      "“Good afternoon, Mr. Carton. Colleen from New York. First time, long time,” the judge said, adding that she used to listen to his show as she drove to court.\n",
      "“I knew you could be fun to listen to,” she said. “I also knew you could be a jerk.”\n",
      "The prison term was half of what prosecutors sought after Carton was convicted at a November trial of soliciting and then largely gambling away nearly $7 million.\n",
      "Geoffrey S. Berman, United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a release that Carton’s ticket resale business, which purported to use his connections to obtain good seats for events like Metallica and Barbra Streisand concerts, was an “elaborate fiction.”\n",
      "Carton, a 50-year-old Manhattan resident, blamed his fall from a measure of celebrity and wealth on “wildly stupid decisions” he made as he tried to cope with memories of being sexually abused at age 11.\n",
      "He said memories of the abuse were set off by revelations of the crimes of Jerry Sandusky, a former Penn State football assistant who was convicted of child sexual abuse in 2012. That led him first to speak angrily and more emotionally than he ever had before on WFAN’s “Boomer and Carton” show, which he co-hosted for years with Esiason. Then he could not sleep.\n",
      "“Nobody knows what it’s like when lights go out and you lay in bed awake and the demons come,” Carton said.\n",
      "He recalled turning to blackjack and eventually developing a gambling addiction so serious that winning and losing became irrelevant.\n",
      "Carton said his arrest in 2017 was a “lightning bolt of awareness for me.” He said he had joined Gamblers Anonymous and was undergoing therapy.\n",
      "“I am truly powerless over this disease,” Carton said. His last bet — a loss — came in June, he added.\n",
      "Before describing the sentence, the judge said she had enjoyed Carton’s show, except when it became too “raunchy.”\n",
      "But she likened his crimes to those of the financier Bernard L. Madoff, who is serving a 150-year prison sentence, though she said Madoff’s scheme, in which he squandered roughly $20 billion, went on far longer.\n",
      "The judge dismissed Carton’s claims that he never meant to lose investors’ money, saying it was a common justification in financial crimes.\n",
      "“The money always runs out at some point, and only then do you realize the road to your personal hell was truly paved with your good intentions,” she said.\n",
      "“Craig Carton, you have indeed descended into a hell of your own making,” the judge said. “Everything you spent a lifetime of building up is gone. Your marriage is over. Your family is decimated. Your kids are terrified. Your career is in tatters. Your reputation is lost.”\n",
      "She did, however, praise Carton’s plan to publicly urge others to stop gambling as she ordered him to pay $4.8 million in restitution and to forfeit $4.2 million. He also must do 150 hours of community service.\n",
      "She said Carton could perhaps someday resume a radio show, which he left after his arrest, but she noted one of the biggest advertisers on sports radio shows seemed to be legal gambling businesses.\n",
      "“That troubles me,” the judge said.\n",
      "Carton must report to prison on July 15.\n",

      "MONTREAL — McGill University has dropped the name Redmen from its varsity sports teams after receiving complaints that the name is a racial slur.\n",
      "Principal Suzanne Fortier said in a statement Friday that the name had caused pain and alienation for indigenous students at the Canadian university. The change took effect immediately.\n",
      "\"Today, 'redmen' is widely acknowledged as an offensive term for Indigenous peoples, as evidenced by major English dictionaries,\" Fortier said.\n",
      "In recent years, American sports teams at amateur, college and professional levels have faced similar criticisms.\n",
      "Last year, the Cleveland Indians baseball team removed Chief Wahoo as its logo. Stanford, North Dakota, St. John's (also once the Redmen) and Dartmouth are also among the colleges and universities that have dropped Native American nicknames or symbols for their teams.\n",
      "However, longstanding pressure to change the name of the Washington Redskins NFL team has so far been unsuccessful.\n",
      "McGill's decision comes after an internal report revealed deep divisions between students and alumni over the nearly century-old name.\n",
      "Even though the Redmen name was not initially adopted as a reference to indigenous people, the association was made in the 1950s when men's and women's teams came to be nicknamed the \"Indians\" and \"Squaws.\" Some teams later adopted a logo with an indigenous man wearing a headdress.\n",
      "The student who led the fight against the name told The Canadian Press he was \"ecstatic\" at the news.\n",
      "\"I had expected the name change,\" Tomas Jirousek said in an interview from Prague. \"I think if the principal had been actually listening to indigenous community members and students, I think it was the only possible option after, as she said in her email, 'the depth of pain' we feel as indigenous students at the Redmen name.\"\n",
      "Meanwhile, a group of alumni who opposed the name change said they would never again donate to McGill and would discourage their children from applying to the school.\n",

      "Robin and David Kowalski barely recognized their daughter Bailey when she was visiting home in White Lake, Mich., in the spring of 2015.\n",
      "Their perennially positive daughter, who was about to finish her freshman year at Michigan State, was sullen. She had suddenly decided to abandon her long-held dream of being a sports journalist, and she refused to tell her mother, in whom she typically confided everything, why.\n",
      "It was not until October, after months of erratic behavior, that Ms. Kowalski told her parents that she had been raped by three Michigan State basketball players that April. The incident left her depressed and considering harming herself. She dropped out of college for a while and received counseling. She gave up sports journalism for good.\n",
      "Last year, Ms. Kowalski, 22, who is speaking publicly about her case for the first time, sued Michigan State in federal court for violating her rights under Title IX, the federal law mandating gender equity in higher education, as a Jane Doe. The lawsuit asserts that Michigan State mishandles sexual misconduct complaints against athletes. One woman said two football players raped her in 2009, but she was not advised of her Title IX rights, the lawsuit said, and another woman said three basketball players raped her in 2010, after which the accusations were not reported outside the athletic department.\n",
      "A Michigan State motion to dismiss the case is pending. A university spokeswoman, Emily Guerrant, declined to comment on the case while the litigation is ongoing but said Michigan State “is dedicated to making sure every student receives fair treatment and support when they need it.”\n",
      "Ms. Kowalski has decided to come forward, hoping she can persuade other victims, at Michigan State or elsewhere, to tell their stories.\n",
      "According to Ms. Kowalski, when a university counselor learned that the men who she said assailed her were members of the basketball team — a storied and treasured program that has played in 10 Final Fours, including this year’s — the counselor discouraged her from reporting it, the lawsuit said.\n",
      "“If you pursue this, you are going to be swimming with some really big fish,” a staff member told Ms. Kowalski, the lawsuit said.\n",
      "Ms. Kowalski plans to hold a news conference in East Lansing on Thursday, the fourth anniversary of the incident. A month later, she will graduate from Michigan State.\n",
      "“I don’t want any other girl who has gone through this or who God forbid may have to go through something like this to feel for one second that they should be too afraid to come out and do something,” Ms. Kowalski said in a phone interview last week.\n",
      "Her lawyer, Karen Truszkowski, said that a separate Title IX investigation initiated by the university last June had dragged on.\n",
      "“It will not be resolved within a year,” said Ms. Truszkowski, who declined to discuss the substance of the investigation because it is pending. “That has consumed her entire senior year.”\n",
      "Ms. Kowalski is still declining to name the men she says raped her on the night of April 11, 2015. All were members of the 2014-15 Spartans team, she said. She has not filed a police report, but is considering doing so.\n",
      "It’s still unclear to Ms. Kowalski who at Michigan State eventually learned about what she told the counselor. “I still to this day don’t know who knew,” she said. “How far up. Who was the last person to know about what I told the counselor in the counseling center the day I went in?”\n",
      "More than a year ago, Michigan State’s president and athletic director resigned after the depredations of Lawrence G. Nassar, the former university doctor who has been accused of sexual abuse by hundreds of women, including Olympic gymnasts, and convicted of sex crimes, became a source of national outrage.\n",
      "Also last winter, ESPN\n",
      "reported\n",
      "several previously undisclosed sexual misconduct allegations against members of Michigan State’s football and men’s basketball programs. In several instances, ESPN said, the accusations were handled by the athletics program, rather than the venues mandated by federal law.\n",
      "“There’s a lot that they have yet to take accountability for, as far as what’s going on in the athletic department and the systematic errors that are allowing the athletic department to be put above females that have been victims of sexual assault by athletes,” Ms. Kowalski said.\n",
      "The lawsuit states that the sexual assault occurred in April 2015 after an informal celebration at an East Lansing bar for the basketball team, which had recently returned from the Final Four in Indianapolis, where it lost to the eventual champion, Duke, in the national semifinals. (Ms. Kowalski, days away from turning 19, said she used fake identification to enter the bar.)\n",
      "Ms. Kowalski’s roommate encouraged her to approach the players.\n",
      "“I knew their stats, numbers, everything,” Ms. Kowalski said, adding, “She knew how I looked up to those guys.”\n",
      "A team member invited Ms. Kowalski to his place for a party, and she accepted a drive to an off-campus apartment, the lawsuit said. When she arrived, there was no one else there, and Ms. Kowalski, who had already had trouble holding her glass at the bar despite not drinking much, had trouble controlling her thumbs to send a text, the lawsuit said.\n",
      "The three players took turns raping her, the lawsuit said. She woke up later in the apartment and took a taxi back to her dorm.\n",
      "Ms. Kowalski visited the Michigan State University Counseling Center roughly a week later, she said. The counselor she met with appeared to change her response to Ms. Kowalski upon learning that the men she said had attacked her were members of the basketball team. The counselor immediately insisted on having a second person in the room, the lawsuit said. Ms. Kowalski was not advised to seek a physical exam or pregnancy or S.T.D. testing, and was not made aware of her rights under Title IX.\n",
      "With cases with “guys with big names,” she was told, according to the lawsuit, the best thing was to “just get yourself better.”\n",
      "“She lived with that thought of, ‘Just get yourself better,’” said her mother, Robin Kowalski, in a phone interview last week.\n",
      "When Bailey Kowalski first sued Michigan State last spring, the university rebutted her claims in a statement with significant and unusual detail. “We have not found any evidence or indication that she was discouraged in any way to make a Title IX complaint or a complaint to the police department,” it said. It also said that the university police eventually contacted her.\n",
      "A day later, Michigan State’s former interim president, John Engler, said in a statement, “We regret that we provided an unnecessary amount of detail” in the initial response.\n",
      "“They went out to the press and essentially addressed my lawsuit as a lie,” Ms. Kowalski said, “which basically was a message to anyone else coming forward with allegations similar to mine that, ‘If you’re going to do that, we’re going to completely exploit you.’”\n",
      "After taking much of a semester off and receiving outpatient psychiatric treatment, Ms. Kowalski elected to return to Michigan State, believing that transferring to an unknown campus where she did not know anyone would have been worse. Her brother is currently a sophomore at Michigan State.\n",
      "She suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, she said, and felt she could never return to the vocation to which she had long aspired. She switched from a planned double-major in journalism and Spanish to one in biology. She hopes eventually to become a veterinarian.\n",

      "MOSCOW — After years of using hacked data to vilify Western athletes as cheats who bend the rules to take banned substances, Russia is warming to a controversial part of the anti-doping system.\n",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin said in 2017 that the country's rivals were using Therapeutic Use Exemptions to game the system. The exemptions allow athletes to treat medical conditions with substances that would otherwise be banned.\n",
      "If they were really ill, Putin said, \"maybe they should enter the Paralympics.\"\n",
      "Late last month, though, Putin gave a high-profile speaking slot at a meeting of his Fitness and Sports Council to a veteran gymnastics official who urged Russians to apply for more TUEs.\n",
      "\"We must use this opportunity on a legal basis,\" Irina Viner-Usmanova told the televised meeting, calling on the sports ministry and the government's Federal Medical-Biological Agency to help.\n",
      "Russia's years of doping scandals, she said, had taught Russia to use legitimate avenues properly.\n",
      "\"This experience let us be more attentive and law-abiding when taking medical products,\" Viner-Usmanova said.\n",
      "Statistics show TUEs are in demand as Russia returns to sports following bans, like from last year's Winter Olympics.\n",
      "The Russian anti-doping agency, known as RUSADA, received a record 101 TUE applications last year, and is on track to breeze past that number this year. After years when doping was widespread in Russian sport, the agency hails the rise as the result of better education and legitimate sports medicine.\n",
      "Despite the rise in applications, RUSADA says athletes and team doctors struggle to understand the system. Only 22 applications were approved last year.\n",
      "Officials from RUSADA and the UK Anti-Doping Agency, which handled Russian TUEs until September, turned down applications which lacked medical documents, or from athletes asking for medicines that weren't actually banned.\n",
      "RUSADA deputy CEO Margarita Pakhnotskaya argued that even the more clueless applications at least indicate growing respect for the rules. She said \"one or two\" filings seemed like an attempt to cheat and were passed on to RUSADA's investigations unit.\n",
      "While some Russian athletes may be getting TUEs direct from international sports federations, RUSADA's numbers remain relatively low by European standards. Not all agencies publish TUE data, though Norway granted 85 applications and refused nine last year, while German figures for 2017 show 72 approvals and seven rejections.\n",
      "In the high-stakes world of Olympic sports, athletes can risk a ban for failing to declare some relatively common medications. Without the TUE system, athletes who get injured or have longer-term conditions like asthma might have to spend long periods on the sidelines until medicines left their system completely, or risk their health by going without treatment.\n",
      "Russia's ire at Western athletes followed regular hacks by the Fancy Bears group — which U.S. law enforcement said last year was a cover for Russian military intelligence.\n",
      "The Fancy Bears' website, which once promised \"sensational proof of famous athletes taking doping substances,\" now bears a message that it has been seized by the FBI. The Russian government denies involvement in hacking.\n",
      "The Fancy Bears published dozens of athletes' medical histories, though no Russian TUEs. Stripped of their context — injuries or illness — many applications were legitimate but looked suspicious.\n",
      "One case in particular rocked the world of cycling. The leaked documents revealed that Tour de France champion Bradley Wiggins sought TUEs for injections of triamcinolone acetate before key races in 2011, 2012 and 2013. He denied wrongdoing and was not banned, but a series of high-profile investigations damaged his reputation and that of Team Sky.\n",
      "The TUE process still carries a stigma in Russia.\n",
      "Russian biathlete Margarita Vasilyeva told state TV last month that despite having asthma, she refused to get permission to use an inhaler.\n",
      "\"It's not really honest, I think,\" said Vasilyeva, who faces separate doping-related difficulties after being accused of failing to make herself available for testing on three occasions.\n",
      "Pakhnotskaya, whose job includes running educational seminars on anti-doping across Russia, doesn't want athletes to dismiss TUEs out of hand. After all, who knows when they might get ill?\n",
      "\"I don't think all Russian athletes or all Russian officials should wake up and think how great TUE requests are,\" she said. \"But each one who has the right to get it should know the procedure.\"\n",

      "MINNEAPOLIS — This Final Four is the fifth anniversary of one of the most effective, if inadvertent, instances of athlete activism in college sports.\n",
      "This was when the Connecticut star Shabazz Napier, speaking to the news media shortly before the 2014 national championship game, said that he sometimes did not have enough to eat.\n",
      "“There are hungry nights that I go to bed and I’m starving,” he said.\n",
      "Within weeks, the N.C.A.A.’s board of directors for Division I voted to\n",
      "lift\n",
      "restrictions on how much teams could feed their players. No longer would there be bizarre hairsplitting over what was and was not a meal (notoriously, serving peanuts\n",
      "did not count\n",
      ", while serving peanut butter did). Now teams can and do routinely give athletes feasts.\n",
      "This common-sense reform had been in the works and probably would have occurred eventually. But the stark comments by a high-profile player at the N.C.A.A.’s signature event ensured the nearly immediate change and boatloads of attention on the N.C.A.A.’s power over college athletes.\n",
      "It is fruitful to remember the efficacy of Napier’s comments, because we are at a moment when it appears that further reform to college sports’ much-maligned policy of amateurism will come only from within. The players will have the foremost and maybe even exclusive power to agitate for change.\n",
      "What would have happened if Zion Williamson had said, after his Nike shoe exploded, jeopardizing his career, that enough was enough, that he no longer would wear a shoe for nothing while his coach was at least indirectly paid millions by Nike? And that no other player should put up with this hypocrisy, either?\n",
      "“The power is with labor and the players,” said Kain Colter, the former Northwestern quarterback who led a unionization drive among his teammates several years ago.\n",
      "This was most obviously displayed in 2015, when Missouri football players threatened to sit out a game unless the university president stepped down or was fired. He stepped down. That the boycott concerned the campus’s racial climate rather than the players’ compensation ought not conceal the reality of what happened: The players — unpaid, un-unionized — flexed their muscles, and the system gave in.\n",
      "Vesting power in athletes to reform sports is not historically aberrant. From Jackie Robinson withstanding taunts, threats and worse to break Major League Baseball’s color line; to baseball players striking in the 1970s and ’80s to gain and keep full-fledged free agency; to the track standout Edwin Moses devising benefits for Olympic athletes, athletes have often been the ones bringing about change. Their leverage is unmatched: They are the ones the fans pay to see, and therefore the ones who ultimately have the power over profit.\n",
      "And they are the only ones with a steady interest in, well, their own interest.\n",
      "Consider what else has happened since Napier’s comments.\n",
      "Colter’s unionization effort, which a National Labor Relations Board regional director endorsed weeks before Napier’s Final Four, was squashed by the overall board.\n",
      "The antitrust lawsuit that might have allowed players to profit off the use of their likenesses in video games and other media ended in an extremely limited victory for players.\n",
      "Last month, a second antitrust suit, which sought to explode the N.C.A.A.’s ban on compensation, concluded at the district-court level with a technical victory for players that\n",
      "looked as much like a victory for the establishment\n",
      ". A federal judge ruled that the N.C.A.A. could continue to limit payments to players that were not directly related to education.\n",
      "“The courts are not a forum where you’re going to get relief,” said Don Yee, a sports lawyer and players-rights advocate.\n",
      "For Yee, who also happens to be Tom Brady’s agent, the solution is “private entrepreneurialism.” He is planning a small professional football league that would field players not yet eligible for the N.F.L. (which generally requires players to be three years removed from high school). It would be developmental, like college football, but unlike college football, average pay would be $50,000.\n",
      "A planned summer basketball league, the\n",
      "Historical Basketball League\n",
      ", would pay scholarships for its college-level players while enabling them to sell their names, images and likenesses to sponsors. The N.B.A.’s development league plans to offer higher salaries. The probable dissolution of the one-and-done rule in the next few years will again permit the most talented high school graduates to jump straight to the N.B.A. instead of having to spend at least a year in college.\n",
      "A few states, notably North Carolina and California, have bills floating around that would allow athletes to be paid if, say, a video game uses their names and likenesses.\n",
      "All these efforts are well intentioned. But if past is prologue, the system will not be successfully reformed in such patchwork fashion.\n",
      "Nor is the college sports establishment likely to change its mind of its own volition.\n",
      "At a news conference in Minneapolis last week, the N.C.A.A. president, Mark Emmert, said that he had sought to increase athlete participation in college sports’ governance.\n",
      "“I’m a lifelong academic,” he said. “I grew up with that tradition, and I never worked at a school that didn’t have students on their board, and they were full voting board members. They voted on my contract, and I think that’s just perfectly appropriate.”\n",
      "There are athletes serving on several important councils, but there is\n",
      "not one\n",
      "on the N.C.A.A. Board of Governors. No athletes vote on Emmert’s contract, which was extended late last year through 2023.\n",
      "Tim Nevius, a onetime N.C.A.A. investigator whose experiences led him to turn on the system, believes the answer lies with player activism. Last month, he announced a new organization, the College Athlete Advocacy Initiative, that plans to pair his business representing athletes before the N.C.A.A. with trying to advocate for broader reform in coordination with players.\n",
      "He acknowledged in an interview the challenges, including the relatively short time spans that college athletes actually are college athletes, as well as their current lack of formal bargaining power. But he insisted that player action was the surest avenue to change.\n",
      "“There are powers here that the athletes have,” he said, “and we have to simply have them realize it and help them take the power into their own hands.”\n",
      "Ros Gold-Unwude, a Turner Sports analyst and former Stanford basketball player, said last month that she expected to hear more from college athletes about how they felt about their position in the pecking order.\n",
      "“That’s the way our culture is, where we all are telling our stories on social media platforms,” she said.\n",
      "“If you’re really struggling or hungry,” she added, “that experience will come out.”\n",
      "Apathy will come out as well, though. Beyond the structural obstacles to athletes deciding the system is unfair and determining to act to change it, a player could validly decide that he is happy receiving what he currently gets.\n",
      "Napier, who is now a reserve on the Nets and who through a spokesman declined to comment for this article, said more during his “hungry nights” speech heard ’round the world, even though it received less publicity.\n",
      "He noted that there were other wrongs. Players’ jerseys were sold to fans, and the players did not receive a cut. More basically, he said, the players were not paid.\n",
      "It was, he suggested, wrong. Probably.\n",
      "“Something can change, something should change,” Napier said five years ago. “But if it doesn’t, at the end of the day, we’ve been doing this for so long.”\n",

      "Russia has been rocked by several sporting bans in recent years after international investigations found evidence of widespread, state-sponsored doping in athletics and a string of other sports.\n",
      "The amendments, which envisage fines of between 30,000 and 50,000 rubles for drug cheats, must still be approved by the upper chamber of parliament and signed by President Vladimir Putin before they become law.\n",

      "Yet when sorting through all the games, personalities and events that helped shape college basketball into the billion-dollar colossus it is today, it's hard to look past the name \"Virginia.\"\n",
      "It's the program that gave us one of the sport's greatest players in Ralph Sampson, and its two biggest upsets, by Chaminade and the world's most famous No. 16 seed in the University of Maryland-Baltimore County. Virginia is now on the verge of writing a new chapter — one that arguably wouldn't be appreciated by nearly as many people were it not for the huge platform Virginia hoops helped create.\n",
      "The Cavaliers play Texas Tech for the NCAA Tournament title Monday with a chance to add \"national champion\" to a resume already brimming with color and characters.\n",
      "\"University of Virginia holds a unique place in college basketball,\" said Craig Littlepage, the program's former longtime athletic director and one-time assistant basketball coach. \"Yes, there were some painful experiences. But if you look at them two years down the road, or 10 years, or 20 years, those things (were) good for the overall health of the game.\"\n",
      "Even in today's overhyped world of instant, nonstop sports analysis, Virginia's 77-72 loss on Dec. 23, 1982, to Chaminade of the NAIA remains among the handful of the very most shocking upsets in sports history.\n",
      "The Cavaliers scheduled the game to keep the limbs loose on their way back from Tokyo, where they had played Hakeem Olajuwon, Clyde Drexler and Houston's Phi Slama Jama juggernaut as part of an early season tournament. Less than two weeks before that, it had been Virginia vs. Patrick Ewing and Georgetown in a meeting then billed as the Game of the Decade .\n",
      "Virginia stood front-and-center in what college basketball was becoming in the early 1980s, a few years after Larry Bird and Magic Johnson set the stage with their epic meeting in the 1979 national final.\n",
      "But that Chaminade game broke through the sports pages and onto to the front pages. Virginia was ranked No. 1 in the country and Sampson was the three-time national player of the year. Things like that simply weren't supposed to happen.\n",
      "\"It was one of those things that, for sure, had to have been a misprint or a miscommunication,\" Littlepage said.\n",
      "It was not.\n",
      "And in the hours — then days, months and years — that followed, the legend of that upset remains strong.\n",
      "\"We didn't really realize how big it was until the next day,\" Mark Rodrigues, the Chaminade point guard, told The Associated Press in a recent reminisce about the game. \"That's when AP was calling, everyone's sports department was calling, it was getting on CNN news, the local news and then you realize what really happened.\"\n",
      "Increasing popularity and more TV exposure helped spread the word about all the good programs out there, and the talent spread out with it.\n",
      "Upsets became more common. Picking them became a pastime, as the NCAA Tournament bracket morphed into an office pool, and that turned into a small industry of its own.\n",
      "Virginia was a bit player in — and two-time loser to — Jim Valvano's North Carolina State team during its miracle run through the 1983 tournament.\n",
      "The year after Sampson left college, Virginia made the Final Four. That trip was a mere footnote in a 1980s hoops archive that included Villanova's shocker over Georgetown in the 1985 final and Danny Manning lifting Kansas to a similar upset over Oklahoma in 1988.\n",
      "The NCAA Tournament expanded to 64 teams to start turning into the behemoth it is today — one that will soon command more than $1 billion a year in TV revenue from CBS and its partners.\n",
      "Through all that, one unfulfilled occurrence remained the last bastion of \"Things That Will Never Happen\" in college hoops. In the 33-year history of the first-round matchups between 1 seeds and 16s, the 16 had never prevailed.\n",
      "Then came Virginia. Again.\n",
      "Its 74-54 loss last year to the Terriers of UMBC sent shockwaves across the country and reminded everyone, once again, of why they play these games.\n",
      "\"During last year's game, I had my phone on the table (on press row) and I started getting texts from old teammates,\" said Jim Miller, the Virginia forward who played with Sampson in the 1980s and was calling the UMBC loss on radio last year. \"They all said, 'Maybe they'll stop talking about Chaminade now.'\"\n",
      "More likely, they won't.\n",
      "Miller says that even today, the two questions he's asked the most are: What was it like to play with Ralph Sampson? And, Were you on the team that lost to Chaminade?\n",
      "And so, in his mind, the real legacy of Virginia basketball might be this: \"On any given night,\" he said, \"something like that can happen.\"\n",

      "AdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersLISBON — Plans to reform and possible expand European club competition ran into opposition on Friday as the continent's leagues declared they were 'united' in their determination to protect domestic football.The European Leagues umbrella group said it would take a more active role in influencing public opinion and shaping the future of football on the continent and reiterated its claim that fans prefer domestic league action to UEFA competition.Meanwhile, the English Premier League, one of the European Leagues' 35 members, said its 20 clubs would \"vigorously defend\" it against any plans to impose a new calendar. UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said on being re-elected in February that he would work with the European Club Association (ECA), which groups 232 of the region's biggest clubs, to \"design the club competitions of the future.\"The ECA, in turn, said it wanted more teams playing more matches in continental competitions. European Leagues, which says it represents 900-plus clubs through its affiliates including \"those who are not normally playing European football\", said domestic football should remain the priority.\"Our main objective is to safeguard the domestic competitions and protect the domestic competitions if needed,\" its president Lars-Christer Olsson told a news conference.\"These are the most important to the fans, they are much more important than any international competitions.\"Olsson added: \"These are interesting times. When it comes to real issues, I am happy to see all leagues are united.\"Although UEFA has only just started discussing its plans, Olsson said it was important that the public knew what was happening. \"We have to make the views of the European Leagues known to everyone, not only stakeholders but also fans and the public so everyone knows what is going on and how we are preparing for the future club competitions,\" he said.Olsson added that the last 10 years had been negative for domestic leagues as revenue from UEFA competition had increased the gap between the richest clubs and the rest.The Premier League said that in a statement that it had \"significant concerns\" over reported plans to change the format and qualifying criteria for European tournaments.\"All clubs unanimously agreed it is inappropriate for European football bodies to create plans that would alter the structures, calendar and competitiveness of the domestic game and will work together to protect the Premier League,\" it said.\"We have a fantastic combination of competitive football and committed fans that we will vigorously defend,\" it continued, adding that allegiances and local rivalries were often passed down through generations.The Premier League said it would ensure that \"European football bodies understand the importance of this, and their obligation to maintain the health and sustainability of domestic league football.\" (Writing by Brian Homewood; Editing by Christian Radnedge)Advertisement\n",
      "AdvertisementSupported byBy Reuters(Reuters) - Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has urged Tottenham Hotspur full back Danny Rose not to let racism win by following through on his plan to walk away from football when his playing career ends.England international Rose said on Thursday that he could not wait to leave football because he had had enough of the racism in the game and was frustrated by the response of the authorities to the abuse.Rose was among several English players who were victims of offensive chanting in a Euro 2020 qualifier in Montenegro last month.Guardiola, whose City team play Tottenham in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday, said Rose should stay in football and continue to fight racism from within the game. \"The best way to fight and combat this kind of terrible situation is fighting and being there every day - and of course (Rose) is an extraordinary footballer,\" Guardiola told a news conference on Friday.\"I will tell him when I see him next Tuesday.\"The chanting in Montenegro gave fresh impetus to the debate over whether the game's authorities are doing enough to tackle racism in soccer.UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said this month that referees should stop matches when players have been subjected to racial abuse, while Rose's England team mate Raheem Sterling called for stiffer sanctions for fans who racially abuse players.

      "AdvertisementSupported byBy Reuters(Reuters) - Brazil's female footballers have made great strides in growing their domestic game but they lack the organisation to emulate the United States team and demand the same pay and conditions as men, defender Erika told Reuters on Tuesday.The Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) this year obliged all first division clubs to create a women's side and are funding them directly, officials said.But their income is still vastly inferior to their male counterparts and Erika said she is envious of the World Cup-winning U.S. squad, 28 of whom sued the U.S. Soccer Federation last month in a lawsuit that includes complaints about wages and working conditions.\"I think it is sensational what the U.S. players did,\" she said in a phone interview from Spain, the day after Brazil lost 1-0 to Scotland in a friendly, their ninth consecutive defeat.\"We have the strength to do the same in Brazil but we don't have courage or the (people) to guide us.\"The U.S. women are a gigantic force. They have won a lot and that makes it easier for them to fight for what they want. We need to be united but we haven't managed that.\"Erika blamed that lack of unity on geography. Most of the Brazilian women play their club football outside the country and get together only for international games, which makes organising more difficult.\"I think distance is a problem,\" the 31-year-old Corinthians defender said. \"The principal players are based outside the country and that makes it more complicated, if they were all able to be here it would make it easier to develop, and we'd be stronger. \"Sadly, we still think individually.\"The Brazilian players nevertheless looked at recent big crowds for women's matches in Spain and Italy – a world record 60,739 people turned out to see Atletico Madrid take on Barcelona last month - as indicative of the growing power of the female game.Women's football has gained a higher profile this year in Brazil, with the CBF paying to help women's teams compete in the 16-team first division and also setting up a second division and under-18 league. \"Without a doubt here has been a huge growth and there is a long way to go,\" Erika said. \"I want to see the kind of crowds we saw in Madrid in Brazil. It inspires us.\"Brazil are one of 24 teams who will take part in the Women's World Cup in France from June 7-July 7. (Reporting by Andrew Downie; Editing by Christian Radnedge)Advertisement\n"

      "AdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersLONDON — England defender Danny Rose has had enough of racism in the game and said he cannot wait to get out of football amid frustration over the response of the authorities to the abuse.Tottenham Hotspur full back Rose was among the players who were victims of offensive chanting when they played for England in Montenegro last month in a Euro 2020 qualifier.“I’ve had enough,” Rose, 28, was quoted as saying by The Guardian on Thursday. “At the minute, how I programme myself is that I just think: ‘I’ve got five or six more years left in football and I just can’t wait to see the back of it’.“Seeing how things are done in the game at the minute, I just want to get out of it.\"Rose feels not enough action is being taken and the disparity in the punishment highlights its ineffectiveness.“Obviously, it is a bit sad (to feel like this) but when countries only get fined what I’d probably spend on a night out in London, what do you expect?” he added.“You see my manager get banned for two games for just being confrontational against Mike Dean,” he said of Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino’s two-match touchline ban for confronting the referee at the end of a 2-1 defeat at Burnley in February.“But yet a country can only get fined a little bit of money for being racist. It’s just a bit of a farce at the minute. So that’s where we are at in football and until there’s a harsh punishment, there’s not much else we can expect.\"Rose said he had expected the racist abuse dished out to him and his England team mates Raheem Sterling and Callum Hudson-Odoi during the match against Montenegro in Podgorica.“I played in Serbia about eight years ago and it happened there. So I sort of thought it would be a possibility that it might happen again and it did. “I looked up straight away in the first half and I know the exact time it happened in the first half.“But it didn’t affect my game. I’m a big boy now and I know that three points are obviously not the most important thing when you’re going through something like that, but I just wanted the team to get three points so that we could move on and get out of Montenegro as quickly as possible,” Rose said.England are top of 2020 European Championship qualifying Group A with a maximum six points after their 5-1 win in Montenegro and a 5-0 home victory over the Czech Republic.

      "AdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinThe Jets, a football team that has been an N.F.L. punch line for years, asked a comedian to be the master of ceremonies at a loud, flashy event to unveil the team’s new uniforms on Thursday.J.B. Smoove, who has been a suffering Jets fan for decades, stood on the stage at Gotham Hall in Manhattan and urged the star players who were modeling the new threads to wear them proudly and become accustomed to them.“Get comfortable,” Smoove said to quarterback Sam Darnold. “These are your damn pajamas.”When a team finishes last in three consecutive seasons, and has not made the playoffs in eight, sometimes the best approach is to make cosmetic changes and laugh about it. This, after all, is a team that counts “The Butt Fumble” among its most memorable moments of the last several years, so maybe a change was in order.Yet, aside from Smoove, the Jets were very serious — even solemn, at times — about this new endeavor, treating the unveiling of the new uniform at an event space on Broadway much the way a major tech company introduces a fancy new device.There was a D.J., flashing lights, a celebratory video, cheerleaders and, of course, fans chanting J-E-T-S. It was as close as the Jets get to a parade these days.They said that work on the new uniforms began in 2014, which is a long time for anything to do with fashion. Christopher Johnson, the chairman and chief executive, quipped that it took longer to come up with the new duds than it did to build the team’s current stadium in New Jersey.But he noted that it was the perfect moment for a new look. The Jets, who were 4-12 last year, have a new coach, Adam Gase; a talented, second-year quarterback in Darnold; and several other new players, including the star running back Le’Veon Bell. The new uniforms, he said hopefully, signaled a new era for Gang Green.There was also talk of “brand identity” and a “refreshed logo,” the kind of marketing jargon that all teams use when they hope fans will buy items with the new look. (Within minutes of the unveiling, the new uniforms were featured on the home page of the N.F.L.’s website and its shop.) There was even a reference to work on the new design being “an extraordinary process,” as if it included some historic feat of engineering.“You will see the vision behind the process, including the thought, energy and excitement it took to make this change a reality,” Johnson said. “Our fans asked for this change. So did our players. It was time for a new uniform, time for a new look.”That look that fans allegedly asked for consists of a brand-new color (if that is possible) that the Jets call Gotham Green. Besides sounding like a name for a small park in Manhattan, the tint looks like a slight variation of the green it replaced.A more significant change is the new black uniform, with a hue dubbed Stealth Black, that all the players seemed to like a lot.Gone are the trademark vertical stripes on the shoulders. They were swapped out for pointy horizontal stripes that come around the shoulders and aim underneath the neckline, toward the center N.F.L. logo, which sits above the words “New York” in capital letters. It is becoming ever more popular for teams to put their nicknames on jerseys, but the city of origin is not common.The pants, both white (make that Spotlight White) and green, have the same kind of pointy stripes made popular when the Denver Broncos changed their uniform design in 1997. The straight dual stripes that gave the previous Jets uniforms a classic flavor are gone, and with them goes the traditional old logo, too.The Jets traded in the white helmet and the green NY logo that dates back, with slight variations, to the days of Joe Namath and Don Maynard. (Broadway Joe, by the way, was right there on Broadway on Thursday to sanction all the changes.)The new helmet is shiny (Gotham) green with a white logo that has the word “Jets” above a small football, a nod to the football in the old logo. (The Jets and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are the only teams with a football in their helmet logos.)When the players, including Jamal Adams, Leonard Williams, Quincy Enunwa and Darnold, were brought on stage to showcase the new look, they danced and posed and later echoed the team line that the new look is bold, innovative and fresh.“I think that a lot of old school people are going to have it grow on them,” Enunwa said and added, “It feels like a new team, in a way.”That is the point. But the Jets are only the most recent N.F.L. team to change uniforms. Some have had more success than others. The Patriots changed their uniforms in 2000, and in their second season in a darker blue color, they won the first of six Super Bowls in them.“I think that’s just a coincidence,” Darnold said. “But no, maybe it’s a telltale sign. If we don’t play well, the uniforms are going to look crummy. If we play well, then they are going to look awesome.”Advertisement\n"

      "AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressRENTON, Wash. — Russell Wilson is sticking around with the Seattle Seahawks as the highest paid player in the N.F.L.Wilson posted a video on social media early Tuesday saying, “Seattle, we got a deal,” shortly after agreeing to a $140 million, four-year extension with the Seahawks, his agent Mark Rodgers said. Wilson’s new deal runs through the 2023 season and includes a $65 million signing bonus, a no-trade clause and $107 million in guaranteed money.Wilson’s per year average of $35 million tops Aaron Rodgers’s average annual salary of $33.5 million as part of the $134 million extension he signed last year with the Green Bay Packers.Wilson’s current $87.6 million, four-year deal was signed at the beginning of training camp in 2015 and was set to expire after next season.“Russell’s goal and his hope was that he would continue his career with the Seahawks and continue to bring championships to this town,” Mark Rodgers, his agent, said. “He believes there is still unfinished business, and he is looking forward to pursuing that without having to worry about contracts and his future.”Wilson, 30, had set a midnight deadline for a new deal with Seattle. He wanted certainty about his contract before the start of the team’s off-season workout program, which began on Monday. Wilson showed up for the first day, and by the end of the night was posting a video with wife, Ciara, announcing the agreement.The deal ends the debate about Wilson’s future with the Seahawks, although there seemed to be little doubt he would remain in Seattle for a while. The team held leverage knowing it most likely had at least three more seasons with Wilson under center. Even if he played out 2019 under his current deal, Seattle could have used the franchise tag if needed to keep him under contract through 2020 and 2021 at a reasonable price by quarterback standards.But the extension allows Seattle to budget for the future knowing how to work with Wilson’s hefty paycheck in the years ahead and build a contender around him.Wilson was the second-highest paid player in football behind Rodgers when his deal was signed in 2015, but had fallen to the 12th highest-paid quarterback in the league, according to Overthecap.com.Wilson is coming off arguably his best season as Seattle went a surprising 10-6 and earned an N.F.C. wild card before losing to Dallas in the opening round of the playoffs. It was supposed to be a rebuilding year, but the Seahawks were ahead of schedule thanks to their return to a run-first offense and Wilson’s exceptional performance when tasked to throw.The 5-foot-11 Wilson threw for a career-high 35 touchdowns and matched his career low with seven interceptions. He attempted only 427 passes — his lowest total since his second season when Seattle won the Super Bowl — but his efficiency was a career best with a 110.9 passer rating. He also ran only 67 times, a career low, as the improved run game and offensive line play allowed Wilson to stay in the pocket more and scramble for his life less.It was a stark change from the 2017 season when Seattle missed the playoffs for the first time under Wilson. He led the league in touchdown passes, but also was Seattle’s leading rusher because of a nonexistent run game.The idea of Wilson leaving Seattle has always seemed a stretch. Teams do not usually give up on quarterbacks with the kind of success he has had. Wilson has led the Seahawks to the playoffs in six of his seven seasons, the only miss coming in 2017 when Seattle finished 9-7. He won a Super Bowl in his second season and got back to the championship game a year later before making the one major mistake of his career that will linger until he wins another title, throwing a goal line interception in the final minute when the Seahawks had a chance to take the lead on New England.Wilson has shelved the stigma of short quarterbacks being unable to play in the N.F.L. He’s also been extremely durable, never missing a game while playing through significant knee, ankle and shoulder injuries.Advertisement\n",

      "AdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersLONDON — Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino fears the \"spirit of football\" is being changed by Video Assistant Referee (VAR) after his side fell victim to technology on Tuesday.As it turned out the penalty awarded by VAR against Danny Rose for handball was missed by Sergio Aguero and Tottenham went on to earn a crucial 1-0 win in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final at their new ground.But that could not hide Pochettino's unease at a system that will be rolled out in the Premier League next season.While a sliding Rose's arm did make contact with the ball as he attempted to block Raheem Sterling's shot, no City player appealed for a penalty - evidence in itself that the decision was the kind of marginal one that could be debated all night.Pochettino himself said in the letter of the law it could possibly have been a penalty, but rules on what constitutes handball appear open to interpretation.As it stands in the International Football Association Board (IFAB) rulebook, a player can be penalised for handball if their arms extend 'beyond a natural silhouette' - even if accidental.Manchester United beat Paris St Germain thanks to a late VAR penalty this season after Diogo Dalot's shot struck Presnel Kimpembe on the arm and went over the crossbar - a decision Neymar branded a 'disgrace'.Pochettino was more measured, perhaps as the penalty was saved by Hugo Lloris, but still raised concerns that there are too many grey areas in deciding on handball.\"There's a lot of work to do with VAR,\" he told reporters. \"We know there are many decisions that no one knows if VAR is going to be used or not, to check or not.\"Maybe technically it was a penalty because it was handball, but we do not know the protocol. There are a lot of question marks and a lot of work to do.\"I think it's going to change the spirit of the game and I'm very worried about how it's going to work next season.\"Tottenham fans chanted \"VAR VAR\" shortly after Aguero's penalty miss, when Harry Kane was challenged in the penalty area - a chant that might become a regular refrain at Premier League grounds next season.Even when they celebrated Son Heung-min's 78th-minute winner there was an anxious moment when the validity of the goal was checked by VAR - briefly ruining the spontaneity of the moment, which is an integral part of football.\"It's going to be a tough summer to try to find the best way to work. Is it going to check everything?\" Pochettino said.\"I don't know because today there were a lot of actions you could check. Next season, how is it going to work? Many things we need to try to make clear.\"The spirit and the direction of football is going to change. We are going to see a different sport, not the football we grew up watching, that's for sure.\" (Reporting by Martyn Herman; editing by Sudipto Ganguly)Advertisement\n"

      "AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressNEW YORK — Just as he had the true touch when he threw passes, set records and won two Super Bowls, Peyton Manning has the right approach when looking at some of the NFL's greatest moments.ESPN, NFL Films and the league itself clearly felt that way.Manning, a lock for the Pro Football Hall of Fame when he becomes eligible in 2021, is hosting and serving as an executive producer for \"Peyton's Places,\" a five-part, 30-episode series celebrating the NFL's 100th season. The show debuts on ESPN+ in July, with ESPN and ABC airing special compilations.For the quarterback, it was a labor of love, a journey into pro football's past that was educational, humorous and heartfelt.\"NFL Films has been great throughout this and they approached me about doing it to tell the story of the past 100 years,\" Manning says. \"They certainly had a template and blueprint they wanted to tell, and we had certain people we wanted to talk to and visit and have conversations about how football got started.\"So Manning dived all the way back to Ralph Hay's Hupmobile showroom in Canton, Ohio. He spent time with members of the undefeated 1972 Dolphins; rewatched Super Bowl 3 with Joe Namath; discussed the Immaculate Reception with Steelers and Raiders to get the Pittsburgh and Oakland viewpoints; and discovered intriguing connections to the NFL for Richard Nixon, Jay Leno and Elvis.\"We got to go down memory lane,\" Manning says. \"I have always loved the history of the game and I have learned a lot during this journey, and spent some time with some of my favorite players and contemporaries of my dad (former Saints star quarterback Archie Manning) and guys he looked up to.\"NFL Films has all this great archives of (Bears founder) George Halas talking about being in Ralph Hay's Hupmobile showroom, (Giants owner) Wellington Mara talking about how Vince Lombardi wanted him to take Polaroids and throw them down to the field when Vince was coaching with the Giants. To maybe re-enact it or kind of tell that story, it's kind of why I signed up for it.\"Along the way, Manning channeled his inner comedian, as displayed in TV commercials and as host of \"Saturday Night Live.\"A big fan of Elvis Presley, Manning visited Graceland and \"may or may not\" have dressed up in an Elvis costume. He did discover that Presley staged impromptu games at local parks and was such a die-hard NFL fan he had three television sets on hand so he could watch as much football as possible.\"He got the idea from Lyndon Baines Johnson, who had three TVs so he could watch the news and political news coverage,\" Manning explains.Manning and Cris Carter also tried to replicate a stunt the New York Giants performed at the O'Keeffe Radiator Building in Manhattan — now the American Radiator Building. In 1926, the Giants' Lynn Bomar threw a ball to the ground from 324 feet up on the 23-story building, and Hinkey Haines caught it.\"Back in the '20s, the forward pass was like a circus act,\" Manning says. \"When you were in the red zone and threw a pass into the end zone and it was incomplete, the other team got the ball; that was news to me. Clearly, teams didn't want to throw it.\"But to get some buzz and interest with the team not drawing well, the Giants did this publicity stunt and had (Bomar) throw a pass off the building. So I threw a pass down to Cris Carter at the same spot and he caught it. It was pretty neat.\"Also neat, no doubt, was having Manning service motorist's cars at the Vince Lombardi Travel Plaza on the New Jersey Turnpike. Manning dressed up as an attendant and \"would give them a lecture or seminar on Vince Lombardi\" while they were gassing up. The customers were given $10 off their bill if they could correctly answer questions about Lombardi.Paying homage to one of the NFL's great QBs, Sammy Baugh, who also played safety and was an All-Pro punter, Manning had Deion Sanders \"try to teach me\" to play defensive back. \"That provided some challenges,\" Manning says with a chuckle.He visited with Jay Leno, a renowned classic car collector, to discuss the Hupmobile, an auto on which several future NFL franchise owners sat (on the running boards) \"drinking prohibition beer\" as the league was formed.\"I hope people who love football will find it entertaining,\" he says. \"I certainly have not been afraid to make fun of myself.\"The fun of the series is accompanied by a reverence for the history of his sport. Such highlights as sitting with Roger Staubach and watching the long pass to Drew Pearson that spawned the \"Hail Mary\" description of such plays. Or chatting with Jim Brown about his career — in football and lacrosse and acting. Or researching the role of Bert Bell, the league's second commissioner who created the draft, scheduled games for Sundays — college football, more popular in the those days, owned Saturdays — and insisted on blackouts when television became a factor.\"Bert Bell made a bad investment, putting his money in a pro football team, guys in leather helmets running into each other,\" Manning says with a sarcastic laugh. \"Bert Bell was a pioneer.\"Bell and Nixon likely wouldn't have gotten along. Nixon, as Manning discovered, was so annoyed he couldn't watch the Redskins' home games from the White House during his 1969-74 administration that he asked NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle to lift the blackouts.\"Rozelle refused, saying it would hurt attendance,\" Manning says. \"So, basically, Nixon got Congress to pass a law to end the blackouts. He called it one of the greatest achievements of his administration, and that shows you how important it was to people who wanted to watch their teams. And still is.\"___Advertisement\n"
